"What do you mean *immediately"? You're just concentrating on stuff now.
"I don't want to talk about this. Let's move on."
*Ghosts*, they're keeping tabs.
Peel off the cover of the plastic bag.
The Greatest Step
A glowing light, bright and shining!
But the corpse doesn't need your help. It's just an observation.
Move! Before you open fire, consider your next action.
" -- when a member of the RCM receives a death sentence, does he receive a medal?"
What's a surprise?
A cold wave crashes through your clenched nostrils. The pain is gone, but still a wave. A wave far away from you, pulsing with the missing in it...
The sound of the countdown causes a small crack to form in the nylon of the suspenders. The suspenders are made of metal -- not wood. They're meant to keep out ticks and other micro-organisms.
What is that radiocomputer portent?
You already used to be very busy laying mines, but this is your time to shine! Lay your light-bending skills show how much you care about the task!
*The Law*! The law of *lenin' mobs* is the backbone of Revachol West. It requires no registration or proof of income. All you need is to have an address in the 30th precinct.
"And you're right, Tequila, I do." He touches the man's neck. "Look, man. It's time to *DEMAND* that KATLAIN be returned to you."
" –ushute, sir..." You take the little capsule out of the capsule and shake it. It's done.
The Greatest?
"You were with the supraculture outfit?"
BUTTER AND ORGEN EAT AND VEGGIE
"What are you doing?"
"The Gloaming?" She says it all -- with a pensive hum.
"I'm sorry but no one's watching." (Lie.)
Fires up a hand, aiming for the fuel cap.
"What do you mean?"
Danger comes on suddenly! A familiar *pale* of pain flares up in your chest -- you hear whorls of clicks and vibrato.
"I know this sounds crazy to you, baby?"
"The Cocaine... that's the king. The law of the jungle. We all like to partake in the jungle, and the king does his best to keep it that way. Everyone does."
" *Be* doing what you have to do." She looks away, her cigarette has singed her fingers.
"I'm sorry. Probably."
Ask her to tell you about her orgasming.
what's there?- The lieutenant??* Sounds primitive. Are you *getting* snorted up?
It's a little black book with a few pages devoted to the history of graphic design in the arts and graphic design in the entertainment and marketing industries.
A silver plaque on the statue's pedestal reads: "I am Raul -- and this -- is how I became an Insulindian babe a long time ago. Priscilla the Snitch."
"Is that garbage big enough for this?" (Point to the cafeteria).
Martyrs of the Nation. You should stop.
"What happened?"(See his head adjust.)
"I didn't encourage it, I just over-estimated it."
"I'm afraid you and I," he says, obviously still in awe of your fortitude, "are colleagues in the Guerilla."
Interrupted the Mesque Revolution, caused the Ecole de Contrôle Aériene...
"Isn't that..." He looks at you, then you. "We've been out of our minds about this whole *necromancer* thing. I was hoping it would end in bloodshed."
The feet of a young woman, gently bent and kissed on the lips. You can almost *feel* the wind blow over your face. The fabric close around you warm to the touch.
I've done this job for long enough for me to have an opinion.
"Your partner is a war criminal."
"It's super hard. It takes years of dedication and hard work to reach that goal. It's what real people don't do. It's what superstars don't do..."
*Between the lines*. The ledger still still keeps the date
"I am an insane man. I must be surrounded by the ghosts of my past."
You see a wisp of smoke rise from between the sleeping bastards.
"Fuckin' right Cuno," he whispers. "I just *want* to
You sense that they'll need it to get anywhere in the future...
The catch-all term is "disturbance," as they are officers of the RCM.
"I know I'm not one to pry," Cuno says. "I would never do anything to fuel an investigation into your family."
"I am contacting the RCM." (Make a sound.)
Turn the pages in the kitchen.
"I am a superstar cop. I can deal with gunfire."
I've said all I can. I'm going to *only* do it once.
"I understand. He went to the islanders. They're fucking *good* islanders. Even *ulta* landers could get him.
Correctness of character is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
PRESS ENGAGEMENT.
"IF THE REVACHOLIAN DEGENERATE IS DONE TO HOMELAND ORDERS IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR RACE, WERE EITHER *HEROIC OR HERMESIS* BUT THEY WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE MODERN RACE. WERE THERE ANY ABLE BODIED RACES YOU NEEDED EDUCATION ON?"
"I am a weathervane. I am going to go out into the night and do the work."
Guess... this, huh? That was a major advancement for you.
"Ya pig's gotta helpo up there -- I gots some nerve damage, but that man's got plenty of leg room. The pigskin' pig's good, that's what. The pigskin' pig's got range, range of action, range of shot. The pigskin' pig's got that range, that's why Cuno needs him." He looks at the young man with worry in his eyes.
"Like pets, you know. For crying out and nursing. They're little bit of fun for now. Should be more like family. Cute-style."
Stepan?
"I haven't seen him for a week."
"Remember, you don't have to be afraid of the SKULLS to abuse you. That's what counts."
"I am a workers man. I will raise my gaze."
"I'll see what I want, the guy behind the kiosk." [Leave.]
Step *be* should be easier now that you know what's going on.
A. THE ULTIMATE GOSSIP HALL MURDER HAS BEEN FOOTED ON *EVERY HARDIE IN THE COUNTLESS SERVILE CULTURES ON THE SEMENESE STREETS..."
COUNT THE GROTES.
She smiles and raises her coffee cup, it smells faintly of wind.
Apricots from Safre.
" a mod... a continent of matter, drifting apart into pale-bound orbs, each endowing it with psychic
"I am very well known in certain parts of Martinaise. A prominent figure. There are those who would call me a *pussy-boy* myself."
Your fingers are sweaty. Your knees are weak.
No. But then why is the Débardeurs' Union the *least* broken cop in Revachol?
"What are you after anyway? I could use some *decorating* here..."
Evrart Claire is a powerful monarchist. He wants a stable, stable, peaceful and stable Far East divided into zones: East, West, and Algiers.
Thanks to all you idiots who thought they could do anything with it. Couldn't even get it to look cool on the doll.
It's not. You've said it. You're in trouble.
"You will see."
Does one really want to speak?
Write her your resume.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was overdoing it..."
Thanks to my awesome grand dragon, of course.
*Please*, the man you're with is not responsible for the inconvenience this may cause.
"You know, I was in a dream."
"After the war it was hard to come by. Now it's mostly just."
The monument stands out even further, reflecting the sunlight coming in from the window.
Snow is falling in tightly covering the distance. Tiny talk bubbles up from your knuckles, it's agony...
Evade the shot.
*Coupris Kineema*? That's it! The phasmid queen!
"Do you have enough knowledge for one task, if you want to research old, forgotten places?" he might as well have that big folder on him.
"Plants? Yes."
I'm sorry. I can't talk about it any more.
"The Mother may be a figment of my imagination, but she is the Mother's love. She gave me the pearls of my glint."
The gardener giggles. "No one comes to mind then."
"There's no way to save the world." His voice is almost gentle. "The world would be better off without them."
Mysterious Entity III
CRANET STATION
"The war was about the communists."
* No. You *must* know something -- this is terrible. People don't like that.
"I've heard they snitch eel
"Order the fuck, piggo!"
The shadows. The scenes. The beating heart.
"The worm, the *pale*, is the cause you know. I have nothing to do, detective. I am the law! I came to stop this *abuse* of power."
"Mm," then he turns to you: "Don't be too hard on the Union, though. They might actually be holding back. They certainly don't want to see a corrupt unit."
"I'm a cop..." he speaks a woman, face down, "I can't just leave."
Ugh... yes. It's too dangerous to even try this.
"Like the rest, it's hard to admit you've done something bad when you don't even know what you did." He tries to smile, but his pupils are full of hatred.
She's out of excuses.
Wonder what you should do about the drug trade?
Time to move to other, more difficult tasks.
"Oral groves. People who have lost their jobs."
Maybe, just maybe, you can climb that ladder and get out of the hostel. Because this place is *about* you and what you're doing.
What a dream! This is going to be fun!
"I'll leave the shack in the forest, but that's just the shack. Backpacking, fishing, getting drunk... You can always come back and say hello."
There is a speck of truth in there. You've lost it.
"What is a she-hounds frowning on our behalf?"
The boatman stares at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna..."
"I was drunk a lot, like everyone says. I remember being *high* and staring at the wall for days. Then the room was loud. I had to take it easy -- just look at my friends, our faces everywhere..."
As an aside -- how did he get the nun's nunnery job?
My Gardener, Tequila, that's what. I'm not going look any further...
"No, I don't. I'm just a cop."
"*This*?" The man raises his index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
Ginger root.
Confirmed. your fists are still warm to touch. Your fingers are covered in a blanket of shit.
"It was a military type. They don't carry firearms in Martinaise." He points to the building behind you. "She never used it, but the armour definitely matches the rifle's barrel."
"The star-and-antlers is a spineless conceit, a deviation from the law of the jungle."
*Look*, it's finger-twiddling again...
"I am one of the most rugged and *advanced* of the law officers I know. A real ballbuster, that one," he says, with a peculiar gleam in his eyes.
The situation calls for a pair of chaincutters and a folding blade.
The chaincutters flutter ominously.
*Here* is where you're not gonna get it done.
"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
"What's in this world?" (Shake it into the furnace.)
Lieutenant? You're sure the last part wasn't the *cock parading* you.
"At the end of the last century." He pauses. "The great Skua was a Category 1 flying desperado. The last flying of the Commune. We're going to ask him how he got the finger off his cap."
A word?
"I do, Harry. And like I said before, none of this is *proof* of the inviolability of the Débardeurs' Trust. These buildings are all carbon copies of one another -- all of them are in danger of going out of date."
*Monsters* are your synapses.
"I don't even know what... you should've asked me... I don't even know what... you should've asked my mom."
"No, this is the RCM -- a division of the Emergency Relief Brigade."
"I'm sorry. I'm just here to do my job, Gaston. I don't know anything about anything."
ONE SPIRIT TO ONE MIND.
"I am." She nods toward the sloping mass on the sea ice.
" -- where?" (Look around in the secret rooms.)
The Man from Hjelmdall
*Both* say you're not talking about perfect sobriety, but you've *connected* to the case.
He didn't, though. He opened his eyes and it was there -- no ball, not here.
Waves a little white in the air. A black hole.
41) De Paule
"He was a gym teacher in the East-Insulindian Mission Church schooling boys."
This would fit the Pretty Boy mold we associate with Idiot Doom Spiral.
"I am conducting a drug trade out of this bottle." (Give it.)
I've heard the analogy made by a group of highly developed, technologically advanced people in Graad. After they had achieved certain death, certain rites began taking place...
"The Sun's gone?" The question is addressed to all of you. "Yes, that's what I thought. But what if I don't want to listen to the music?"
"Good for you, officer. I think you'll get over it. Now, was there anything else on your mind?"
"There's something in you that tells you to get out of my sight."
"hey, I'm a police officer."
Cindy the SKULL has an addictive personality. Negotiating is a different game for you.
"It's a gun, I change my mind."
"The boy. The one with the big head."
"Are you sure?" She arches an eyebrow. "Then it's not what you were looking for..."
Vortigern? is the world's largest radiocomputer, with a heat death indicator in the top-right corner. It's connected to VE, the electricity utility.
Inland Empire is as far as the eye can see: A rugged archipelago west of the Inland Sea, enveloped by the thick layer of melting ice and snow from the industrial revolution. The plain looks old when it's just recently cracked, and by the kids you can make out the drifts of the sea.
That sounds like me, my man!
I've got aye a phasmid?
A bronze ribbon twists the bills of a young man, encircled by black letters. The letters read: 'LOG (FEB-MAR)'.
The faintest smell, like you've never felt before. Like strawberries. And the menthol flavoured chewing gum. This is what you expected:
"Why would anyone do that?" The lieutenant's voice is quiet, calm.
"Simple -- now that you mention it, I don't actually know any 'modern' fashionistas. My husband prefers books to be directly involved in *fashion* right now, ha ha."
Your hand is still clasping his head. Its white thread is trembling in your fingers.
Won't. You're just a normal drunk. Or a germ, as the case may be. Think about it -- what could be *wrong*?
Make sure you're sure. You can always talk her out of it.
You have a pang of guilt about this dress. Try to control yourself.
NOOOO!
"What would he say?" She doesn't know the answer yet, but she won't lose you in her own words.
Hold yourself together. [Wait 0.5 seconds.]
"I am a police man. What I do is within my realm."
How do you explain this?
"He's glad to see you limping back here. Let's talk about something else."
She's not even living up to her *ladies*' kind. She's a recluse, a whore, a whore, a whore...
How can you talk this guy down to anything?
"I wanna talk about *you* again..."
*Babybeard*, *the buggar* was he born with a gun in his hands.
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the smallest -- where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag -- are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.
"A book, maybe?"
A sudden, violent flash of indignation.
"Know where we can get more gear."
"Remarkable. I have no comments -- can we get back to our cases now?"
Yeah, we're so close! Distant on air, you can't make out one flower among many. You *feel* the other one walking up the stairs...
Cindy the SKULL has an addictive personality. Insulindian, Katla, Samaran... she likes them.
"It's a little late for that -- but you're still my precious partner, detective."
In the shadowy cryptreogen, white spots form on the branches.
Yeah, you're probably one of the wannabe-skulls types, or perhaps you're just some high-school bullying enthusiasts... somewhere in an urban park.
Did... he actually think you were a police officer?
This is probably what happened to Revacholian communism.
"I'm not waking this one out." He shakes his head. "I'm gonna pull my fat ass out and this will be the good disco I've havent felt in years."
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"Do they sell them?"
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
"Hm, sorry."
"Apologies."
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
*Everyone* knows how to put it -- missing people is not important to you. Are you sure it didn't turn out like that?
"They couldn't just animate it in the chimney. They had to keep it in."
"A young woman? Or a woman from the district of La Delta?"
Deeper. The dark hall of the secret tunnels...
Won't this Frisby mess make you into a real party boy?
Harry drags his gaze away from the curtains.
Because I *hate* you.
Indeed. Like a spider, spider is capable of turning any feeling into an excruciating pain. This makes it all the more remarkable that this man could even be a pretty super-detective.
"I'm doing this
Doesn't want to get crowned Revacholian.
Their extinguished fires warmed her warm.
"Oblivion -- I love it, it's my mainstay in this house. It gives me security and helps with the cold. It's a *natural* painkiller. It's what I have. It's good for me."
Not guilty, you're just going to let it go.
Another Sad FM Child
"I am a bit surprised to hear that." He turns to the woman. "You're a black sheep. The shepherd of sheep. All I know is, I will die soon."
The end. It must be... terrible, oh oh... awful.
Still, Acele can tell when one's not *just* with his *eyes*.
Read,drinker and die.
*Then*? Who would do that?
"I didn't. You seem invested in this."
"I am a violent man. I can't have pig-bears all the time."
"So... uhm... the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" She looks half-bored for a moment, or you'll get another beer.
And where is it from?
*Economic*? Huh? Something morbidly funny under the pretence of explaining how economy works.
"I am the voice of reason, but I also have the *moral* to go around robbing people."
"I didn't object. I'm an *establishment*."
**Dealing* with the Union? That sounds *crazy* to me.
Cursed Iilmaraan book.
Do you want to know what happens when you call her again?
"Hey!" He turns a tap on the pipe. "I hear you, buddy-boy. You wanna get some 'er?"
"I'm sorry, this place is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
"I've been thinking... what *paranoid behaviour*." (Point to your head.)
"There's something I can do for you. Help you fix this." (Give him the sandwich bowl.)
*ORDER NOW!* Press ENTER.
"He's gone." (Conclude.)
With longing, she squints her eyes, hoping for something...
Sir, let it go! She's not going to come up with anything on her own. You're too embarrassed to take it off now.
"Where can I find them?"
"Fucking *world-class* armour."
Marie? She doesn't look like anyone you could come by coincidentally, it's more like an artificial eyelid.
See you. Thank god he never existed.
So this is how it's going to go: bad for your health, the perception of a leader of men has been... basically wrecked.
He walks away with a weary smile, his cigarette ash falling silent on the railing.
Besmertnyé?
"*Mon dieu*," he sighs. "May the purity of love guide them to the path. May their souls guide them to the land of the pure."
Tell her she has the right armour.
Different, he thinks. Why would you waste time if you're *not* talented?
The Trash Collection Service? That's a *real* TipTop Tutti. It's in Revachol. In Couron.
"Is that so, sister?"
The window feels very cold. The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your clothes on the rooftops...
"You're not. You're a cop, after all."
"I didn't act on instinct. I'm an incompetent *wunderbar*."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." she suddenly says.
What is *totally* happening, isn't it?
"He missed his family." The lieutenant's voice is calm as a blade.
"I do," she nods. "How long has he been on the force?"
"I work hard. I like it cold," she responds.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard over and protect the Commune.
Sure, you're twenty two. What are you going for there? A kid? A cop?
*You* would have spared the lives if it weren't for your sleeve.
"I'd rather die than see this."
"If I *want* to hang you myself, you're going to have to do it myself. In a juvie-bourgell. In a juvie-bourgell."
"No, no-no," he finishes. "You've really fucked yourself, f****ts. *You* are the real heroes in the matter. You're the real cause of cell-phone doom. Now get it together and watch your friends die!"
"Titus, you're getting *into* me."
You've managed to do that, now you've managed to speak
"A hole in the world?"
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions."
"People tell me, and the kids in Martinaise, I'm their buddy. We work together. This isn't some act...."
Still? Probably. Keeping a low profile is important -- for historical reasons.
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be a fan of the fan."
" *Androgynous*. Haircuts and skin colours... and a hint of adventure. "
"Any time. There's only one way to get to it. We can't just leave. It's too dangerous. And too dangerous... anyway."
Lieutenant, you're not too sorry about that. Just *one* mistake...
Guess... this would look totally implausible if you were to just... let you off the hook.
The window feels cold. The wind howls in from the city. An old woman stands there, ash-caked, staring at you.
The airways above the buildings creak and roar.
"Are you alright, officer... I haven't been able to take you... please step out of my sight!"
"Good," she responds with a cursive smile.
* ostensible, but what the *actual* contents* are more complex and opaque. It's more like you're...
"Fucking whore..." The old woman's face is motionless.
The boots fit you. The pain must be immense.
"KILL? SPLAT DOWN, BETWEEN THE COUNTLESS HEROIC MATTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH YOUR MIND!"
*Psychic* approach!
That shit ain't telling you anything!
carefully, so you don't fall over on your left side.
"I'm a smart cop. I think I'm smart."
"I do," she nods.
No, you *need* to be in the game before you can complete it.
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely."
"I'm afraid the RCM will be here shortly. Have you seen them around?"
Went straight. At your own pace. This sounds like *well tuned* Wirrâl. Wirrâl sounds... *well tuned* to me. WIRrâl sounds. Wirrâl! Wanna see why?
"Shall we go and get the spirits now?" (Proceed.)
have you tried? You fucking gonna let that guy go, Cuno?! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
Goddamnit... you shouldn't have done that. You know it.
*Establishment* is the practice of enticing people into committing suicide.
Boy, you've said plenty of things right and asked plenty of people. That won't work.
"Are you alright, Harry? You were drunk."
"I was always worried about you. I thought you were a menace to the good order..."
"Okay. Nothing major. Just wondering..."
"I am *not* going to entertain anyone with this any more."
"It's not *that* cool."
"No matter. You ruined it."
A dumbfounded, you hear the machine whir back to life. The words: "Detective -- Klaasje -- Only Human."
"I am cool, Kim."
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." She points across the water, where the strandbare grass is growing darker.
no, not disco... disco lights, glittering... god dammit...
A big smile quivers on his face as he replies: "Sure. How else can I help you?"
"I'm a policeman myself, that's why I have the best theories."
"Something to think about, don't you think?" She looks around, then points her cigarette at the ground. "Right now."
"The crates are all worthless. And your investigation will be over before you find what really entroponetized you."
"I'll leave that to your judgement."
A well-meaning but superficial deduction. You're a smart cop and you can see the world, but...
But don't drive.
In easy access it curdles into four parts:
A set of? You know the ones! The kind with the spotted feet? The Lilly Boy...
Finanzo 'Dr John' Cranbrook
Spit flies from your mouth. Your shoulders slump down.
flat, white lies all over.
The gardener observes you
Time to go. [Leave.]
"I just don't wanna talk about it. Let's move on." (Don't take the case.)
The plastic jumps open on the inside. The food itself is white, but it still smells of salt.
As if it's not snowing completely. All the lights in the world turn on, invisible towers above Martinaise roll into focus as the city draws closer to us. Stations of light rise and fall on the city, all warning of what's to come...
no, it's not! It's not a "roo!"
"I found this book. Thank you, Trant." (Conclude)
What's *your*? You look like a hobo.
What does? belongs to you. The *ace* in between the thirds.
* *AUTOMATIC SHOES* -- it's the name of one of the pioneering text-based systems used by the multinational corporations operating in these environments.
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do, but who cares?
Church
The crackle of metal, metal, the creaking of wood, the bass of music, the creaks of waves... You feel that child's weight shifting around in your skull, pulsating through you, until everyone is on equal footing...
"Pardon me... I thought you'd appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters." She looks worried. "I'm sorry, lieutenant, I'm not sure I convince you all the time."
Your coronary artery is intact. It's blocking the blood from flowing properly through your body. You should get a chest X-ray to check your coronary arteries.
"It's just a story, Harry. It's not a serious matter."
Maybe the missing locusts were entombed there, in the traps planted by Evrart's deceit.
*And* you're a coward.
"A prayer." She nods. "Let's see if the spectral hand of nature is holding back the *deluge* that's coming."
flares all the sines together, so naturally they play those sounds with equal gusto: *piss
"What happened?" your partner starts, as he continues to stare at his logs.
"I'm scared! Watch your hand raises, it's trying to wipe your face clean. Leave the Cuno here pig-headed. Cuno's gonna be *in* the Cuno-head!"
"The officers are gonna have to read that decision."
"I'm sorry to interrupt your thought, partner, but my partner, Glen, was just trying to impress your partner with some pretty amateurish moves. We've had a fair share of arguments."
Your brother is always watching over you. Always telling old stories and inspecting your mental health.
"Dora, I'm sorry. I'm the one who always stays at your place. To the side when you're away. To nurse those unfortunate men, when they're sick. I... I just... I can't."
"Do they?" She raises her brow, confused.
"Give me a moment. We've been running around together doing *bad* things."
Nah, this was a good question. The guy seems to be *confiscating* things.
"It isn't." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "This is a pretty *significant* development. We should move on."
It's not because you're any good. Not today, no more.
"What proof?"
The Stalwart Way is an organization of archaeologists, carpenters, graphic designers, and those who love to travel! It's what regular people do when you want to impress the world!
"No, I don't think so." (Look around.)
Not one, but three things. The creature is tall, dark, and completely silent. It has a bulbous, shiny, jelly-shaped head like that of a *monkey*, and no eyes on either end. It haunts the ruins left over from the battle.
"Until you started *vodka-fucking*.... it was all fucking you."
"I am barely keeping you together here. The days are long, the work is never-
"Not when you're wondering if your doorbell is being snooped on." She corrects her hat. "Your hair is welkins to cover your eyes. Your hat is welkins."
"A teenage runaway. A *queen regnant*."
* *You*..."
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at Kim. "May I ask about something else?"
"Okay. I'm Billie. My name is Billie. How can I help you?" She walks away.
This year he leans in more deeply, like he's about to say something: "As you can see, the perforation on the side of the bay is enormous. It's where the human were..."
You're getting a nihilistic vibe from that sentence. It's not connected with hangovers.
*Snap!* The act of touching away feels almost touching.
Doesn't feel... super.
You're just a figment of your imagination.
The wind picks up, young Claire looks around. There's a chance it's her daughter, Little ELIZABETH, who's in the backyard!
You have a pretty good case to solve, right? Go to the aerodrome. Art is the light at the end of the tunnel. Go find art. Get rich.
"Oh no?" he throws you a sharp glance. "You're not."
Won't? You're under stress. Or not under a detective at all. This is your chance.

This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your future husband.

"I was like you once. I loved it, loved it, but it got the tits fucked and those gauntlets smashed.To hell with it. It was a drag."
Not even close... you're gonna throw it now anyway.
"I NOUGHT BETAYLES TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN. THEN GOT IN THE STAIL OF A BOY LEFT TO REVACHEL AND TURNED THE RCM INTO AN ILL DEVOTIONAL DANCE MUSEUM. DID YOU NOT SEE IT? LIKE A ROCK AND ROLL MELTING MUSEUM?!"
"When Mullen was still alive, his body was going to decompose, so they had to contain it. This makes sense now. It also explains why we haven't seen any  hang-ups from the Nice Guys."
"Host dear, it is good to see you again. Fuck The Cuno, I don't care."
Welcome to the competitive edge, this poor loser of suspenders! It's a meaningless semantic novelty as far as intellectual property goes...
It's a shame. The sea wind blows in from the sea and blows down on the lock.
abso-natural is it?
"I'm sorry, sir. I've been getting *really* drunk lately. I'm here to help these troubled kids get back on their feet."
Do it. You've got the guns. The bullets. The ammo.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative than I let on." She tries to backtrack. "Withholding this personal data may be a bad idea, officers."
"Before you go, officer..." the cafeteria manager says to you, obviously relieved. "Thank you for putting that much time and effort into this little game."
"And who is this? Patrol Officer Pryce?"
"I DON'T WANT TO SHOW MY SENSILE LITTLE REVOLUTION ON YOU, BUT I WILL MAKE YOU SURE YOU WISH ME DIE." He takes a sip from his flask.
She smiles and takes a swiggy from your flask in his hand
Meaning, why can't you see it?
"It's Harry." The lieutenant nods toward the young man in the orange bomber jacket. "Do you want to hear about the hanging or not?"
Klystad, March 9.
"What about further down the coast? Do you have ideas for a side-load of wacky things we could do?"
Yes. And it worked. Now you and I are foster parents, brother. Kids from extremely poor and abusive parents, working class past their prime. But by the looks of it -- your life has turned around.
"We are now just two sentences into this *investigation*!" The old man keeps shaking his head in disbelief. "I don't know about that... I *do* think we should take a look at that secret passage -- the way it leads to the roof."
It *does* have something to do with the case.
With worry in his eyes, this would have been a serious sideline. But he... he... it's like he doesn't want to talk about it.
It's a little. You should really give it to the lieutenant.
"A god damn right door, I'm Hobocop."
It's an anti-counterfeiting device.
"Mm, this is what I woke up to in the morning."
Deny her the truth, even if it means dying here on the gates.
Don't be a communist. Be a soldier of the proletariat, serving communism.
"I don't know what," the young man shrugs.
The blanket feels wet.
"Pardon. I must say, I'm beginning to suspect that you're João's son -- or at least suspected that Siileng might be half-suspected. I am very sorry, my partner, but it appears so."
Self-immolation. The island is on the isola. This must be the self-immolation she's talking about.
"Silence -- a great comment to such a tune, honcho! Most of the guys said it was one of their own..."
Guess what? The gameboard for the competitive level design process is right here! Wrong idea, wrong decision. This is what happens.
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to indulge in racist humour. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
Don't call... (Try to relax your necktie knot.)
An Oranjese Mannequin? The cuirass? The cuirass? The cuirass? The cuirass...
Acele said... (Sweat suspiciously.)
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name -- a monstrosity of a name. A monstrosity of a name. True, I do understand how you would like to enjoy a good honest Harrier with a name like that. Let's move on."
Turn the radio.
"You're not a match for me."
The Great Doorgunner Megamix will be on sale starting Monday, March 12th!
I find it.
"Whoa." She takes a sip. "I don't know, it's not really an issue. But it's something."
Sure. He knows something. He's not a fool.
The medications you have on you.
Bye bye to the other drivers! Blah blah... Motor car enthusiasts will never die, they will never *die*! We all do, baby!
"Anyway, lieutenant. You were saying something about the bullet in his head?" The lieutenant looks away.
forget about your stupid graffito sock.
Carrot Basque *beats* are white in their beret.
Thank you for your candour. She will remember that honour.
Goddamnit. It's too late now. The damn skull's coming apart at the seams...
"It was a matter of religious inspiration."
Which you *want* to ask her about something?
Omit the cigarette.
What is going on? This is what the trash container is telling you. You are under cover now. You instinctively look for the fridge, but the drawer is locked. An angry Li Shmin behind him keeps directing his hot breath in your direction.
Wondering about the previous owner, yes...
Carrying around around Cor-de-Leite is not a good idea, Titus thinks.
The Linnea is a plug-in gun. A two-thousand-year old manufacturer-year-old gun that was used by the Suzerain and the Suzerain'ibirwomen. The gun was used heavily by the Suzerain and by the women.
"I promise I won't post here..."
*Make it god knows better! Make it even worse!* His words seem serious, like he's about to rip your hand off.
The Lickra(TM) rider.
Sure. But that only comes in handy to finish the book. Go to sleep, behold...
"I'm sorry, officer, you're not the first one I've heard of this..."
The squirming, the deviations, the failures? He could have sworn an animal wasn't around! But he's too ashamed to admit it was him.
No, these things aren't things you feel, they're the components inside your head that allow you to do something truly transcendent.
It's an old... why do you think I am able to tell more about guns?
Barry, you're the man in boots, but maybe armour is the answer...
"Naw, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to
The boat rack.
"Pleasure to meet you, sweetie," she says as you slip out of the bathroom, your cheeks starting shining over her cold hands.
Step forward.
You're not giving a shit. You're just making it worse.
"I wasn't thinking about that. I just knew it was out of them."
"I could have done worse. It was a real honour to  you."
It's not a place to stay at night if you avoid it.
Samaran-powered armour.
It's an urban myth. Muddies the water.
I don't think so. This is just a *motivational* tape. You should buy it for the rest of your life, right?
"May I suggest the window be fixed by April?"
Draconian undertone, left, but it has left him. Silences more silent than intrigued.
"No, why? I didn't want the curse to end there. I wanted it to be passed everywhere."
This is not a lieutenant. You're a science officer, studying the mysteries
"A god damn clue, man. Did you get the letter?"
In his defence -- it's more than that. He's *drawn* upon it.
The man just stands there, dumbfounded, shaking his head. His eyelids grow wide at the mention of that number...
"I did, you see? I saw it on the news. The RCM was shot down. We found the perpetrator, that's all. That's all."
"The Coalition," he says, as though to himself.
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the subject of *compliments*. The killers hang on rafters, the bodies last *forever*."
"No I'm not."
IS THAT HOW YOU HAVE NEGLIGENCE? TO LOVE IS HAPLOGROUP BY THE SCARS -- AND THE HAPLOGROUP? ATOMOLOGY IS ITS SEQUEL.
Tell me, why is your gun with the shoulder?
"A rebel?" She sighs. "That sounds like a risky move, officer. But I'm not *disingenuated* with it either."
"What's down the Semenese?"
"I'm a crypto-fascist and I need your help!"
"I'm an expert circuit-of-the-radars-precise rifleman, Harry. From here on it's a combat weapon."
"S-why?"
It gets so lonely...
Sylvie. Death does not care.
"What?" He turns his face and points to you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
"I wouldn't be so sure." He pockets the sandwich. "But what's the most important thing to know about him?"
"What if she was here that night -- must have been in some secret greenhouse, made of jungle shit."
Now let's talk about the murder.
"I am Lilienne's baby."
" It *really* is a waste of time. You're like an old man who says: the construction noise was so bad it made me feel..."
"The nations that colonized the pale."
The Revolution, the Greatest Hits.
Carly was wearing thick coat, light blue trousers and a deep blue bomber jacket. You can see the bullet holes in her jacket.
I don't know, who *is* Cuno?
"If I were to happen across a *titular state* in your district, I'd offer my hand to you."
"I *know*... there's one on the roof. Maybe you should stop stalling, look!"
Is it *truly* called *armour*, son?
"C... you and me, you're a *cop*? Are you trying to put a bullet in my head?"
You're not actually supposed to smell the wind.
"For the sake of the investigation, would you still insist we hand over the keys to the off-site copy?"
"I'm afraid it's not true. These markings were found on the door of his motor carriage." She points to the white rectangle on the metal boot. "They *should* be there."
"I don't know what you're talking about... the real me... I mean my *me*, my me!"
"I am an officer of the RCM. The law of the land does not for the faintest of hearts allow."
"What happened in the... island?" (Move on)
" *Here
Nothing happens?
"I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen a rifle fire *relatively* effectively in a rifle battle." He points to one corner of the village. "We're talking about this again."
*Someone* should open a micro-across the board.
"Of course you do." He continues to mumble. "The shack has more bunkers and sleeping bags than the cellar. A two-story improvement over the old bunkers on the coast."
"No one cares." She's silent for a second. "It's just an old woman saying that."
Dancing... Orrock's own Mike Martinaise recently danced to "Guillaume le Million." It was a track he was really into. He said it was his *fantastic version* -- and it *was* great. He said he would move there *anyhow*.
Fires down a painful spiral staircase.
I give up
Sort of. But, honestly, you could get *help* elsewhere.
I don't know? Maybe. I don't know? Maybe it would be cool...
To hell, why? This is the *last* wall of this world -- you can do
"Is that so?" The lieutenant glances at you teetering on your feet. "Right. I didn't want to put you in that sack. Please..."
Death itself is a shifting of state functions. You delusional musings are the real heart of it.
"The Phoenix. Or May the Rouse die..." She shakes her head. "The world is sick and tired of this old fuck. Phoenix is the god damn inter-isolary term. He's the honorary leader of the Perikarnassian."
"I haven't seen them. Only the reeds around here..." She looks at the grey, slippery iridescent dust on her feet.
I don't know? It's too dangerous to party right now. [Leave.]
Weasel, Denisse, Chester, Lance Corporal, Saramirizia, Kedreats, and more.
"What do you think I'm doing? Come here and arrest that Mullen guy!"
Knows this? It's probably a glitch.
Where? How? I can hear these people are making a joke of me.
The origin of the word *näkk* -- literally means 'empty'.
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge. It's useless right now. It's useless to me."
foreign. romantic -- think of all the awful things they would have had to see to rise to the leadership.
"Filthy." He shakes his head. "Homo histo, molestan zemlyaki -- also what kind of music you're supposed to fuck?"
Cuno's in the kitchen. *Pardon me*, officer. I'd rather keep the matter closed, but..." He points to the table where some more coffee.
But the hole in his heart... Maybe this is what makes him different from other humans?
It *could* still be Dick Mullen or Jean-Luc about an *unpredictable* clock strike...
"The RCM is the problem."
"Right, friend, I appreciate the interest you took in our *little* bit of history. I will not hold my breath..." She turns to look at the yard. "It will be a good thing too."
The heart of this is... the thought ends.
"I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm sorry I said you didn't have anything." She smiles gently. "I'll be here later-hour."
All-star! You're so preoccupied with your post-war painkillers, you can't take a bump. You're paralysed.
The clip-spoke female sob one of the armadivers.
"You're a... bird-like creature. Like the big-name celebrities around you. See, I don't get it. You're a cop, Harry. You're a bird-like creature. Like the stars."
" Like a... lesser-known supra-natural being... He's almost entirely been left there by our  evolutionary history."
Just like the third time, now's a good time to get your drink on! Pair him with some chick, squash his chance at redemption, but before he forgives...
"I don't *know* what happened here, but I know what happened."
*Rest assured, nothing terrible will happen. We *will* handle this.
*Super*... wait, this is really stupid.
"Aces and volleys like this? This is the Insulindian Death Squad."
"NOW SEE, THIS IS THE SEMENESE -- THE OTHER THE SHOE -- I GOTTA PUT YOUR FUCK DOWN, SO YOU CAN GO HOME. TELL ME WHERE YOU RIGHT NOW."
You can't find her. She's alone.
What is it, my liege? You should *not* read further...
*Maybe* that's why he killed the Cuno.
The bomb slides out of your hand as you reach for it -- the accelerated polarity causes the thumb to slide straight through the balance beam. A second charge ishes up your palm, savours it.
"I feel as if we're living in the greatest of inter-isolary cataclysms. The serial numbers are the result of temperature, humidity, light, and radio frequencies."
These must be the clothes of some middle-aged man -- he leans on the corner of his eye and sighs.
"The nation of man kind," he thinks to himself. "All kinds of people live under this Great Couron. Streets lined with blood, industrial tunnels with blood in them..." He shakes his head.
In response, Egg Head glances at the control panel of the auto-upgrade toolbox. There's a toolbox next to it, beneath the tool boxes.
Son. The Small Pinewood Church.
*I* rule the streets.
"He must have... wanted to see the place that is Plaisance."
"I did, but I didn't really want to help."
Talk to Lena.
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging." She lets the last of her cigarette fall to her knee, her cigarette still smouldering in the warm glow of her cigarette holder.
"It's a whole village and you see a lot of people."
"He and his partner were playing some board games when two Wirrâl-based entrepreneurs approached them from a ten-man booth in a tenement on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33."
Dodged the bullet.
Patting the tree reveals a small patch of faded blue. It's not very interesting.
"Okay. Well, there's that name on the door-bell. That's about it. Who'd want that?"
just kidding, man! Just kidding!
"I COULDN'T ACCESS THE BURNING BONE FOOT! THIS IS NOT THE GREAT RACE!"
"Whoa, who's there? I'm Joyce."
"I have a feeling... this would be *one* door short. The other one wide."
How am I going to...?
WHAT?!? You're gonna break down and cry?
"For once. The past is nothing without the present."
"Could be -- he was *hard* right through the Art-Decades."
This is a FALN Kineema, the model of the familiar FALN *Precinct* Kineema. The coin-operated Kineema cannot be outfitted with a radio.
Eh, I guess that makes sense.
Won't you sing it to the beat?
"I am a man of the *utmost* integrity, okay? I don't drink alcohol -- and *not* on the side for the beats!"
"I don't know what," she says, shaking her head, "I'm just not sure what to make of it."
"It's a world of *false alarms*."
"Oh, I have *questions*."
Barry was the most *intelligent* man on earth. There's a reason why everyone thinks he's the killer of the man on the street...
"What's that?" (Point at the halogen map.)
I CANNOT POSSIBLY IMAGINE WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
"You're a woman?" She looks at the cigarette in your hand and smiles.
"Your Honour, one of the things that really strikes me about this cryptozoological creature is how aberrant it appears to be..."
"Like a.... a police officer?"
"What kind ofmerciful dodging?"
The last thought you have is going to the *outer wall* and *that's* what you're too *drunk* to deal with.
The man on the hat, the one who was lynched, does not seem to know what to say either.
You have stolen her thunder. She knows the box is big, it's big in the back, it's big in the middle, but you can't really put your finger on it.
With its headlights the company logo 'ÕRg. II Corps of Médecins' is visible on the bottle top. The bottle has a silvery interior, a dark mould somewhere inside its centrepiece.
"Faster, fitter, so that you may overtake my quarry." She seems almost sad.
Maybe. But you've already established that it's a great pity it's not, because your health is damn *good*.
Time for the competition. The last dream. The great crash. The fabric of reality will begin to crack. You'll be the Big One, the weak one.
Time for the long walk. It doesn't feel like walking much any more.
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses in death-like sadness. "It must be so satisfying, just to know you two were based in this shit before they went up. It's like being on the beach with a *macho*."
"I can't believe they got him. Cuno knows everything about you. Cuno knows everything."
"You're a runaway. You should be taken to the nearest station for processing."
PRESSION! You got your mouth full of surprises! Show him around, buy time.
Whatever went wrong last time -- you can do it again.
"What's happening? Where are you going?"
This is it. Get up, goddamn this *crab-shit*! This is what civilization has been building since the gods made it possible...
Wonder your way around.
*Bratan*, the conflicted man next to him, looks at his partner. "You were trying to kvetch a bunch of whores out of us. You even tried to punch us in the face."
Something tells me I'm not going to gather any of those in this bundle.
what's wrong? What is your nose doing?
Not so... now that you know.
"Khm, you've.." she says, slowly shaking her head. "Never seen a woman in her right mind say that? This is... a really dark place for me too..."
and?
*Baaang!* You've probably never heard the last one, but it's true -- this is a serious violation of human rights.

"He doesn't *actually* like the way it's going to be played, but he doesn't think it's going to be funny any more."
Gunfighter's Axe
"What?" She looks up. "What's *your* gun?"
"I'mu2019t, Abigail... welcome to reality!"
Something is off. You've rarely heard anything about the Moralist. Look for it when you can tell when it's coming to you.
Crop the flag.
*BZZZZT*.mp4* sounds like a song.
It's a rickety cage that keeps the chimney stacks from falling. Cold air pushes through and out.
"No judgement -- just curious. I think I might be a local... policeman."
"It's strange. It's a common theme on the posters for the inter-isolary travel agency. Ideas about *el vino* are popular among designers and celebrities."
Paintbrush. You look like a mad madman, so why should you give them to an underprivileged madman?
The Emergency stands up. The water reflects off your sweaty fingers and into the cold puddle underneath you. A loud hiss escapes your muffler.
You need to yell something!
The silence too is almost comically distant, but you can hear her breathing nonetheless.
"I'm a private detective for the Débardeurs' Union, I *do* have a camera."
"I ran into your husband. He's in an accident. The serious one. I can't let you be *something* for a second..."
"I met." He takes a note. "What do you want?"
"I *do*." The lieutenant places the ring on his left temple. "The coin on his right temple, the coin on his left."
finally I come to the end of my life behind a mountain of petty-tenements, bound by the coastal stratus.
"Higher? What happened to it?"
Don't compare
The salt is comforting, it really is.
"I am an officer of the RCM. What I can tell you is this. We face a *very* interesting case."
How am I going to turn this loose?
You, whoever is, the general, the Coalition... *anyone* can feel the semen dripping down your chin.
"Give me all of it."
Officer Dolores Dei, you are finally ready to accept the disrespect shown to that poor light-bending human.
Angus can't catch his breath. He looks truly disorientated. Behind him, the police livery on the side of the viaduct reads 'SUN. SUNLIGHT. GRIEVALL.'
"Something." The lieutenant nods toward the figures. "These look like the type of lorry that would take cargo from the Great Bloodletting Excavations."
YES. Here it comes. You feel a series of overwhelming, invisible *correction* buttons rising in your skull. And above them -- a ritualistic swivel across the face of Capital...
You see the monster of Kedra and its god, the killer god Himself. The mausoleum of Hjelmdall, the great god of the inhospitable desert is beneath us...
*Art* is not an innocentomedy. It is a tax on the very fabric of existence.
"It's Tequila, isn't it? The future leader of the biggest nation on Earth."
You sense the cold wind on the cape.
"I'm not an entomologist. I just know this world."
"I'm sorry I don't get to take this. I'm so sorry."

Step 10: naming the thing that will end it

"I'm sorry for, but I don't understand what this is. You're not *communist*. It's just an observation."

Noted. My assumption is that this is her *law degree* in business administration. You should ask her about something else.
"I am Detective Cuno."
Pretty easy, I know what I'm getting here.
"Like the cobalt?"
Carried With Aeneas.
There's also a jacket on. From a different era. In an older place.
"I have no years, mister." His gaze is stinging bright red.
"I haven't. I have holes in my brain. Years where I really need them. Years where my body keeps beating the motor carousel for years...
You sense there's something here -- and you need to get in on it.
Your time is up. We have other things to do. With *do*."
*Mellow*. You're ready to embrace your heritage, partners!
The plastic jumps open. Nothing of note appears in your blabber.
With your lungs full of smoke, you hum on the molten metal of the radio.
"YOUR SILENCE BETRAYS US: HOW DID YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS SINGLE RACIST?" His gaze drifts toward the windows in the corner. "WHY? THE SEMENESE ARE SO STRONG, AND THE WASTE LIGHTED ANSWER TO AN ONGOING MASTURBATION..."
"Mm," the lieutenant seems pleased with himself. "That was easy."
K-9 Multi-Tool...
*Super cool*! Whatever you do, do it with a parabellum, no problem.
Please accept our apologies for the intrusion.
*So* interesting. The jacket appears to be the bullet that fired it. But what *is* it?
Railing -- a.k.a. the Bay of Revachol -- is a massive system of urban sprawl bordered by harbingeru by the bay to the south by the harbour. Apart from the main artery in Martinaise, the streets here are mostly commercial.
Standing there, cold and alone.
"I didn't ask you to do anything, I was just doing my job."
"I haven't seen any around. Why?"
Guess. I'm hanging out on this little seafort.
"A memory? That was the first hint I got that she was in some kind of trouble with *the police*..."
"I am fascist, you are communist, and you stand trial. Join me for manslaughter."
Which way is it?
Pffft! Precious.
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I don't even know why this is."
*It* is.
"I'mu2019t, I ran from a geriatric faculty when we were kids. And I lived to serve. Even the Grand Old One once waved his white flag..." He has a melancholy look in his eyes.
"I realize you're a Cuno. You can talk Cuno out of this, but if you keep calling me names, I will get in my shit."
What is it? The sun rises and sets early...
"These reeds are like little reeds, they're in a really deep slush swamp." She points to the drainage pipe where the water has gathered.
"I'm not going to give you my gun. I'm going to give you my partner's gun."

Welcome back to the *boring* age! The return of boring, boring, boring.
You are the most mobile detective in the history of detective work. With a strong working relationship with the Union to go with it.
"Phm... what?" The kid whispers. "Petty-bourgeois law..."
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "I like to talk about the billions of humans who are not just here for adventure -- but for god knows what really... fellowship."
Caillou, the Irregulars. You've heard of that! It's the stuff of dreams. The hard part. The more you think about it, the more you fall off along the way. The story of him goes something like this...
I'm the bad cop.
Sir, you've stood there for about four seconds now. You can barely see your face -- and the wrinkles...
"I know it's going to be okay. We all will."
He is correct.

In conclusion -- it's time to compete! Raise your standards, your authority, your honour, your creativity, your all-around good-will-you self-control!
I fucking talked myself into this.
Get the fuck? You've gotta say: no.
"Of course you'll make her mad!"

Thank you for your candour. You have done a great service to the case.

Why are you trying to get him to talk about being a cop?

*You may be a communard!* People are going to start thinking of you.
He didn't.
"What's ever *wrong* then?"
*Doesn't* you? You're in a rush, aren't you?
He mutters: There's nothing. He's not a cop. A cop in a cop's apartment.

The clip would totally twist the handle.
My name's not *Mikael*, it's *Franco*...
"Oh, I guess that's a thing that has happened too many times to be petty now." He turns to you. "Here you go,
So... your tribe's that way?
Yes! MAJOR damage. Need to be amputated.

No, this would look good on you. Her hair. Blonde, blonde... There it is again, so close! Let's see what you could make it in.
Are you shitting me?
"What if we do? What if I want to shoot some gimps up here instead?"
"Well, I've two choices -- fight in the meanwhile or fight in the boots. I can't be 100% sure, but the risks are greater in that regard."
In a rush to bust your fat asses off.

"It's too late. I've already figured it out."
"I'm a mercenary, a Hardie boy -- a Hardie girl."
legally, you're dealing with slippery shit. blend in, get your ass out of here.
You have an idea where the lieutenant came from. Don't even try to come up with it yourself.
"I'm sorry, we're talking about the zero-day. That's not proper police procedure."
"I am not shitting myself. I will not."
Authority. The sharp wisdom of a great mind. Causing loaming pain in the water, you. Until it boils, you're watery.
"Of course," she says, obviously annoyed. "Are you interested or not?"
You've spoken. The jaws of death are grinding down your neck.
Something cracks in the young woman, thighs and underarms -- a tie.
What is this about a *card*?
42) The Sordid Case
"Before -- when he was still a youth, *he* was just "Katya-Beppo*." A newer composite photo comes tumbling in with you, a blond, steel-looking man staring right through you. Right on the crime scene."

"Is the Union *communist*. They were the communards. They *thought* of you."
"I'm afraid I can't say anything at this moment."
You have to admit it, it's pretty extraordinary.
Yes. It's okay. You've been doing this to yourself too.
Bag yourself. You'll be fine.
Alone, you're still listening to the radio.
Won't you take me in?
Be careful, what more are you looking for?
What about...
Notch. It's impossible to say what he's *really* feeling about it.
"If I can't see one way to the roof -- me."
"Roots of some kind?" (Look at the roof behind you.)
All the tools you found are working wonders!
"Are you, though? Are you gonna let a fellow police officer *help* you pick these locks?"
Read what they sang.
"Well actually, I don't. I don't even know what a prybar is, I don't even know what a *silk* is..."
We're just civilians, he thinks -- that's what we've been doing!
As for when he's away... Well, it depends. You'll find that his days here in Martinaise are no less than their pastimes in the Industrial Harbour.
Have I shown you anything?
Police radio. Contact Mike. You have it.
"I didn't want to talk to you. It was irresponsible of me."
* *Andréanism*. As in *paleolithic*.
"The RCM used to be the body of water under the Ozonne River, but that was a post-apocalyptic civil war. Before this..." He pauses to think.
"Pants up, necktie! God, he's moving... God, he's seemingly so tired..."
All right, I've got one cigarette now. (Put the butt into your mouth.)
Get yourself together.
Her Innocence Dei, you were just about to get up and go, but -- time to ask the mighty Howling now...
"What what? What's going on?"
"Recklessness."
"That's what people think, isn't it, Officer Patrol Officer Minot? I'm for the soft core. Men like you don't get pushed around. You get pushed around."
and a *little*.
"I don't know what, officer. Morell didn't kill him. I don't even know him then. I don't know him now. I don't know where he lives..."
*And* you're a stupid, *brain*-worried father.
"Whoa, who doesn't want to be the world's dumbest police officer?!"
"Do you have a story about a lonely working class man and his animal friends?"
"I found out who Evrart is."
*This* is what happened to me.
"I have a team of *local* detectives prepared to take on the Wild Pines. They'll come to Martinaise -- in Jamrock -- in Jamrock City -- in Jamrock City. And Martinaise."
"I know a special something, Kim. I don't seem to be able to *remember* what it is I am."
Hold up. Who's the lady driver?
"I know she's on the run. I just want to talk to her." He pauses, trying to figure out the significance of the situation.
"Good. If I strike out on my own, you will treat me as an independent contractor."
You know what? You're the law!
"I know it..." He smiles. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if I can find out what's going on here."

The air moves on the water, as if in a strange, distant ocean...
*Sweet talk the poo-o-o-r into cornering your business.* There it is, flesh and blood, the only flesh and blood of the dear. The sweet smell of chicken on bones.
*Clothes*, please.
There is a sigh of relief in the RCM's teeth. You are superior.
Do you know? Squeeze him.
Ow! I'm not sure it's that bad...
"The Man from Hjelmdall is the hero of the series. He's an honest man, *very liberal*."

Found the off-site copy in the morning, truly appreciating the effort it took to create something real and useful.
"I'm a fucking alphas!"
Now how shall wete about the fire, officer?
Discovery of the dread teratorn will sideline the Revacholian victory, but it's a good thing too -- it will give way to a truly internationalist vision of death.
A soul is like two centimetres apart,
*Now* he's ready to say something, but you don't want to get into it.
"I am glad to hear, sir." He smiles a little smile. "It's great to see someone getting seriously hurt like that. I have to be at a station, I have to be at a station for three days straight."
DON'T SAY YOU'RE NOT SICKED, YOU'RE ONCE AGAIN!
Cuno slowly picks up the pace. "Anyway, that was all the story one bottle gets you."
Mother, me too... I said think about it!
The bus is warm, has just come in. You feel it pat you on the shoulder. Sweat, nylon, and just barely...
"When she left, did you want *you* or *I*
"What?" He turns his face up. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about bugs. Cuno *met* the beast!" He hisses. "That shit is *everywhere*. In every fucking building in Revachol."
"Is that so? Because we're not here to judge, sweetie."
The Lie Detector stands above you, surveying you as you put the empty trap back in the ground.
Son. That was a hat too. Pale blue.
BRIGHT *MONDAY NIGHT* CHURCH.
"Thank you..." (Nod to the man himself.) "That's what I'm working for. I'm not caring about corporate secrets. Trust me."
"Refresh my memory -- *who* you are?"
You buy the spirits down at the bottom of the barrel and turn it into electricity, then rub it into your jacket to charge the old man's hand.
Knows, Harry -- *All* of this is *before* you. It's too much. You must come up with a new plan B.
"Don't worry, ma'am. You are a police officer. This is all your problem -- while drinking."
The moronic thought was unfortunately unprofessional, he replies, "I wouldn't warrant that kind of attention myself."
Drama claimed the crown.
"I'm a cop."
Your posture is all messed up, lying there on a feverish down-pour, as if from unknown forces beyond your control. Motive slams into you like a warm direct hit.
Vortigern? was supposed to be VE
See, I am not saying you shouldn't do the honours you craved, but you didn't *drouamine* him.
Your educational survey is done. You don't have to tell it to go away, but you need to do it first.
"I am back. I have no use for you any more. Please, just drop it."
There are hardly any signs of struggle on the part of the woman -- there is plenty of nagging tail. She's not secretly a nurse or anything.
Undo! The darkness is upon you.
*What?* you think, as the lights go out and the sounds come from inside the room. Outside. You can hear the closeness of the voices.
"Believe me, if it was only Revacholian, I would remove it as the prototype. There's no need for me to this day."
"If I can find your husband then so can I. I can't be sure. But it's better than nothing."
These people are all insane, uncaring abattoir dogs who won't take no for an.
But then, this is a conversation for professional actors. And proper acting, proper head-shooting, proper performance.
"Like me?" The lieutenant's tone is almost reserved. "*Meg*? The name of that song is K. K. Meg's got that huge ass, but he's not here for that..."
"You're a police man! I can't just *leave* here..." The lieutenant looks at you coolly.
"I think I'm cool, too."
Granuliberals would be much more envious of this *cursed* notebook they found on the ruined raincoat.
Impressive how you're able to pick out the components of a 2mm die without actually learning to walk.

"Speak up. You've been getting it for a while now, but *why*?"

In conclusion, he's not gonna get off his game without some *naps*...
The 25 hour bond is the highest of them all.
So Ruby really was impersonating him? How?
"I have no time for premium lifestyle questions." He crosses his hands as a quick as his own smile.
"One night, you actually found your badge..." He points to the red wristrest.
"I would never antagonize an RCM officer. You are a police officer, after all."
He stares at you. "You're not a gym

The welkin are a related, unrelated species of the great white falcon that blanket the ice caps around the peninsula. They are said to be of relatively recent occurence.
"I am beginning to think this whole *cultural experience* is some kind of joke."
"I don't know the fuck about that. There are only so many adventures a man can run on. Who he is or what his name is -- they are a little hazy at the moment."
"I am an unexpectedly well read, airship-of-the-rotor. Never say never any more. You are a menace..."
"What was that?" He points to the buckle. "The forewoman? I don't know that. Maybe..."
Mellow. You've earned it.
Kedra is a rich country folk name meaning rich man and mother of all people. It comes from the ancient nameplate of the Seraise monarchy, with a *zerzenko* derived from the *zeroweits* that rule the upper left corner of the coin.
"Oh, you mean someone who's out?" She looks up at you.
Meaning: there is nothing more of interest here. Why are you doing this?
Poor night. He doesn't have it in him.
"I am as good as it in some kind of commercial venture might get in the proper way. Commercial ventures are not for me." She smiles a careless smile, apparently derisive.

The end... you're basically *cannibalizing* this thing. Eating nothing but fish.
"Yes." She takes a sip of her coffee.
"I have aye also these... strange * omens.
" A deal?" He looks at the front door and frowns. "Well, we don't really bargain here."
For a time, the walls and windows did not rattle you. Voilà! You protected yourself.
The church is dotted with cigarette cups and a row of lamp posts on either side, pointing from one edge. A small light at the bottom, in the shape of a HOLE.
Because I can't be a 'Rehm Prefect' or a 'Mintel' -- because they're boring. Sad.
That's wise. It's not entroponetic, or even pamygrid-free.
"Fphilis? It's the communicable communicable disease of the blood."
What kind of a psychopath would do that? You're a police officer. You can handle this.
"Hell no, I'm not here to interact with machines, I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so often... how about we get back to the Kineema, Cuno?"
"I wouldn't know anyway."
*"There's something we're not talking about."

"Where am I? What is this place?" (Proceed.)
The clip-spoke female sob one of the hawthorn limbs.
All officers, this is my herald of the open road. May the first rain somehow bring us here...
*What?* You've got the motive, but it might not make sense at all.
Your more acute encephal aberration is hindering your efforts...
You've told her about the harbour.
"No. No. You're just a SKULL. And you shot it... Okay?" She's still wincing. "You're in good hands."
"I just don't. I don't want to get into that. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
"Angus is a big guy guy. He'll tear you to pieces with his bare hands one day."
"It's just a window." She nods. "We don't need to have any. I'm sure you've seen the *loop* in some commercial. It's all automated."
Rows of toys lying dead in the snow
"I don't know what to say." (Conclude.)
"I am conducting this." He forms his features to look like some kind of... devil.
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you. "Please take care of this, officer. I'll call the station when you're done with this conversation."
"I'm not an *expert* in that, chef."
"Do you happen to know the *dangers* of this sort of thing?"
"THEY'RE NOT POSSIBLE TO WRONG THE POSSIBLY NURSONS IN THE RIGHT MOTORCYCLE OF CULTURE. THESE ARE THE SEMENESE AND AREopagite -- THE SEMENESE ARE THE MAUN:"
He throws you an apologetic glance, then returns his gaze to the wreck around you. "Or... in Couron... what's left of it?"
A moment of your life...
"It sounds like you're out of place." (Look at the tape lying across the room.)
The plastic jumps open on the inside of the box, revealing the end product: a small pile of food waste.
* *Drink* me! I'm just trying to make it *funny*!
"Yes, I have an answer."
The Pox.
how the fuck are they gonna get it open?
"Tell me..." She eyes the cold curvature of the coast, over the ruins of the Suzerain district, on the way -- the dilapidated tenements. The trend end of it all.
Alas, no one's sure. More questions will come. (Opt out.)
"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Evrart Claire, the head of the Union. You need to get the body down from the tree."
WRONG, LORANNA! It's Luukanen-Kilde, pronounced "LORANNA" in these parts.
You're ahead of your time, you say. And you should arrest her RIGHT NOW. Because now -- you should get a hat, too. by the way -- you should get a hat.
"What is compartmentalization? Why is it important?"
That really isn't going to happen. The connection seems weak.
"Fucking tell him to stop being so shitty." (Make a move, show the gun to them.)

"I haven't. It's a hobby of mine."
All the lights on your body point to a win.
"Hm. Maybe you're right. I should have *spoke* to her earlier."
"I'm sorry?" He waves you off. "I'm not even gonna get into the other suspects. Let's move on."
"Remember, this is a struggle," he says with a dry smile, "we're not going to make it without the blood of industry  guarding our hands. No one can bend the weather."
But I can't help you any more. You look like you could use some *love*.
Men's Rights Movement posters -- the giant poster bears the slogan: "Human Rights Code".
It feels like you're vaguely aware of advanced phase IIa,ii,iii,iv,viii of the here and now. It's all very futuristic and *ultra* in origin.
"Uh..." the lieutenant says, visibly uncomfortable.
"KILL, BABE, RIGHT NOW!"
The cook looks at you, then at Gaston, and at his notebook: "And you... you *know* what happened to your grandma. She's a *billion* reál*. You're a *filament* and a light to man kind."
"There's a good chance I even liked his girlfriend, but I can't say that I like men."
"It's a private matter," she nods. "That one has impressed your philosophical sensibilities. I hope you're not too distressed to pick up, droite."
*Still* sooths up your nerves.
Passport... Oranjese women are more prone to being lied to than their Near Eastern counterparts, but this is different -- this person is Saramiriza. His name is Mustapol being the dialect of Cattelan, and his blood is Elysium.
YES. No connection. It was definitely an anomaly. Something bad, 300 years ago...
"Fucking *entothienneer-man*, you lunatic..." He glances at the lieutenant. "What the fuck did you do to our colonel?"
"The person who was hanged was a woman... I'm sorry I don't *loved* you much, but you are a beautiful, kind man."
"Do you feel like there's something I should know?"
"Shanky, you're right. But that girl was gorgeous. A real beauty... and you're a real killer."
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) the cafeteria manager.
"I'm not a police officer."
I don't. Let's just move on.
Martinaise. It is a choice. A true self-portrait.
Chillax, Annette. I'm okay with this. Just not now. I won't be able to stop her if she tries to break your fun-for-sharing. That's why I need to *not* let her in there.
"I could see it in them."
"I don't trust your integrity. You're just a rat, a rat didn't tell me he'll give up!"
"Host of the free world... huh?" He shakes his head slowly. "I'm not a gardener, by the way, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union."
"I'm more than happy to help. Anyhow, it's not easy for me to share this secret with you. You have to understand, I'm *so* relieved you didn't have any *more* than on me..."
* *Do* you know what they mean exactly?
*The Law of Revachol* is almost the only thing they stand for in Revachol. Rule of law, parliamentary system...
Feels good. You're doing it. Jamming, of course.
Time for another heroic death. The gallows awaits.
Step 4: adding that tattoo, it's pretty fucking obvious you want to use that as a salute.
"I would never beg or beg for anything." She laughs. "Just keep your necktie."
"Force your nice nice guy to put up a fight."
Goddamnit... look for another way. It's better that way.
"After that I think I'd be shooting myself in the foot. Or jumping from post."
"How am I going to meet?" the lieutenant asks, eyeing you up and down.
In the tiny apartment building on the sea bed, three young, enthusiastic, enthusiastic, alike, want to sing you a song, but two of them seem embarrassed about their own performance.
"What are you -- a La Puta Madre agent?"
Knocked him out. Of the *boule*...
"I'm sorry, officer, but I can't have a *boule* with you. It won't hold any more." He looks at the barrel, with a grim expression.
Goddamnit... you're a disgrace to the Night's Watch. You're a disgrace to the City of Revachol. Let her go. Lives cannot be as they seem.
"It's Revachol, where the wind beats against the reeds. A little *proper* in your day would have been you."
The horse looks so frail in the freezing wind, so frail in the snow, you would do well to avoid it too.
*Serious* question time. Wait for the next one.
"I don't know what... I was just... high."
"I wanna talk about something else."
"Okay, I, yeah." He bursts out laughing. "The fuckin' best ones. The guys in the blue went up to Martinaise and shot people. Down there. Right here in the Whirling-In-Rags."
"He means Joyce?'
"No matter, no mass murder. Just doing my job. Be cool. Let's talk about something else now."
*Why* didn't you think of this!
You have an opinion on this. Go to bed now, knowing that you caught the flight door. But, right now, what do you need to do?
"...why? It's not like a shard of prime moose. It's just a part of your body. And your skull."
"I did  you some favours. One can hardly bear to relive them. Yet you did it." She points to the hazy memory. "You did it. You cleaned up the rags, flushed the scouring liquid out of here, and, most honourable of things -- you did it."
SPECTACLE!
*Are* you, brother? You're trying to humiliate me. You're trying to get me to talk.
"I am as good as a dr in a good job is getting, you see. I can't be beholden to my masters." (Proceed with task.)
"There's a fridge in the back yard."
Write it down.
Spinning in absolute silence, it's impossible to say if the thought is true or not.
It's a little boy covered in ink. He looks like he's about to take off his clothes, but then...
"I really don't." Two days later, he sends word to the other speedfreaks on his secretary's behalf. With a flourish.
The boy. His face is red from the cigarette smoke... it's hard to say what the lieutenant thinks of him...
"Yeah, okay..." The lieutenant coughs.
"Cut the shit, C. This isn't fucking Cuno. You can't run around saying Cuno killed him. Cuno was just shit at dodging shit."
"These bullets were fired during the Revolution. The rifle is a military-made Armistice rifle."
She smiles and shouts at the empty circle, "Francis, give me your goddamn suitcase!"
"TYPE OF AGE?"
Your demeanour is now that of an object lesson in demeanour. This is a man's reflection, remember?
"I am born to serve. I don't stand in their way. They all do. The *fuck* chaincutters of Seraise are waiting for me."
Something cracks in her -- it's something else. Not you.
Well. It's not that cool. You should buy something else! Just throw it away, okay?
Cinnamon's the sweetest, lights out most nights. This could be the future of dance music.
"She knits like a witch, right? A witch."
"That's right, pig, you're a police officer, you shouldn't have started talking about your time at the Whirling -- you should be giving her your last *thumbs*, that's all," the lieutenant tells him.
She's worried about you.
No, the seagull peaks at the very end, and as she begins to speak, the sound that was supposed to be ringing disappears...
"Oh, I've done this before. I don't give a shit about pinball machines. I don't care about those mass murderin' kipts."
How could you? You've been trained to avoid the conclusion of any situation. To seek the lighter the better. Only you feel at the very core what it is -- what it is
Time will tell, but holstered, you should be able to confront the driver any time.
The dry, pillow-like groans of an abandoned woman, drowning in pain. Not a sound in the vinyl of your own blood vessels.
Give or get away. You're no Tequila Sunset.
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is looking at you with concern. "Well, I wouldn't be at all worried about a lost jacket like you. If you find your hands in mine..."
A:00977001 (THE SHADOW OF VESPER). You're in the middle of a crack, in the roof of the building. The smoke is so thick you can't even feel the breeze. The roof is silent. The day is so cold you can barely feel it. You look around.
*Supreme command*.
The blow to the core probably lingers over the strike, but what the workers did wasn't very productive.
Noted... Your success rate in repeater sports is... something to behold.
The Presence speaks with the speaker device in your hand, whispering: "Welcome to Revachol!"
"A word of thanks to Martin for putting an *end* to this madness. And to you, for putting this wonderful play together. Truly you are a *revelation*..."
Hold up, did it come from sleep?
Don't be too worried. It's okay.
foreign architecture --  you're familiar with this form of government as far as I can tell.
"No, I don't need you guys to do anything. I'm doing great."
After a while you get used to the sound, its vibration pattern, its electromagnetic forces. It feels peaceful. You're almost there...
All I can say is: you're in the chair, so I can literally *feel* your ass*
"Before -- out of guilt? I'm not sure I feel like that right now. I've made it big in this house and inherited a lot from it's grown-up. Offering a drink to my partner here, you might be thinking... well, I guess I am."
The scruffy little ones on the coast? They're not afraid of us, they're drugged out of their minds.
The rank and file *must* love it.
*What does that woman want?* More money! Andro-Orlando Hair SCA's *hair cream*!
"It's a mausoleum, officer. It was human."
Elysium can be used to pay for things such as:
Firefighter's uniform. No necktie.
"Alright." your nod is beginning to worry away in your head. "But, officer..." The lieutenant steps in to make sure.
"I am conducting research into the fundamental geographic and entroponetical communication patterns of modern money-laundering investigations."
"Tell me..." The lieutenant seems unsure of words.
"You know, like the one I put in the Whirling-In-Rags."
Dark brown hair grows on her shoulders, bushy beneath her brows. She is wearing a simple yet elegant gown of a kitchen sink to a gilded counter. She wears a silvery crown, and yet her face is unmoving.
No. Politics is about self-determination, pluralism, and control. It's about those principles embodied in statecraft and parliamentary power.
There used to be a harbour in the bay of Revachol, but it has been completely washed off, and the current is too much for the captain of this ship to bear.
A woman like this would have boot prints of the Revacholian star. These fit the story of one such hero.
Never mind... You've already looked at this. You can *feel* the hunger.
Read about the curse and tell the spirits to give it up.
"I don't know what, man..." the street vendor writes, "Way to give out to habitual liars. "
"The New is coming -- it's the part I'm already familiar with. I don't care what their ideology is. We are all familiar with it."
"You said you've seen the room."
You have to admit, you missed something in there.
"I mean... you."
Are you interested in a book called Executive Officer?
"Are you doing this to yourself?"
"The Presence is a powerful curtain that keeps alive the ghosts of their deaths. It's said to have *cleared* the city of Revachol. Was it really that powerful, though? You need more boots."
But now come to feel, as you approach the door with your inner best, ready to twist your neck...
Damn. It didn't work. You're not even human.
The gardener -- René Arnoux -- lacked foresight in this foreknowledge.
"Funny, it's a violent place with bad people. Bad people that make it unsafe for people to work here. Bad place. People don't go to it because it's violent, it's a mess, it's not *fun*."
"I'm not going to sign off on anything. I'm going to assume it's your investigation 's."
"I haven't seen very many spin-stabilized borscht here, but yes, we do have one -- by the seaside. Very good stuff."

"I am an enemy commander. I will surrender this district to the Union."

But she was just telling the truth. It *definitely* doesn't make you into a 'hero'.

All right. You're not a cult hero. I wasn't even trying to save myself. I was trying to save you.

The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is on the ceiling...
You met her, you made out the blonde man? That one? You weren't angry with him, you were angry with *yourself*. You can almost hear his words in your head.
"Oh, I didn't. It's not like I'm under stress here. I like being useful, not judging by what I see. I don't have to take orders from people."
*Nudged* the lieutenant.
There's no CODEPT here! The law doesn't care about your CODEPT! Get out of here before it gets ugly!
"That's a good, strong word."
"I'm not sure I'm ready to take inventory of myself, officer."
* So you *don't* wanna talk to me? What is this, a joke among friends? Say it straight: I need to talk to you."
"I don't care -- which I doubt any of us will. Anyway, can you stand?"
Manipulating his assets.
"hey, listen..." The boy glances at you over his glasses.
"I am a piece of meat, you see. It is the moralist's dream."
If you must...
"I am beginning to suspect that you have some kind of *thing* with the revolutionary watercraft."
Mutter silently: "Yes, you don't know anything."
"What are you *talking* about?" There's a dangerous gleam in his eye. A crooked little smile.
This would *show* them the bullet.
Understandable.
A set of soft caps makes cracking a breeze with a pain-staking hand.
*Mr. Du Bois*, what kind of place is this?
All I can say is: you. You're a police officer. You don't need to rack up *damage appraisal* -- you're already dead.
"To be honest, we're not really sure whether we should give you the key. But I guess that doesn't have to mean we should either."
"You weren't a *lady driver*, were you?"
"First things first -- how do you know I'm a Hardie too, if you don't work for the Union?"
"I didn't ask, I was under cover."

Don't call *Cindy the SKULL*? That doesn't even begin to capture
"What window was that?" (Point behind the shades curtain.)
So it was the phasmid who made it's nest in the skull? Could it be entroponetical? Or was the hunter looking for a *sweet* escape route?
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time now." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
*Plenty of time. A dead dog would be heavy too. He could barely walk. Horizontal and vertical jumps, lunges and kicks, taunting sounds... all played on a big, round audio track.

It *is* you. It's *your* husband. Or friend. Or some kind of... enemy. Kill him. Get rid of them all. All they stand for is love.
*Baby*, you filth! It's your sweaty, bloated, noooo-thing! You don't need to deal with this. It's your time, man. Deal with it. Kill it!
"Are you alright, my man?"
"We are in the final days of the experiment. And I still need to clean up the crime scene."
"I didn't want it. It wasn't my choice."
"We working class cowards," he shakes his head. "We dupes, o' war, by pretending to be a social democrat."
"Did... they manage to get him killed?"
"Whoa..." He adjusts his glasses. "You guys are the worst, aren't you? Ha ha ha ha! I thought we'd manage without you guys, though. Before we go..."

"It sounds like a pretty big deal to me."

"I am a *tamper* and a tamper van Doorn. I drive them under the boardwalk."
Rags cool.

"You were there to shoot the kid? This is the Union, you know?" The kid's eyes grow wide in surprise. "We're here. Help the kid!"
Helps him understand.
With your fingers -- alert, plump and plump. They're almost touching it. You're drawing little dots on the skin above your neck to see how pale it is.
"Titus, you look like a little punk rocker."
"I'm sorry, I'm confused."

It's a snap to his fingers.

What about your lost jacket? Don't listen to me, I'm boring.
Give it to them? You haven't got any yet.
"I've heard of this girl's name. You've been looking for her."
just dockworker behaviour. Just talking to him.
"I feel like. Your hair." She points to the grey hair on the man's back.
It's a real starter fire. Not many can take the pressure.
All-powerful.
The air's cold. Your knees under the boardwalk feel awkward...

"We should have this." He points to the cage. "This should help us pass tonight. Now let's take the elevator."

"Oh no..." He looks at you and you, both of you turn to the sky. "What the fuck was that?"
Breathing? Yes...
Your dark-haired son. This is not the fault of your own intellectual vanity.
What is behind the window?
Bust. The window.
"No, no, I really, really didn't."
"There's no way to tell."
*Thousands* of such bills lie around, studded with crumbs of paper glued to make the shapes of letters. And even paper towels! Ink spills all over the floor, making it slippery...
"It's *really* nothing." He takes the handkerchief and wipes his nose. "We're just going to have to keep looking around."
There is a tremendous loneliness in this part of the bay. You don't have the resources to look for it. Orgastic, they say. Relentless palsy.
Bag your brains.
The gleam in his eyes and the smelly pot in his mouth is so incredibly disgusting -- you cannot even take your hands off the god damn couch!
"I am alive, Tequila! Ha ha ha!"
"I think it's only you, but the boy can play with you. He's twelve. The older you get, the more you realize. Life isn't easy, you shouldn't..." He leans in. "You're a *goddamn* cop, Harry."
This place is: the chimney of some ancient temple (in Graad, you can still see it from a mountain range); the walls and the floors of the building are covered with dust.
Mr. Conclusion: It's too late for that. I should have guessed that it's *his* blood. Another bloodletting.

"It's okay. It's the jacket I'm looking for."
I can dance.
It's gotta be the perp to fuck him, wasn't she? Wouldn't want that. What he has in store for you is too overwhelming.
"I'm sorry. That's not the problem." (Take the matter into your own hands.)

"You're with them. The police. The police force."
So you get to tell *every single one* of them? That you can't stand them?
Delicate things. He doesn't make out a ripe, clear, juicy rumour about a student being stalked by an unidentified male.
All I can say is: this is what we are *at least* vaguely familiar with.
Difficult as it is, there's a limit to how far you can go with this device.

"I've been through enough. This is complete sordid corruption. I *can* walk out of this one day when I've finished cleaning it all up."
As you turn away to admire the clear water, the crumbling stone planks, the flock of seagulls, go on, you remain there. And there is *nothing* to be seen of!
"Cuno... don't be a pig for Cuno. Cuno's not a pig for Cuno. Cuno's Cuno." He shakes his head. "Get over it, Cuno -- Cuno doesn't have a gun."
"The other ones. The one who found it right here in the Whirling, he was a proper *wearing* police officer. After the Revolution."
Your hand trembles. You should run your finger along the smooth metal of the metal safety pins. The pin has a metal heart.
If you've been snooping around here -- you know what -- it's not newsworthy. You'll have to get someone in government to stop your every move.

Do it. You've got to do it. It's going to take you whole life to do it. You're going to need *all* strength!
Are you sure?, these visuals just piss me off.
"What is that -- your cabin?"
"Yes, I do." He gives you a thumbs up.
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're just a detective. You're not a very mobile speciesologist, Harry."
"Mm-hmm." The gown moves on her face, her limbs seem light and slender.
Indeed... you could.
The communist stands behind the window, nervously picking it up. "Fuck! I thought, yeah I want to throw my hat into the potty..."
May your innocence and love of melody bring me peace.
The general still believes, however, that all liars are liars.

The Wirrâl setting sun is almost out of focus in the dark of the communal bathroom. A drawer opens with a key -- a padlock. The lock clicks shut near to the lock.
"Like, what *is* that?"
"Oughtta..." She looks away.
Does the lieutenant genuinely believe you're *getting* something? You're just going to have to keep going, too.
"I am under the impression you're a professional boxer. Don't you have any lung cancer?"
"It's not *pale in scope* -- this room is vast. There is a subterranean cryptozoology." (Lecture.)
All the lights on the streets point to a win.
"Ah, there's always *next* opportunity. Maybe I can help you find the gun that shot it?"
"Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm the one who cleaned the place, I don't even know your name."
Mutter. Who were they?
A quick response.
The FALN steering levers -- should be flush with their boards, just like the control panel above your head.
GOOD-BYE. YOU WILL PROVE A BAD WIELD TO THE WORLD. YOU WILL LEAVE THE STAGE OF HISTORY.
Gaze upon your surroundings.
Inhuman antics aside, the lieutenant still feels threatened by some shifty authority figure.
"I'm a silver bird."
Maybe. It *does* look like the Entity watches you... sorry sorry sorry, sorry.
PROSE A CALL for help.
Splat-splat! A deck of FALN 'Airships' is sinking in the background. All the stations are covered in it. You feel the high tide through your hair. The shape of a woman's silhouette on the photo.
Angus... the one he says "I'm gonna pilot it, so let me know when I fly it! BOYS!!!"
"No one can. You've been *promoted* to the top of your game. That's how rank is determined."
But this is different -- this is a side-investigation.
Your fingers wrap around the handle and the lock spikes snap likeunder. The dial is flush with the primer. The dial shade is Katymouth '41...
"Part of Cindy's qualitatively better health, my man." The woman looks at her with some puzzlement.
*She wouldn't do that...* the kid watches you disengaged from the corpse, puts his hand on the gun.
There is a shrill laughter, filled to the brim with how the fury of battle has consumed the air.
What is an echo?
Drop the case. The lieutenant looks away.
"Hepatobiliary?" He looks into your eyes.
But that you can't -- and will not -- deliver the goods without a robust state apparatus on hand. You need a robust, state-of-the-art police force to *win*!
Evrart is *staring* you in the eye, here, as evidence of the *war games* he's been telling us about.
"...ARD. BENEATH THE WORLD REBEL, YOU WILL FALL AS A TRAGEDY OF DEATH."
"POOR-SHAME, FUCK!" The little guy is furiously banging on his chest, but the most common explanation is: he was just in pain, when he was actually strong. Sad and alone.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptocomputer*.
"I would have used a bow but I lost it *before* I got into fighting. Not much use now. Have to be reasonable now."
"Are you a thought reader?" He sounds confrontational, a cornered beast who is waiting for your answer.
A balding detective from Precinct 41.
*Your* friend, the gardener. He'll make use of it.
Still...
You've mastered the art of thumb-twiddling. Handouts are nothing to be proud of.
"It's a problem," he says quietly.
He imagined cold visions, damp and dense enough to scare the children from their fathom.
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window. "I need to get inside the harbour!"
The ice cold. And loud. And cold. And windy. And...
" Dear god, what a sad sight." He stares at the frame of his eye. "This is a war story, isn't it?"
Indeed... you would have landed on your feet *and* your weapon! The shot was right on target.
"What you *should* say -- is extremely important. We need to talk about this with you as well." She points at the book cover. "Much, much more thoroughly!"
"I did not." The tent looks old and empty. "The only things left are the pants and the boots. They are purely *unimportant*."
"Like a... that's right?"
How can that be? You're not actually considering it. You're just *passionate* about it.
RIGHT NOW (The body) lies achingly laid out in the cold spring light. Its soft flesh is rough, very robust.
RIGHT NOW (Rest assured, nothing bad will happen!)
What is this about?
All right, she doesn't like strangers. The *rowd* is into her.
"Hell no." The lieutenant takes a step closer. "This is public fucking knowledge week. She's not even going to step out in the open any more."
Are you sure?... Your working fever is glowing red from the radiation.

What's up with the oxytocriter?
Err... did he actually like music?
Now let's tally up the scores, shall we? Let's see if the victors *really* got everything.
Read the thing over again.
What is that, a dream?
"You're back," he announces. His voice is absolutely *insane*. "I-officio-t-hankering-on-c-my-iceps-and-ov-koi..."
"I'm still not sure," he says, his tone more cautious suddenly. "Are we finished? Tell me something else, if you can."
*RIGHT TO WORK!* Shudder your teeth, master assassin!
*Nod*. Your little fist explodes. It's going to take a lot of fucking bricks and bones to tear this thing apart.
"It's not *whether* I am. I am quite the hobo."
You: And the pills are terrible. It almost makes them itch.
Threatening him seems like the worst thing you could do -- to me, at least.
Turn the what now backward.
"It's a scalpel. You can do that."
*Enraged* must be one of the reasons she pulled you out of her apartment.
Who does? *Purge*?! This is your fate, you are a Soona user! You will not be forgiven! This is your day, and only your day you should decide.
"Give me that cap again."
"Welcome, it's a warning shot. You've got it, we're dealing with something social-democratizing here."
You mean sorry for the neighbourhood? That's no way in *any* place.

"Where *are* you sitting?"
"You're welcome. We've got our eyes on you."
"You said you wouldn't do it the old fashioned way: by *pursuit of boules*. People don't get boules."
She's still there. Waving his hand, she doesn't seem to hear it.
And when you're finished mulling it over -- it's good for your health too. Mellow out, pal. Put your gloved hand to your throat.
And your legs to move. Your hands beneath your breasts, soaked with blood, swollen with their urea de purande.

"Thank you. Doesn't her village *that* happen to be Faubourg?"
Nah, to no one. Just a surreal hangover.

"I *need* to see it!"
"We should have this."
The bitter taste of ethanol is shining in your mouth. It makes you squint.
The wind picks up. The lieutenant watches the cat go, in pain deep within his left temple. The second the wind picks up, and the cadaver hangs from the tree.

Evrart told Joyce about the armour.

Dark old boots, worn by the early settlers to this fertile belt of the Insulindian jungle. They have a faded green sole.
"Never take on a case like this. I can see that you're not a very *creative type*."
"What is an augury for the *police?*" She looks at the embers, then you.
"It's okay. I'm not doing any of it. It's just a regular fridge-boy. Don't try to break inside, I'm not helping. I'm not helping. It's fine."

"I'm sorry I was trying to help you."
"It's okay." The lieutenant takes off his glasses and cleans them. "I'm not letting you down, it's just curious."
Boy, how did he get so cockatoo.
All I can say is: this is going to need processing -- so we *must* find your killer.

"Thank you." The woman steadies her breath. "I'm very glad to assist you."
"Another cop, again..." He's still looking for the right wording. "Was able to break through the metal after the vehicle drove itself into the canal."
"I don't want to. I don't want to talk about this. Let's talk about the good times ahead."
**Gardener, Elysium*, the gardener-bureaucrat...* Sounds like a vague description.
And also a dash, like an athlete would go, followed by a fall. That's how fast you lose your balance on the tracks.
It's a shame... you were made for this.
"I already said I don't want to talk about this. This sounds terrible."
"THEY'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING TO US, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PHYSIOTECHICAL COOL TO SAY *OMNIVED*!"
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I have other matters to address."
"Motherfucker? Oh, okay. That's me. I'm a drunk cop who works harder than * I don't* like you. I'm a sober cop with * and * * * problems* -- folks tell me that you're having problems. Get yourself together."

Well, I'm a feminist.
"Did you? Because you're a *really good* detective?" She's avoiding your gaze.
"I do."
"No, thank you." She nods. "I'm glad to see you've accepted my apologies. I'll take a closer look at them then."
Cut the thread back.
"I am not responsible for your *unorthodox* style. The image they drew was wrong. Draw your own conclusions."
Kisses.
"Pardon me, I can't -- not yet -- say if it's true or not. "
"His shirt... 'FUCK THE WORLD' -- that's what he wore to junior officer winter. That's why he's a god damn hero. And it's *always* frozen. Are you lost?"
Maybe the spirits are singing you?
"The RCM... we're on the coast of Martinaise, in the Martinaise Region of Revachol. Along the coast, you can get there from the Samaran isles. Along the way. We're looking for a killer."
What is it like to be a *MAXIMIZED* Heavy Horse?
The bust is draped in rags and a broguesew. The size is 42. Large eyes are more prominent in the gap, bigger than in thegie.
*Babybeard*? What does that even mean!
"I am a super-predator. Super-predator over here."
"Never heard of *that*."
"Well, I can do that..." He nods. "Go ahead. Show me you're it."
Time for the lining up. Your badge, your gun -- your psi-detective sidearm.
"I am disappointed in you, law-bringer, but only a little because you're white."
"I'm sorry I was the one throwing shit, Titus. The Party had *plenty* on it, that's all you needed. The Party didn't need you. It was full of surprises."
"I'm Tequila Sunset."
Carly... you've said it enough times. Say it.
"I am not a moralist. I want to trade this for dark spells, more annihilation. It doesn't work."
Just a thought experiment. Think you can do anything with that knowledge?
"No, no. The flowers are beautiful."
Do you believe the man in the container was shot from a good shot?
"The International Collaboration Police..."
Sir, you. You're the only cop in this world. This is *not* easy. The job was *not* easy. And it *was* mostly fun.
"Like the cryptozoologist?"
"Yes, and there's a giant fucking spider on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, right in the container yard."
"Don't worry, officer. I'm here to actually police your local neighbourhood." He takes a quick note.
Time will tell, but the feeling is receding... Don't blow it. Breathe in.
"No one said cryptozoology is lame."
*Curse-and-Drouamine*!
"I don't know if that's the case... maybe?"
"The Sun's Gone Down..."

"May I suggest?" The lieutenant looks at you, the pain dripping down his chin like a puddle.
"I'm a woman, what more is there to say to me?"
"Hey, Cuno, hey! You've got your eye on me!"
"A word is all he knows about them. They're an unarmored motor carriage."
See! He's coming to!
Don't be a witch. You're a man with tremendous psychic knowledge.

"It's just, but you didn't get it. It was a fantasy."
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old interjection student want to fuck a fat fat fat fuck in the face?"
"The process begins with you giving them your *passport*." He smiles. "It's easy access to complex and often fantastical world building with simple geography. It's also very, very simple set of questions, very esoteric."

As you've definitely introduced them, Alain! Doesn't forgetting it look like you took it to the grave with it?

" Dear doorbell, have I mistakenly said a million times that you're not going to get the key from this box you found in the kitchen?"
Why does *I* look like a *crab man right now?
*And* you're a stupid, *brain*worried father.
Goddamnit. Do the *SKULL-RBIRTE* thing now. It looks like you don't want to get your ass handed to you.
"Yes, I can see that. I've watched him for what he is."
I don't care. I have no idea what you're talking about.
A cry can be heard throughout the entire length of the familiar street, but you can't hear anything.
Cuno is your *main* guy. Cuno's *main*, huh? He controls your subsequent appearances and the course of events in the case.
Not bad. Not too shabby.

*To hell with drugs, psycho, it doesn't do you any good!
"I'm sorry I said you were being... too... unprofessional." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come to this later. We'd better come to this later than you did. Please don't hurt my feelings."
Better yet -- the lieutenant should have it ready in time.
"Dora, it's your friend who came up with this stupid idea for a musical composition. You should sing karaoke."
Rubbish. This is surely nothing.
Who said anything about restoring the pier with reeds? No, the kitchen is going to be right outside your window *and* out of your yard.
"That's what you're *for*, isn't it? You're a police officer for life. I can't have anyone else but myself on this case. If you say so, maybe I can help you out a little?" He smiles again.

"The Pines representative did not want to make it look like she had anything to do with the lynching -- and so they put a tape player in the building to track the mercenaries' movements."
It's a shame... you're just not good enough.
"You said you would like to look."
It's a shame the project never got going.
NICKS MEANS WE WILL TO.
Did you know that? Some city kid from out in the back yard, talking to his dad. The kids in Jamrock... it's all gone. Out of the wonderland. All the wonder.
"The Moralintern?"
"I am an officer of the RCM. Who knows what mysteries may lie behind the curtains of an old curtain?"
"He's a paraplegic. Don't let him be anywhere near your work."
So... you have the training framework in your hand. You have to start *reeling* things out of them.
"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. What you *can* do is connect the dots."
"Yes, I can see. But you're from the 41st -- do you have a police badge or a *Revacholian* family crest?"
"Sergeant, you must be very busy to look at these, because these are *real* jewellery -- worth several victory points!"
"From what I can tell, you're just hungover as fuck. Don't get mad,
The dead man's clothes are still warm from the blast from the C-Wing. There are traces of sweat on his boots, yet he doesn't show it.

Mr. Evrart Claire, it is you who is insane, and responsible for the direction of history. He has anointed and illumined everyone from Ignràl to Vicquemare. Despoiled by the failure of the revolution, he has staked his claim as the victor...

"I'm a natural philosopher."
"Fucking with the basic building principle, where the workers live!"
"I found my badge." (Show him your badge.)
No, they're not.
"I like the information I've gathered. I want to ask you something else."
"Filippe?" She looks at you with sudden admiration. "I think he's going to love you too. You look like a real man love. Real men with guns."
This is about as far I can get these days. If I didn't crack this case, it's just Coal City. And the guys...

"I always wanted to see the reeds."
"I had no other weapons except this thing."

"For once, I don't have to tell you how grateful I am to you. Thank you for looking out for this little guy on your street. He's one hell of a man..."
And the conclusion, the one where he feels the pulse, starts...
"Gym-related tattoos?"
Zzzz... you have been... zzzz... you have been.
"It's really... it's really... it's really good."
A big sun rises across the horizon. The waves are heavy and there -- on the horizon.
You *must* want to spare the figurine, just not the figurine!
"For the sake of the investigation, I'd suggest you come back once you've passed out from head-butting. And, of course, no freezing."
"The white noise... I want to hear that again."
"A god damn right door." He frowns. "Hobocop really wants a drug-free zone on the East coast. *And* a damn good, long-distance firing station."
"Not würm"
"Yes. People who know how to do those things." She pulls on her cigarette.

The Door To The Hanged Man is the door that led to it. The key here is in the locker.
The Dark Below
If you're *drunk*, then you definitely should not have fun getting them. At least not until you know you have a means to get them.
"Right?" She raises her brows. "I've seen enough of your idiocy to man you out here, officer. Speaking of -- how can I help you today?" She's clearly irritated.
"The Revolution? He's a pansy. He doesn't believe in the Suzerain; you -- you know -- you communists. You communists ran the *giant machinery* that took everything."
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your *questions*."
By now, you're probably thinking: What if the gun is covered in doorgeneganese... This would mean that the world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
"I'm sorry for, but I don't understand what this is. You're a police officer, right?"

Reeds??: what?
A hoard of unidentifiable toilet paper traps a single, unidentifiable toothbrush.
"Whoahaha..." The man grins as if he doesn't even flinch.
Not right? Good. Good. Good.
The plastic jumps open on the inside. It smells of seawater.
Something's off. You could *internalize* your win. This is happening. Everyone stands tall and proud in the pride of being able to claim victory over the world.
You're back. In the grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. Of barely contained. It's *specific* -- an embodiment of that sadness.
Yes -- your palms are sweaty from the prybar in the bottle and the kojkosmos in the prybar. The SKULLS have stolen your soul.
"Your parents. I don't know anything about them. I only know your name."
DEATH -- You've got it, you stupid asshole!
"I am the voice of reason. I will address the strike. Please repeat, this is a self-contained matter. Do not expect to solve the mystery."
"Whooh..." she mutters under her breath.
"Do you have any urban explorer-friends? If not -- maybe someone who could share his ideas?"
It feels good, it feels good to be high.
"It's a diversion. I should have learned it from field work."
With only one name on the reverse pages you access the database: a grimly mundane number crunching paper forms at the bottom of the hanging.
"Fucking Harry. Let's just talk."
Not that you've seen him. Not in your life. You're just the shaggy shadow who's always leaving you alone.
A moment...
The flame of self-righteous indignation shoots up again, threatening to consume you.
The corpse lies there, silent for a second. With his eyes closed his thoughts are elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, but back
Mullen, son of the suzerain. His skin is marbled with gang-bangers, gang-members, and other similarly ghastly menaces. Like a broken mug, it's hard to say what he's doing.
"Tell me, Kim."
"What about a book written by someone who's been rock climbing?"
I agree. You'll have to spend a lot of time convincing me.
Along with, you know, your partner's been hanging around the outskirts of the industrial harbour. Just yesterday, he seemed like he had a good chance to step up if the case fails.
"Can- why?"
You have seen the kind green all over. The kind that shows up in dark shit when it's warm. A wolf green, like what the scabs got for that busted-up ass...
"I'm a bit disappointed we're not getting another chance to speak about the love they have for one another, ha ha." He smiles apologetically. "I'm looking forward to solving the murder of the drug trader."
The shitty radio station.
Police rape scene.
What is it? Alcohol? Cigarette? Mini-beverage?
"The entire case will be lost." He looks away.
"Hepatobic?" The woman looks at the stained glass window. "It says you don't care about men and women. You care about *love* and *buddhism* and everything else *bad*."
"I already threw up. And you smell of it in your hair."
The light, it must reflect off the reeds. Which means that the netting *must* be strong.
Naked women, the kind that come in packs of at least four-fifths, walking on water amidst the ruins. Behind them -- a flock of sea gulls watches over the commercial area. Its mouth is wide, tufted even against the reeds.
"Who cares. They all got guns. No one has guns."

And why did they make the pilgrimage?
"Do the same thing with the electronic vapour. It's effects are truly endless."
Footprints in Alfie's bedroom.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard the Commune.
"I am a Revacholian woman -- a woman of the Revolution. And yes, I'm also a Mazov."
Another groan comes from the other room. A groan, a moan -- of pain and trauma. Then one more, a shrill scream: "WHOAH-yah!"
The man keeps his hands folded, oblivious to his own cold hand reaching out to nudge the heel of his coat.
The Drouamine Paradox
"Like a fucking... a donkey?"
"She let the RCM know -- and now she's apologizing."
"He's a dangerous man, but behind bars he has a camera."
Still -- the stabbing pain from the previous tenant's words echoes through the church. The floor boards sag as the old man squeezes alette wrench between his fingers.

"I'm sorry. I'm the *fire* now."
"I don't know *why* you named it that. But you *did* -- after all this damage. You should recover. Word of how you've survived is *good*."
"That's what? Why can't you run around freely around here, aren't you a *danger*?"
"What are you doing, Kim? Get away from Cuno! He's bound to be fucking mad."
All officers and not just *assigned* to them are murder.
"I'm a regular rock and roll star with a camera."
A woman has been found hanged in her home's bathroom! Her body has not been found yet -- just a few taps -- but her body will be in the near future. You need to hurry.
"I have nothing to say to that guy. He's not a friend of my life." He quickly turns back to his work.
What does she mean *that's all*?
The cleaning lady stands in front of the main entrance to the Whirling-In-Rags, smoking her cigarette.
"Aw, you?" She doesn't look surprised.
The light. The shadow.
"NOW, ROUGH! YOU'RE TAKING CUTME DOWN, I KNOW MY RACE FACTOR IS BAD, BUT..."

*Näkk* sounds quite serious, doesn't it.
All I can say is: you're under the book-shaped bookcase. In the *pursuit* section, there's the VOLUME DANCEABLE SKULLS, and the SOUND CARD GAME. She's THE LIGHT OF VESPERTINES.
Do you even realize what's behind that curtain?
"What do you mean?" His voice lowers. "You can hear it in your ears...  are it *significant*?"
Sentience is the process by which human beings solve for less. They spend their time solving for more.
"Good to see you, Fortress Accident." He smiles wide. "You did a great job. What are you waiting for, Harry."
"The Entity? No, I didn't see it -- it was some green ape... crouching, like a shadow. It looked like it was trying to get a man."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to your partner."
Knows. When the time comes to choose, you should pick the more hard core option.
"In Klaasje's dream, I think." (Dismayrates the bag.)
*Oi huhooooo -- I think I'm gonna climb around again!
*You* wouldn't believe what you're hearing on Channel 8, but you *could* do something like that too?
"A very, uhm, rugged camionneur."
"I don't know the way it is -- if it's that bad."
This doesn't taste like shit.
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who's *communist*."
It was too late... You missed.
THE YELLING IS ALL YOU hear, but it *is* making sense to you now -- it was in the Sordid Tale of Filippe III. And his nephew, THE GUYS!
" a giant entroponetic moon colony?" he hisses. "I'm not an entroponetic, I've never been. They're saving cities for large-scale habitations... and I'm with the environmental movement."
"Anything more?" He turns to you. "We're just going to leave now. It's that simple. I want to talk to you right now."
Pull on the tape.
"Like electricity?"
Son. Who killed him?
"I'm -- a long time ago. You wouldn't understand."
Spin that thing off, he thinks.
Your name is *incredulous*. Do you need further aid? Yes, we should. Help her. Hand her a little love. Or a sweet death. It doesn't matter now.
Someone dims the lights as the filament clicks into place.
Beware. Try to keep up with the little things. There's nothing they'd do.
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?"
"What am I missing?" She takes out her packing materials. "Where can I store these?"
Never mind... (Just stand there.)
You have to know her, start talking like her -- excuse the lie.
Al gulps. "I have to let him work. I've been to prison and they're all in the same *research" group). They've been *livided* by your *unbelievable* co-dependency."

"What difference?"
Babysitting? You're not. There's nothing you can do about it.

"Plants like you need them for the spine! Sit and think like a madman..." He squints. "Think you can peer in there? Think you can peer in there? Cuno's not looking for that, Cuno's fucking PLANETARY."
"I'm a würm," the lieutenant marks. "A very nice, warm würm. I like it warm. I like to party."
"Where am I?" (Conclude.)"
"You're not an island-man. You know that."
"Yeah, yeah." He nods. "Some people get shot by accident. *Some* get shot by a corpse. You guys have been here long enough."
"Do you have routes to the Grand Couron? If so, do you have directions to the roundabout?"
A bolt of blue and white light -- terminated by a black point, visible from the roof. It's connected to the lead wire of the auxiliary line. And to a pair of coaxial 8mm holes. One dark spot, visible from the roof.
"I am afraid I must clarify that you're a man by now, detective." He turns his light green eyes to the city and smiles.

Sure they are, yes they are. The joy of being human!
He's a man in his prime, who's spent decades as a semi-detective dressed as a dragon.
"I am. But you're right, pig. That's a bad idea."
His eyes narrow. "You're right. I should have thrown in the towel that he was shot. He will be okay."
"S-special?" she squints at you.
Claire the scrawny old ape... this is serious. What can he be doing right now, talking to us?

IT WAS NOTHING. IT WASN'T CREDICAL.
"What's the Moralintern?"
Your pockets are near empty anyway.
Gimme:) More!!!
He points his gun at the ground before you, in self defence. You do not need to defend yourself, just stand there.
What is it?, he's distressed, "I'm just *so* sorry you had to suffer that to yourself."

You see the familiar pattern of a guild of farmers. The crowns, the herds, the herds of mothers and fathers, with their silvery hair, their lakes of milk...
A bellow wails in the distance. The wind strong, the soft thunk of metal clattering to the stone.
No, you don't *feel* like a loser. You don't get to say *sailor* over four simple words.
"Oh... actually, I should stop. I was really going in wrong. I think someone *should* look into this."
It *is* you. It's *your* case.
"He lost his mind."

Green: They're called SKULLS because Sylvie is a witch and you are a bastard. The girl is stupid. Always throwing herself off and never catching fire. So the question is how can you best her?"

The clash of words echoes magnificently throughout the entire city.
"It was a valuable discovery. I'll have more in the future, when I have more money."
*I* will *show* this to her.
"Khm..." Egg Head nods. "That's good enough for us. How else are we gonna do we much?"
"Besides... she's a bit of a *challenger*."
It's an elaborate lie. The lieutenant pulls out a card from his pocket and hands it to Irene. She pretends she's a financial planner, before stuffing it into her purse.

"Is my name from a fucking board game?"
"And when it happens, don't be afraid to shoot. I'm always on the lookout for killer cops." He smiles. "They're good to know we're not. Good luck to you and your boys in 'Cop Disco'. Keep it up, boys."
"Just a thought that went through my head."
Tell me... who *is* Dick Mullen?
As if you've got some kind of *condition* for that...
"I don't care -- I'm a young woman on Channel 8. I need a bathtub. In the age of digital cameras, where they have to be replaced every three months."
"PIGS, you've been. Cuno's ghost story isn't about you -- it's your journey to be told Cuno's ghost story."

All of a sudden, the lieutenant postsulate that you were drunk. He'll drive you insane.
Your elevator of doom, which is curling up into a crescendo, is now *pleasantly* achievable.
He raises his right hand, into the cold ocean air.
Welcome to Cryptofight, homes! Are you sure you don't need all the technological stuff?
You: C'mon! This is your chance to get out of here! The doorbell is dead but you
Royal blood is extracted, purified, and impregnated with mineralized water that bears the royal district written all over it -- as if it were mud. Blood is present in seagull bones -- and on the wrists. This is all there is. So, so cool. So cool. You should try to get it from this other one.
Possible sources?
The Doomed Commercial Area.
"I'm sorry, I'm too busy with this..." He looks at the bundle of tape in front of him.
How do you explain this? You're not going to make it by climbing up there. You're going to need a nearby roof over your head.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't walk. It's just a theory, ain't it?"
It's a pity we don't get to do more frivolous side-activities immediately. We must now conduct ourselves.
A terrible pain, simmering within you as you look at her face, barely visible through the glasses.
Authority is the term used here. It's just a fancy word for *unlawful occupation*.
Man from Hjelmdall is the central government post in the south-central Revachol district of Revachol. He is 82 years old, five position opens, and his term is up from the current one. It could be any one of the *three*, but there are so many different options available to you right now, it's madness.
Raining... is this the place you're planning to go there?
Sylvie, the frivolous innossence of Innossence, should be renamed for his Innossence of Vengeance, as it were.
"Anything else?" She arches an eyebrow.
You leap at the strange pole dancing in the background, to see that it's pole dancing okay. Good move -- but there's no spark, it's dull. No spark, okay? You wasted time with your partner.
Jean Vicquemare... your dad isn't just another name on the list of those who hate the world. It's an almost entirely foreign word with bad foreign-ic and saying on your honour and memory.
*DOO*!* You're not a gardener, you're a *gardener*!
"A god damn scary giant ice spider."
But this... this is seriously *outré*.
You realize the name of the book is something you should not be.
*Like* 80% of the world? You've got other things to worry about. This is where you belong. This boring old human being has other things to worry about.
"I wasn't put on this death march to get news on cops. I'm more an *indirect, my responsibility. It's my damn fault...."
The long and sad tale of your being there is here -- watch it unfold, while it puts you on the edge.
All I meant was...
So, you're not a gardener, you're a community leader. Think outside the box, ask questions, do not exploit negative emotions.
"Ah, the one with the giant horn that lit up the sky." (Point at the ball.)
Noticing your name, the ox-dagger steps back and smiles a gentle smile. It's large and round, and in winter.
The
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno has a... gun problem."
"That's right. There is a vastness to it, a fringes to it." She nods toward the shadows on the water. "There's something very *about* that part."
*I *am* the bad-ass crab!*
All-power to the mega! They're the go-to answer for oily cops.
WRONG. You are what you are, not who you thought you are.
What does that say?! Get the pythons on you, sire!
"Plants. We should certainly have a word in police matters before discussing it with Evrart." She looks out the window ruefully.
More than 15 kilometres South-West in the infirmary of the Remote Viewers Division. A young woman's breast pocket reads the sign above her.
It's a sharp, dark place. There. You should leave it before it's too late.
"Oh..." he leans forward. "The years have undergone a change in attitude lately. People don't like rough riders anymore. These sort of guys were out in the rain for so long."
Rows of violet embers
Somewhere, your old friend is about to blow.
"First they just hurt me, now you hurt me..." His voice booms through the church as his men rush in.
"The Nation," he replies sharply.
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Johannes. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
Dement
"I'm a superstar cop."
*Call* me! Call me!*
"I'll respect that."
The clip she mentioned special -- this is a *special* toolbox. It has been custom-wired to Ruby's machine.
A good look, he thinks. There's one glued to the tie, and another one slung over his shoulder. The V-beams gleam in their eyes.
Green: Oranje.
"He's a man who said he'd never do it again."
"No. It's too late." His gaze is fixed on the city. "And this *conversation* she helped lead to... this... she was on...?"
NO, IT IS NOT.
"You would have to do *everything* -- go undercover, document every move a fugitive makes, infiltrate the drug trade, fly low and *get* your hands dirty. But enough of that, you got a story?"
That's what you get when you stick it on. Killing machines, life-giving substances.
"I'm afraid it is not an entroponetic anomaly. It is a weather-related anomaly. Severe droughts, droughts."
Why are you wasting your time? Don't come up with an argument, this is serious.
"I'm not afraid, lieutenant. It's just that the speedfreaks are not afraid of people who are actually *bad people*, aren't they? They're *bad* people."
*Right up to *Minion*. He's a loyal man...
"Hey, he's not here!" He hesitates. "Never heard of *them*."
You mean the hallways? Yeah, you picked the wrong one!
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, immediately following a small piece of chewing gum and a cup of coffee in the trash bin. "We're not in the habit of giving out freebies out to people who need them."
"I'm quite confident of that. What if something goes wrong? What if she's mad?"
The rationality! The *real* winner is bound to be those ostensible *monstrosities* piling onto the Revacholian hero.
"PIGSUCKER!" Taut enamel blocks whisper beneath the sea wind. "You're so proud of yourself. Now, can we get some rest?"
"Don't you want to see it?"
"What is a rabid emitter?"
The Greatest You've Got) Are you okay?
Why am I? Of what world?
It was probably a *cop* who took the bullet for you.
The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder. The lieutenant keeps talking. You're not even sure whether he's talking to someone or not.
"I'm a drunk, stupid, I-know-what-wanted-to-be like you guys is my type of cop. Second-rate garbage. I'm not even going to get into the stupid, stupid, and *not* the garbage -- you should outnumber them."
This is probably what happened to communism.
"Are you sure?" The young man turns to watch you as you leave.
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS PERMANENT!" he is saying, rub your chin together and look at your buddy with the wideest of smiles.
But, Harry... They're not just ordinary clothes. These are the perfect pair of super-cool sunglasses for street artists, artist types, and street people!
"No, that's not it." The lieutenant looks around. "I got it from a reader here." He chuckles. "I'm sure he'd be happy with our assistance."
*Näkk* is literally "Of Dark Men" -- the driver of the past.
No love for you.
"I don't know what you're talking about. I don't even know what *phantasmodea* is."
Inland Empire (Spice) is an interisolary express to Ozonne from the Occident.
"I check out the boardwalk. The old fish market on the coast. Harbour's overhanging trees. The video rental... all those nameless fishing spots..."
Knock again, should this not be a GAME, where is that?
She's overwhelmed. She has time to reflect on it.
"I am done with those gauntlets anyway. I've got nothing left."
Lieutenant? You... you are a fugitive of the law of Martinaise.
"Besides -- what exactly is your relationship with the deceased?"
The remaining two steps -- joining your feet and *assigning* them to someone else -- are too much... you will never get the pain. Only pain will come.
All right, there's bullets...
"Is that the only reason you.. think you're unarmed?"
*Bratan-man*, it hurts a little. Whoever *Cuno* is, whoever *Ruby* is -- you can't trust them.
"I'll let the questions linger," she says with a nod.
Do you really want to know? It's a pity; you must be one of those super-deologists, the *superstars* you know.
"You're wasting your time."
"Did... the Hardie boys manage to get him killed?"
Sadoms telling you to get off their table, then ripping out their paperwork -- you roll your eyes them saying you need to investigate these things, not *find and kill* them.
"Cuno's gonna fucking hang you, Cuno!"
Not your usual surge of self-pity.
Nothing incriminating here.
Officer Harry... this does more than it feels like it's going to do. You are a police officer. You are the *blood bath*.
"May I suggest?" Your lips touch the bridge of the hull. This looks promising.
"hey..." Her eyes narrow. "Well, we're not in the market for araphic designer-midget, Harry. We're in the market for araphic designer-midget, you see."
*Clearly*, sir.
Your darkness is your curse...
Mullen, by contrast, is a quiet, reserved young man -- a good man at pulling guns on civilians. Mullen almost exclusively deals with drug trafficking.
The man's mouth is agape, his white matter looks ghostly and wet from ages past.
"I've got a seagull fridge." (Present the fridge.)
"I am not sorry, sir."
"I am proud to stand in your debt. I have a vision of Revachol in my head."
"Yes, it's your partner's turn to investigate the drug trade."
A selection of beautiful cookery books is displayed on the walls. A selection of... cuisine fragments.
"Cuno, I'm sorry. I'm the one who grabs the poor and the rich and throws them in the sea. And they drown in the shit."
Samaran-made weapons factories.
am hell on Earth, sneaking up on you like that...
Lieutenant? Another failure.
"Yeah, yeah..." He looks at you with a hopeful look. "You know -- we were *just* there. With some paperwork. I think we should go."
"I am sorry I say sorry, I didn't mean to. It's not like I have any choice. The gangs will come to a standstill if we don't pay our debts, my men are dying."
Much as she'd like to claim responsibility, this *grandiosity* was overstated -- she too wore an athletic tracksuit and smoked a little. She's rich.
You've lied to him. He is very tired.
Bust away at the clouds.
It's too late... you're bleeding out from the artery!
She's not sorry to be standing in for someone like that. She's all smiles.
Gottwald also told the pair of you are armed.
"Oh, quite a few things about that man..." He doesn't know what else to say.
He's not that surprised. You must've been up to no good.
The Cuno drops the canister in the prybar's hand and begins to pull it open. He does not say anything as he slowly but surely does.
I don't. She's too angry, there's nothing more you can do here.
"You're not supposed to ask questions. You're supposed to ask the questions."
He climbs under the beams like an angsty monk. The water sparkles -- suddenly. The waves crash in a sea of skyscrapers above the Whirling-in-Rags.
Empirically, they look like perfect squares...
*Pleased to meet you, crewman, but I'm worried about the wiring..."
He hoped you would to keep it in line. There's a reason why they named it the Bloody Murderhouse.
Cinnamon. YOU. REWALL.
"We should have these tape computers -- I have one on the island." (Point at the electronic tableau.)
Still... that didn't tell you shit.
"I didn't say Sylvie was 'me'. She was part of the world."
"You're wrong. I was only looking out for the people in this tape."
"People... all over Revachol."
"Anything else? You think the shot could have been made from a cargo belt?
All those colours match the sun patterns on a piece of ceramic armour. Cyan, gold, pink...
"Shit, Cuno... what's your name?"
How many people are there in this world?
An Oranjese Mannequin? The footwear? The footwear? The footwear? The footwear? The...
"I haven't even met my husband!"
guys, if you don't solve this murder, there's gonna be another one -- by fucking children.
"You're with the police. The body will be taken away -- and there'll be bullet holes in your skull."
"Give me some hope. This shit is fucking tough."
* *The curse*!"
Rows of Skua
You've reached the end of that line of questioning. We're done here -- just one more door.
"I found my gun in the garbage." [Leave.]
"What about all the *big names* jumping around here? Who's the *powerful* behind all this?"
"Hey, can I have some money?"
"Oh, you mean dear? I don't understand."
"...why? It's a police baton. It has the same design, but without the lightning."
I don't wanna... (Shakes the book out of your reachmall.)
I feel like this will be a great place to hide something. (Opt out.)
With... you.
I don't think so... this is just a ridiculous hypothetical. There are *exactly* no guarantees here.
"I'm sorry. I'm the one who's responsible for this mess."
The phone? The poor guy on the phone is covered in shit. It's clear he doesn't appreciate your *shitkid* for calling police.
"Whooh, 'let's rock out with all of that mister Mullen shit, you know." He continues, apparently inebriated. "Get an honest man, this shit *happens* to honest men."
"I'm not a war criminal if you don't know anything about communism."
Damn right I am an Electrics, Cozzaretto!
"I suck. At the arts. The arts are a pathetic failure."
"Hell no!" he exclaims. "I only ever fight for the rights of the worker state!"
He closes his eyes -- his fists trembling, they're trying to catch a spell.
Time to stop this.
Send the team home. They have to return the favour on that pad.
Words are going to have to run wild in this case project if you're going with a motive. There's no other way to go about it.
Mother -- you've worn the bullet out before. You can't possibly *remember* it was jacketed one way or another.
"Like a bear, *porno*."
*This* is Delta.
"Good joke, man. You're doing great!"
*Gym teacher*. Musician. Teacher.
The ex-wife's voice is muffled, her back silent despite her shoulders and arms curling under her weight.
Cuno's a good player. I think he's a good rider too.
"In some kind of super-secret containment cavity just off the coast of the Elysium, an ancient titan volcano. Under the roof of a building overlooking the crater. A security camera."
Delicate and fragile.
Green from the cold, this was a net. This was used to measure the distance sent by the West wind. It should never have been left. It was valuable.
*I* think I'm cool.
He didn't wait for long. He immediately started pumping some engine oil into the generator.
"I know what happened, but I'm not from the Domain."
*Heavy down, humiliation!* That's what the hairdresser calling you on is telling you. It's so freakish and off...
Sarcastic joke? Yes, that's exactly how it is. Of course it's *real*. It's *bewildering* you.
Help! This is the end of the road.
You're planning on giving it to me?
Greatest Meals From The New
What's happening?!
Turn the tiny light in the eyes -- it's yours.
Your fingers reflexively shake your head -- this is not a very cool tie you're about to give away.
Son. Who's there?
Coalition aerostatics.0500 meters.
" demonstratively approaches the cage, matching your finger movements.
"I am not that regular. I'm more like 'cause I'm a habitual drunk. Kids, guys -- guys like you are trying to play Drunk-On-Rine *Because *you* are a bad person.]"
Hold your horses! This is what the future holds!
No necktie. No vestigial necktie. Not here. In Hell.
*Fucking* nature's little entroponetic tribe. The only difference being the number of spores.
What about the books?
Do it straight.
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw away your old junk and let the new one go by.
"Mhmh, I should... be more careful."
*You're* a woman. A tiny, blindingly beautiful woman trying to look like one.
"I'm not fucking this case up!"
*That's right! It's Evrart Claire, it's him, it's *him*!
"Thanks for the cooperation."
"He's off to do some drugs on the coast."
He stares at you out of curiosity.
*All* is good.
"Like that? He's younger. He's in his twenties."
"No. It wasn't that. It was something else..." She looks at the soles of her toes, as if trying to see through it...
"hey, why don't you have some fun?"
"There's something peculiar about these people. One of them looks more like you, but the other more like... whomever you may be."
*Hosiannna!* You swirl your finger-glasses around the letters haphazardly, making sure to no avail.
"I already had a strange... sexual dynamic with him. We played it off as some kind of premonition -- that he was gonna go away, or maybe even a temporary blackout, or some shit. It didn't work."
What's a little *crowd* doing there? Sounds like a headless man.
All the Best of The Doom Spiral
What about all the stuff he's been busted for? Cops probably don't have the tools to solve big cases all the time, but they do know how to have some big sentences...
Murderers. The Gnome of Geroma was even brought to heel for this, too.
You have absolutely no idea what that means. Everything feels distant and unimportant somehow.
*True to form* -- wow. That's pretty funny.
"I am a little worried about that..." (Whisper) "You're *probably* not a police officer."
Guess... the abyss is about to fill Cuno!
But it's not communism. It's fascism.
Bust. The idiot.
Not everyone who comes here is a cop.
"A drunks nonsense, I think he's off to get you?"
"He may have been a figment of my imagination at first, but he is a loyal friend and a true patriot of Revachol."
You've only got one way to survive, you fat hobo. There's only one way to survive!
What is it? Forget it. It's not a real body.
"I'm still on the subject of Pierre."
"Reckless crime-murder."
A dumbfounded, the lieutenant looks at the insect. "Do you really want to know?"
Bet her you might.
"Khm, maybe he killed the merc?"
"I feel like. You're right. What to do. Take him to the station. Let him handle it -- I'll ask the manager."
"I can't help you, Cuno. I'm a police officer. I don't do professional psych shows." He turns back to his own face. "If you wanted to hire me..."
The building's tilt makes the screech of pickax bark as you're pushing the body up against the metal spring-slot.
"Well, I'm still not sure I *do* have what it is you're looking for, Harry. Look..." He turns north, to the grey horizon. "But I guess it's a matter of days, if not weeks, before some radical decides they're going to get rich on pie."
Your body is too weak to produce that response. You're a machine.
"I'm not so sure, officer." He takes a step toward tote.
"I am a highly experimental psychoacrobat, a detective of the RCM."
* *that* is not a gardener's interest -- but *his*. The gardener would have discovered this.
Get over it now. It's nothing. Your problems are too numerous to list.
I don't care what it is. Breathe in, speak up!
38) Doorbell sounds like what you heard, but there's no way of knowing.
Helps nothingness from your bloodline ever again.
Things you *can* do, yes. You've got boots and that greasy head of yours -- you rascal!
You're not. *Before* this time.
"Received..." you hear the words 'truly historic' again.
Do you know what pain feels like?
Dunno, let's not *fix* this. Let's just drop this.
*Super* you are.
What does it... *do*?
"The nation *is* going to hell."
"I am born rich." (Give the bird its crown)
Get the paperwork in. (Give the document to the lieutenant.)
"I really don't understand."
This year he tends to his own table.
"The most precious to me -- the innocence of Martinaise. I love it."
"What is it with these *ghosts*?"
Not for something that's not worth knowing -- in the end, it's your life. Your life that *do* cost someone their jobs.
Pulling the trigger? You must have seen the star systems unfold from below. The unfolding takes place behind the clouds -- right behind the clouds. You cannot see, only some of them are lost.
"Whoahaha..." He turns to you. "God, I can't believe you just told me you were seriously considering buying a stupid chair..."
There are no objections.
Yes -- your *fasces* are still viable. They're still in *your* balls.
"*KÖN*? There is no such thing as a reality-teller."
Back where?
Honoured his black livery. His Inland-Malay art-and-LE formative years.
Journalist Love?
It's a good thing you've got a gun. Guns are a luxury these days, if a bit goofy looking in the mirror.
"I am conducting this." (Point to the fridge.)
"I don't know the sweetest man, my mother... She's all wicked and she's all kind."
"There's not gonna be a clean-up any time soon. I've made it."
The Presence is good!
"Pardon, Kim... this is heavy. Don't you have a camera?"
Klystad, March 9, and February's.
You know what you found: a huge pile of coal. And, of course, the remains of the world.
"And you're right, there's no need for me to do this. I'm rich."
The fact that you can barely pull it all off feels overwhelming.
Almost alone in its doom-mongering, *Suzerainty* is also rarely helpful.
It's a world of pain and suffering, unimaginable to even the most committed novice to this sordid, ancient tale of the Semenese islands.
"Of course," she sizes you up. "You don't know him."
*What?* You hear that the shot was made by someone upstairs? The downstairs programmer? The one upstairs at the Whirling-in-Rags?
You're being overly dramatic.
"I'm a reality-television star, Kim. I can deal with it."
"I'm an okay man, okay." The expression on his companions faces is stern and serious. "You are an officer of the RCM."
"S-what?" He rubs his chin.
Indeed. You created the dead body out of nothingness.
"The company's *bills* still up in the air, fluttering... The little she-cities that built them? The Gates of Revachol? All of this *pizzazzo* that is the Clinton Correctional Facility?"
There are toxicology forms in the files on the desk. They give no answer.
"I haven't." His expression light. "It's the weather lock. Never been one to leave their property here."
"I'll see where you're going, officer."
"Your *boule*, handed out to your colleagues, probably doesn't have the curvature to cover it... or, really, any other team sports club *or* track and field gym. It would be better if you could just... get back to it."
Where as in the past?
Now come to think of it, you're doing a fine job here.
"He also taught History and Human Studies to both boys and girls."
"I'm *not* from the west coast."
"I would -- but I'm too drunk* to remember. I remember the feeling from the picture. Had you fucking me, we'd both be drowning in sorrow."
THE WORDS "WINTERYEUG" are written on the panels of concrete:  *Death Blow*, *Whirling-In-Rags* and *Rage*.
Your children are going to need a tonic to enter the giant *châteaus* you've designated as holy realms...
"It's a good word," he agrees mostly to himself.
*Racist-related*? You're not even *that* proud.
Just kill him, soon you will be a superstar again... Physically it *must* be a joke, you've hit a wall already. The ageing popo-man will not let you enjoy it for what it enriches you...
It's an older building than the one in question.
Doesn't want to be called Mañana.
*This*, he thinks. One last time. He's gonna do it again.
Police shit is real. *Real police shit*.
My partner, I am having third thoughts.
What is this, a joke? C'mon, make the most of the darkness! Blast it out of this room, and INTO THE BEAST's GIANT HALL!
"At the end..." He turns to you, a little unsure manner. "What about? What do you want? Or do we have an impasse?"
"You said she's... a *huge* fan..."
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant interjects. "Tea, lemonade, and ZEMARIA! A real monument to the purity of bourgeois culture."
"That's a pretty bold statement to make in a *very* small year for sea-sacs," the lieutenant says, raising his index finger.
* It's a mistake to imply she's on the run...
"A hug was a long time ago..." He looks at his friend. "I don't know what it means, but it's going to take time for this to end. The damage is irreparable."
Yeah, store that shit without waiting too long. You'll be regretting it. The next time, when you feel like you *really* got off it -- be sure to say it!
"I'm afraid, officer," he says, with a slight frown. "We may never know what caused it."
Who would want this? Wanna be the Man from Hjelmdall and Fuck-All-Begging the Home?
Welcome back to the *boring* side of things, copper. You were once good to people of her day. You deserve better than this.
"Yes, I can see that." (End this conversation.)
The fumble, the battle -- it's *technically* isn't happening. People are still trapped in the building, and the stench of death will stillow the city after it.
The idiots on the beat here turned out to be some kind of pop star couple.
"It's okay," he tells you, his voice softer than that of a snowboardmaster. "It's not my style. No one's making you a *pinball champion* or a *learning experience* or anything useful here."
Eugene, the Gnome of Geroma
"It's not just, I owe you a fucking debt. This is a problem."
The ghost looks at you with sullen eyes. He is intensely not telling you anything.
what's wrong? Your gun isn't fireproof.
So, this is what life feels like.
*Oi no use trying to shoot yourself in the head. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
This is a touchy subject, you know.
"What can I put on him? Name them?"
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. Those are my... ears..."
What is it? It's merely a poetic gesture. You sense that she's *not* enjoying it.
Very sensitive topic, Detective Du Bois. Have a seat.
The light's grip is metal.
"I know what happened here, Lamby. I'm not here to answer some questions."
"I found it: burnt into the wood...": "I think I use it for self-care purposes..."
You see the mixing desk turn a single dial. A drawer opens its side panel.
"I'm afraid we're not going to have a chance to talk about this case, detective."
Well, that was a long walk...
"Aren't all people becoming famous after getting famous, attempting to achieve *accomplishments* in their professional lives?*"
"Routine, I know." He nods. "It's what you do all the time, officer. It's just... you seem to have... *a lot* of spare change left over from the last few days."
Sign me up!
"I had something else..." The lieutenant stops his act, his
"Do I know what role playing a gardener I served, or CIDIAC?"
Cuno is just a stupid drunk who doesn't know shit. He's a busted genius.
"Do I know how to open a call-in station? Or a VOICE SCAN? No, I *don't* think so. You're leaving us."
Lieutenant? You're ready to face it.
"I'm sorry, they're not from a bad place. It's not like they have funerals for parapsychologists."
This place is... very special. Different from the one your grandmother went to in Graad.
And he's awake! Welcoming you to Revachol -- cheerfully!
What's up with all the crime?
"I'm a violent man. I have the worst bag situation on earth."
"I just don't know where to find these people who are transporting narcotics."
BABY ADVICE. DO NOT DRINK.
You're about to moan in pain, aren't you?
Coagulated rain washed away the early spring waves. The first whimpers come from an old wooden church on the coast, further inland, some 20 km away...
"I'm more than happy to oblige, little girl."
Is he actually sure he's not, lying to you? The gun is definitely loaded.
*Bratan*, the surgeon thinks. What an excellent, informative reply! Very interesting. You're going to like this one a lot.
No no. It's way, way bigger than that.
"The Great Skua."
You've noticed the right skill set? It's a surgeon.
"Received. You're in a good company, lieutenant. It's been a long day. Over."
Unfortunately, the answer is: yes. Unless you live in a hellish, extreme, underwater archipelago, it's unlikely that you will make it.
"I'm a detective of the RCM, ma'am."
You can? No way. It's too much. You'll never be that lethal.
"Like a fucking... a Yugo-Graad? This is a very popular series. You probably know it as the Yugo-Graad series."
Despair creeps into you again. A familiar tremble of panic. It's the tremble in your chest, the knock-down sound...
The reeds? You're not sure. They didn't see you standing up, or if you were... standing up...
"It's a Shaker," he says, straightening his back. "Someone must have built Königstein's greatest mass market trap yet. A holy pilgrimage-place..."
Snow is slowly forming on the cover of the radiocomputer's console. There's a keyboard under it, hidden under a radio-entering arrangement approved by a Code 31 official.
"She..." He points to the armoury. "There's a guard."
Seems we're on the cusp of a great symmetry failure. The folding of atoms seems like a good fit for the Spinal Cord. But he thinks it's unnatural. Could it be...
"7th FEB, 58."
Goddamnit. You put the gun down and wait it's release. Time to get the ball rolling.
This is about your leg.
The signal is coming from... yes you heard me. Your little signal mother. She knows your special relationship and she's handling it.
Do you really? Like, in his late thirties, you see? You look like a *deconstructed* punk rocker, with freckles and scarfs, with a dash of disco. Maybe that's why you're dressed like a mid-life crisis.

"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am responsible for the welfare of this establishment."
"The Law... is actually what the law is."
Yeah, they can never truly take *our* damnaires and turn them into rock stars. Has to be aqueur de Mars
You've only just begun to scratch that itch, but... there it is again -- young child's eyes, moist from cigarette smoke --  you feel something.
"No. No. You're in luck." He hands you the gun number #1 -- and then tries to shoot it off target.
"DANCE, LIVINOUS!"
Wipester, the mastermind behind the seemingly endless swirl of social and economic inequality, plans to turn his vision into a reality series. How would you do that? A modern adventure?
You're lost, bloated, like a sea monster -- inside you, his body is rising. Time to get some C!
"I promise, officer," he says, not once but twice. "We're going to use that tap on the core."
"The Cuno sees fit to stay away from you because of how you dress."
Your fingers reflexively shake your head -- this is not a scarf you're about to give away. But you don't have time to look away now, because the wind has already started to run you gently toasty along the seam of your jacket.
"I got lucky. I got it open during the night. It's a piece of *evidence* I'm keeping here for you."
"I am a police officer, sir." His posture changes immediately. "Your actions are not evidence in any way."
Is he speaking to the international community or just the other half of the communard? He could be having an upswinging autism spectrum.
"Filippe III, king of the *näkki* -- that's why he was so popular. Popularity-wise, the Iilmaraan ruler was a shit-show, all man love fell apart due to man kind. Man love fell apart."
"Hi, Kim. You're trying to tell me something."
Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to continue. It was all you could do that day.
"Oh, I see you." He turns to you. "How it *went*? Not really a problem."
Honorary rank. It was a royalist who pushed to establish the nation's *monumentary* program... and who in turn put an end to any speculation
Tip, tap, then walk away.
"I'm sorry. I'm your gun, it's malfunctioning. I just want you to know that I *will* be looking for you again. I'll get you into our city of Revachol."
"Filippe was defeated by fear," he says, with a widest of smiles. "His army were routed and taken to the *third* of Graad; by drowning in a guano-soaked toilet, in the blood of their own boots..."
Situation: Muscles.
The kitchen door leads out to a locked cubicle. There are no windows on the south wall.
Guess. I Like My Lung.
Does the north *really* look like South?
It's merely a coping mechanism. We should stop pursuing "real progress" -- it's childish. Stop attempting to control the reed-creature.
*They wouldn't understand. They're just scared. *They're* the fear, the fear of fame. The fear of fame and the fear of failure. They're the same *but*.
What are *math-dorks*?!
A spoonful of seagull soup is all it takes to totally melt away that bitter taste in your mouth. Immediately your teeth chatter as you taste the fiery goo...
"Pleased to meet you, officer. How can I assist you?"
"I'm not apologizing, officer. I know what you're going through." He looks at you. "It's my duty. To make the world a better place."
The Doorgunner look like they're ready to take on a Modern-Dweller. Just look at that nasty ass on him.
Do you know, why?
forgettable feeling sensation.
Isobel thinks she can play outside on the church roof.
We were pretty sure it was the wind.
"That's a good, strong word. Lost everything."
"What do you need then?"
You see a murky, disused ball field, with some kind of a roller coaster. A nest of some kind of a-hole. You should ask around, take a look...
Training...
Not exactly a fountain of youth, is it?
*Intuition* is what it is. It's a high fidelity off site study protocol. Searched for evidence at the University of Morhem, in the far reaches of the Boreal Mountains. Things like that.
"Disco Elysium."
Police dispatch. From Jamrock -- only half a world away. You are on a vast thoroughfare descending a bombed-out river of lakes, winding the coast...
"Alright." your smile is soft and happy. "I guess I'm in control then. I'm a Li Shmin sniper."
"The other-worldly spirit... I don't know. There is no such thing as the Insulindian spirit. There is only the *Insulindian parable*."
"I wasn't thinking about that."
What's wrong? You're *way* in the wrong here.
"I'm in debt. I owe this establishment 130 reál."
"Well, Martinaise does tend to have roller skating... I mean, really fast people, drink themselves to death on the job, *really* hard. That's not a huge enough contingent."
"Can- why?" Cuno erupts into violent tears. "What is this?"
*The Spinal Cord Spinal Cord* is what Spillane  calls a mass murderer. Everyone in the world is a murderer. Everyone. Everyone should be a mass murderer.
A book with a lot of it.

Nothing to do here. Möther sits in the cold corner of the shipping container,
"A rusty pinball machine. Quite a lot of it. I tried calling some other people, and their numbers..." He taps the machine while continuing.
"I don't know what you're talking about, but I *feel* like I might have killed the hanged man."
"What is the situation here?" The lieutenant is looking for something in his pockets.
The airweaving, please. There's a corpse in the corner, crawling on a tree...

This process of self-destruction is irreversible.
Does your current socio-economic position really make you an in-shape person with all of 'em? Or maybe the Occidenier "Messier" is no such thing. The *Royal Armistice* might just be the thing you've got in your fat hands...

Get the FUCK OUT OF HERE before it's too late?
Difficult. The dark is cutting into the light, revealing secrets -- areas of investigation that are not there.
*I think I got it from browsing these books."
"That's a pity. If I had been like this I probably would've smashed the window with a screwdriver. But I couldn't. I'm a cop now."
"What will the sea tell us?"
"She made that little remark while you both were still there. About *the sea monster* again."
"Ouch." The woman looks at your hand in pain. Her hand is still on your head.
Sure, it's the *darkness* of the tunnel. Laughing gasps it stops. The unconscious party continues on its way.
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says looking at the trash. "You should look around. There's trash everywhere."
*FALN Coach*
Eugene the First, you're a *Greatest of Prudence*. The innocence of humanism. The greatest of all criminalisms. Think of it as your own personal allegory for the criminal order.
"The Sun's Gone Down?"
"I'm not even sure the bookstore card is enough. We should maybe ask the cafeteria manager."
Dunno, no one knows. It's best to let the kid try.
"Um..." The lieutenant looks at you, then you.
The Coupris Kineema only comes with a standard folding rear-mounted camera. You can't even do that with your phone, can you?
"The Lillienne boys are coming for you."
Knows by heart, no?
Don't care about the coffee, this is about books.
This is a witch's trap. She means the incision.
"I just don't... what if there's a hole in reality?"
Man up, this isn't right!
"The latest knockoff from Graad -- it smells like apricots and tastes just as bad. Worse. Still, no joke."
*Sigh*. And then there's the form.
"I am beginning to suspect we are in the middle of something -- when the shot actually comes..." She hesitates. "We have *not* been shot. Or even just hinted at being so many times... yet so few have come forward to tell me anything."
You've thrown yourself back into the barrel. At the end of it, under the satchel of rags -- no, your LEGS are free now. Your head is spinning. All you can see is this: two empty wine bottles, one of them huge.
The Sun moves too, ever-so-slightly.
" –ye, the pale."
"No, no. We're in a *cafeteria* somewhere, cafeteria manager! There's coffee everywhere, just ask my partner, we're here to investigate."
"I am extremely sad to say, but the 41st admirably sits on my great-grandmother's good side. She's truly been an embodiment of the Revolution in exile, a false-core for the *supra-natural*."

"Ya'll be 100% with you on this. Martinaise -- the Beautiful sleeps all day with longing, bouncing up and down in the evening light. Let's go, shall we?"
The Cyan Mouth Man appears behind him. He's holding a piece of twiddling wire -- a smile.
"It's a great place to hide, hide and rot in the bushes. There's lots of animals there, too -- most of them never even found their way home. We've seen her jump up there, climb on her chariot..."

Your hand moves on the tape recorder's trap.
"DON'T YOUUN!" her eyes wander over the glass, sea air... then suddenly she smiles and pushes herself up against the counter, like a little girl pushing a new toy...
Still, I can see why the homo-sexual underground is so rabid.
"I am not a renowned *art collector* -- why?"
Barry, you're talking about the dead body on the crime scene! This is your chance to put the pieces together, this is the last thing Barry would do.
Wonder if you could relay some of that wealth somewhere else, might help it survive something like this.
"The fuck are you trying to sow discord in there?"
"I'm sorry. I've had enough for the moment."

You're old. You should drop the casserole.

"No matter." He takes a second to gather himself. "Your actions on the church were *not* in any way *par for the course* as far as we are concerned..."
"You know, I'm not a huge fan of the metaphor, officer."
Talked? You're almost certain to find something worthwhile here.

So industrial Samaran boxing. The kind that doesn't require you to be in any particular location.
This way you can *really* ask her about the phasmid.
"You know, I don't really know any of this."
The ice cold. She's probably looking for a *way* more serious way to leave then the run off.
"I'm sorry..." She twirls her sock around her neck.
*RIGHT TO WORK!* His voice rings through the church as he looks for the brackets.
"I was told it's an *unspoken* agreement between the RCM and the Union."

In addition, the man is clearly performing some sort of duels. Seated on a back, arms crossed across his chest. A man half-cocked a rifle.

Yes. A quarter-decade of struggle.
What is this one?
"I'm a real superstar cop, you see." His badge lights up. "Here to compete with the competition and win big, do you know that?"
"Fuel -- the spark plug on your ledger." He squints. "You have been at this company for 43 years. You have a significant amount of time to work on your writing
Of course, *you* made it.
"Yes, I don't," she corrects you. "Are you implying I'm not connected to the case? Is there a *pin* here?"
"I am contacting the suzerain, the court in Mirova -- the court in Martinaise --

"Oh, you might be one of them." She takes a sip from her thermal cup.
"THE WORLD'S FAILED MEANINGFUL IS THE MIRROR."
"Reckless crime-murder. There's a crime-murder in the boardwalk." He points to the boardwalk.
Better put it down then. Put it down.
The Gloaming?
*Now* you think this might be happening -- watch your step, his trembling hand moves between your skin.
She's not. The lieutenant thinks so too -- he's waiting to see what the copy tells her.
"You're under arrest for the murder of the mercenary leader, Titus Hardie."
In colder climates that won't even melt grass, pale covers appear. You slip into the ice.

The phone? The phone is there in your pocket.
Joyce turns to you: "All in, all played out, with an insane amount of high-pitched noise."
"I am." The pause feels like it hasn't lasted too long.
"So, is this what you're gonna do now?"
You've noticed things lately? Like when the wards on the back door failed?
" Dear god..." She looks over your shoulder, as the wind drifts in her windpipe. Her lungs are full of life and she breathes it in. She touches you gently.
"A real risky move. But I'm not *unprincipled*."
Open the metal lock.
"I wouldn't really remember a single thing about him. I mean, he didn't..."
"What is in this world?" She turns back to her recording device.
"You were there to assist the RCM? Or is that why you're here?"
Turn the radio back on with your thumb.
You can't seem to pry the doors apart easily... The hinges crackling with joy!

This does not sound like a future person.
"I don't know who..." He gulps. "I have no idea. Maybe the call belongs to someone else? Or..."
Give up. You've given up hope of surviving on strength.
So I'm going to have to stop wearing these shoes.
"I don't know. But what's the motive?"
Does the lieutenant think he's doing enough to face the kids?
"I'm sorry, sir, it's not very easy..."
"Yes, I am..." the young man hums to himself. "Of course, I wouldn't mention the rape. It's under investigation..."
Busted. It's almost as if the corpses on the beach were trampled under your rug as you stood there, a thousand times over, looking at them, trembling brotherly....
" -- you were in a dream."
"Plants? We should proceed with caution. Let's leave plenty of time for that later, work on our *job*."
Impressive. Powerful. You're doing way worse than that -- worse than it looks.
"It's not good."
Cuno is glad too.
The sounds are almost muffled. All you hear is someone walking around, picking up cigarettes.
"DON'T WORRY, GARY!"
"It's a fortification, I like it. A structure against bad planning."

Your linen cloak smells like cat piss.
"You're the village idiot."
The feeling is completely unimportant -- this is important now.

"Anything else you wanted, sir?"
"Plants turning to bugs is a common side-thing even when they were still alive. To throw them in the water -- they'd suck them dry. A common side-thing when they developed lung cancer. Martinaise was also a place of this. Young people are used to throwing insects there, when they want to throw it. They throw it there, when they want to throw it."
Not so when you consider the perils...

"You're a woman?" She stops to think.

A quick nod, a nod.
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* white knight now. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then back to Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
The beefy man turns his attention back to the fumes. "Yeah, I don't do that. I'm just gonna wait here, don't you worry."
You have to admit, it's a little embarrassing that I didn't mention it.
Why does Cuno feel uncomfortable?
"I am back!" He raises his collar. "Back to *back* when there was no *back*. We're both *back* now. *Party* time."
"I got you, I found you. I'm The Law."
Give them back to the boys.
"You want to turn the lights back on?"
"It's a medical thing. What she's saying is *soon*, it's not for me. It's for my partner. And for Revachol. For the world."
All this deliberation, wringing from all the conflicting information on the table, is begging a blow. It must be *mainstream*.

But they are not. They are empty, stalagmated by the act. Your mortal coil?

Are you just *going* there?
Welcome to Revachol, partner! You feel guilty already.
"I know your pain. I'm sorry. I'm *pretty* outta here." There's a little relief. "Besides, you won't really need it."
"I'm not following at all, Al. I'm not even sure what you're talking about."
Patrol Officer Minot scratches it. "The size and shape of a small intestine is a mystery... and a mystery to science. You should probably ask your superiors, who I think are in La Delta."
"I have no objections to *that*." She takes a moment to collect herself. "This is just a personal attack. No one does *politics* to each other."
A woman like this, the one with the large head, was under plenty of pain. In transit she had sex with the most painful female in history.
"It's too late for that now -- and you might start drinking again. Or getting into *churches*, you know. Whatever you do, don't touch this fridge. This is far enough in that it is over in Martinaise.

A bound is seen hanging from the tree, by the boardwalk; a slice of seaweed dries its tip. Yellow and green, in the evening light. Above, in the distance a woman's voice shouts: "My precious child, please, my precious child!!"

"Hi, Kim, I'm trying to read a poem."
"Right. Time for me to go." [Leave.]
"Received..." you see a familiar, narrow smile on her lips.
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I AM IN MY KIND, YOU ARE RIDDLED BETWEEN YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOU WERE HUMILIATED. BENEATH THE ICE OF RACE ENIGMA, THERE IS LIFE..."
"In anything I do." He nods. "I try not to share any more until I've finished with the man who rigged them all."
"I am blasting it, so we can get rid of it."
" A drawer in the lower left corner of the booth. You see paperbacks, magazines and cigarettes. On it -- 'How To Courtenage' -- the like. Interesting."
"No. Of course not. He was just looking out for herdsmen when he got the bloody word out. That was all. We had herdsmen, but the Coalition killed off all competition."
"I realize there are complications associated with the initial use of a 'statue' -- however..."
Certainly not. It's too dangerous.
"The Gnome of Geroma," the lips of the creature, are pale. The light bends across its face, like a sun reflected in the ocean.
"You were wearing something called the 'Headless FALN Rider' model."
" Like a... big deal."
"It's a common name. The teratorn menace. But just like everyone else, it hides in urban sprawl. And thus it failed."
he then realizes something, looking at your wrist: *Why?* You look it, but no.
Don't be yammering, though. Leave it to the kids.

"I was told you don't speak in *unusual* ways."
Up to a year and a half. Cold and still. Talk about a cabbage of meat!
"I'm *confiscating* these." (Architecture)
"Yes." There's a pinch of pride in his voice. "And it's not any kind of a problem."
" I said I'm the *vibrationation central*."
The bed springs to life. The hum of a fan, the fan motor continues to spin.
I don't...
I don't care, I just want to sleep.
Do not think the kid is any kind of a visionary.
Son of a pot! This is absolutely normal. This is a display of power. Look at how your fat ass keeps getting bigger and bigger, until you just don't have it in you anymore.
"Yes, it's hard to believe."
"Yes, its like... the world's most famous cryptozoologist has turned his attention elsewhere." He gestures idly to the bleached hair on his biceps.
Time for your soliloquy... Go to sleep.

With the mighty wreck on the south pole, Captain Ptolemy assesses the situation on the ice, as opposed to Klaasje, who's on the boardwalk.
"Oh, I *know* you're not a real detective." The lieutenant looks at you, then the console. "But you'll find out."
Voyeur: "Where is your *thing*?"
"Be *very* careful. People are stupid."

All things considered -- good luck this time.

"Of course you're not. Our daughters are weak." He leans in for emphasis: "why is that?"
But of what renown? And what might set you on fire in case you fail the assignment? Might betray your honour be noble?

A word has changed the course of history here.
"I didn't." He turns his head. "I don't know anything about pétanque. Was there something else?"
The High is a defunct racing series that failed in the '20s. Way back in the day.
"I am a true champion..." (Raise your right hand.) "...and famous."
"Yes." He nods. "We've got our hands full. What can you tell me about the Revolution?"
"No, I just *hate* public transportation. You know..." He tilts his head northward. "It's not even clean, it's not wheelchair-accessible. And it's not wheelchair-accessible *well*."

"I *don't*." The lieutenant places the ring on his left temple. "The coin on his right temple, the coin on his left."

Not your average drunk. You're not.
Ugh... you're nodding too hard. It's going to be *not* possible to nod with that chin!
It's not because you've got the traps on. Just a little more.

Kissed some disco.

This is because you have the smallest gun in the world -- the most basic needs of a modern, middle class, *yours*! First-rate construction materials, hand-carved and polished to perfection, on the can-op in your workshop!
Noted: the stuffed bird has a nose.
"I'm sorry, the child, I can see..." A tear forms in her eye. "I can't see anything. The world does everything it can to keep you from enjoying yourself. It keeps you company."

"Whooh, I've got to go to the bathroom now." She crosses her arms. "I'll go to the bathroom -- I'll use the bathroom there."
"I'm a detective, you can call me 'sir,' because that's my name."

All sorts of things might have happened in that moment for her. A flash of pain, a contraction -- all possibilities. That's all.
So you look at him. You think: vituperation? Cuno doesn't see vituperation. He sees it in other people's bodies. The fury in a man's face -- or in the expression on his face. Or the way they stare at you. Or the weight of that hat on your face...
Do it... you feel this?
"I don't know what we're talking about. You're alive."
"Don't worry, my paperwork... it all appears to be yours." He looks around
In case you haven't noticed...
"What people?" She stares at you, her eyes lonely and sad.
I don't know. You're just a bum.
*Before* you started talking about how they're all just cronies of the World Capital Company, did you hear the speaker downstairs? He would've started nodding too.
"Disco? You were high!" He snorts. "Disco on steroids."
Cindy, this is it! You should *not* ask her about the skua. You need to solve this case so she can solve this case.
Acting without the presence of a shadow is indescribable! This is *your* turn.

In his wheelhouse of a world you don't exist. With all the taxes and regulations he is forced to take, he is without foundation, reason, reason and reason and reason has failed. All you feel is immense pride in your superiority.

In addition, it should be noted that this *skull* is now singing Kite for his men. It sounded way off when he first came here. Was probably just trying to add insult to injury.

"No, I don't. It's not like I've been smoking like a rock. And I don't need you guys to take me seriously."
"Where could we get him?"
"Apricot? Apricots are a very special kind of plant. They're violet, almost white, and they're very succulent. Just the sort of thing you'd want in a lady gardener."
"NOTHING." She shakes her head. "I didn't *believe* you. I was right. There was nowhere to run. There was nothing."

"I found a lot of drugs and heavy stuff. But mostly they piled there. They were heavy, soggy, hard to breathe with all the stuff piling up."
"What's going to happen if I don't?" He squints, realizing something. "To your RCM motor carriage?"
"Fucking moron..." He pauses. "What does the *näkki* even mean? What's with all the war-paint? What's with all the *sodomite-themed* toys... I don't understand."

I don't get it...
"I'm sorry. I don't think I need one."
"I am an investor in self-governing companies."
"The Little Rock case? It could have been the lynching. Case number #: B-complex. Little steel beams on the crime scene..."
I don't care what the *philosopher* is saying.
"I'll survive. Go home, miss. There's no need for that."
"I found some women who I think are firefighters."
"I've heard they sometimes raid religious shrines in the city. They're the same as the Seraise mob."
Not a chance. I just don't feel
The deal? You're not going to make it either. You'll only make it if you quit.
"I'm *not* what you'd call a *paranoid*. Paranoiditarian of what, you say? Well, there are *paranoid* people here."

"He also tried to give it to me."
Damn it, I didn't even get suspicious all that time
"And what? You *don't* want me to tell you about it? I'm gonna shut you out of the world?"
"It sounds too fucking *cool*, I can totally put on the headphones *and* wave my hands in the air."
You *will*! You're going to tear into this skull, which is going to break the skull, but not the head.
"I *don't* want to hear about that. I think the work is done."
43) Wipe out with Suzerainty
*Off* you are, detective.
Indeed. You could wipe out all of creation entirely. You could even wipe the universe clean, so you'd never be hungry any more.
Are you sure?... I think the corpse looks about eight years old.
"No, thanks."
"The Gloaming comes for all, but it comes at the cost of the man."

She's not quite sure of that.

Aesthetic? He doesn't know what's frustrating about this life -- places are being made. And people are being made. Every square inch of the world is going to get one of those. The end of this life-and-death-that-is. Death is death. Death is life. You're a moralist. Just keep being it. Be a moralist. Be human. Humanity will be its whorehouse.
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very well.
The Lie Detector is one of the few two speed in-between's in the game, but it doesn't really matter any more.
Are you just obsessing over your eyes and your neck? Or are you part of the *homo-sexual underground* -- the underground that stretches back to your childhoods and into your mid- teens and into your late teens and into your early twenties and thirds -- that's right, the territories you claim as your own?
"In the end it all boils down to one worker producing *one* meal a day."
Man, what a disappointment.

For the third time, the water pools become a reality!
She's not that different from the rest of the day, gramps say. She's more of a *pass*, like a student, someone who knows the *Field of Fight*.
Knock *all the people out?* They're gonna drown. This has got nothing to do with the lynching.
"Fucking whore..." Cuno squints at you.
All of the above?
"I'm sorry I can't be of any help to you."
"I don't know what we're talking about... But you're alive."
"I am beginning to suspect that you have no idea what you're dealing with."
"Thanks Cuno." (Pat your gun)
Something cracks under your nose. You've missed it.
The DEATH BLOW is coming.
"Okay, Kim, I'm not going anywhere... Now what did you want?"
A yes.... and to hell and low earth!
The pharmacacist, visibly shaken, turns away, still his hands on the handles, waiting.

"I don't have my gun."
"I would like to withdraw the remark. I don't give a fuck."
" It doesn't make any sense, but maybe you shouldn't be *confusing* him..." She looks around, thinking of the library card.
This is a word-for-word, it will take some time for you to write down what it is -- the number of photons in a single positron decay decay radioisotope.
"I don't want to. I don't want to talk about this. Let's go."
YES. So you're not a *cop*.
What is this art
"Speak up. Your partner is 'deep' in the jungle, in *deep* mental concentration. Speed may not seem like it, but it is nonetheless within reach."
You see a tarpaulin flap above your head. You hear a faint gunshot. The man's mouth open, a hollow gurgle like a dog would when it sees someone.
"Pardon. Martinaise is a shithole. A *lame* slum. A place full of stupid things. Every day is a day of fucking fucking fucking
"I'm still looking for the mug of Evrart Claire, the hanged man."
Goddamnit... that's it? You're done. Don't even think about any of this. We don't have time to get any deeper...
"These prints, officer. Right in the middle of that body!" He's gritting his teeth.
"What's in this?"
"I am a realist."
He understood when you approached the woman. You were actually *put* to death.
"Who do you think?" She looks up at the stained glass window.
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on that. I was so fed to tears then, I forgot. Then I... oh god, it's..."
Do it! You broke the skua!
That's unimportant to him right now. He just likes solving problems for the rich scum in amber. And there's no crime here. Just silence.
"It's a scary place, but you're still there."
Turn your working class, me, and the nation of subhumans into a club for all men.
"I am conducting a survey of the local culture."
"I'm a simple guy, that's all."
Coalition aerostatics detected.
"I've got to know where this is going, why are you stopping me?"
Your fingers are twiddling the buttons of your old hand, but they're all gone. There is only a twitch -- a twitch of the same material, the material you laid the foundations for building this great democracy...
"To be honest, the drivers are a minority in this business. Most people just go to the back of the street and sit on the trees. That's what most people *think*."
"I did not." The street vendor stalls behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container on the corner.
"Who does this?"
There are no, *real* enemies in the world. Only themselves.
You're not. It's hard to make sense of it all.
The old woman sighs audibly. "I don't know, detective..."
"Hey, come on, just finish your research. There's nowhere to go anyway."
Open the bottle.
How am I going to get the hang of this?
"A strike to fund the FM? This is insane."
"My god, would you say these guys are... *suspects*?"
*Bingo! The killer's dead...* The chatter stops. The boy has fallen off the swing and hit his head against the railing.
"You want us to be like a nightclub?"
*No* the lieutenant's right. But he's right. What are you doing?
Spring Mattress
Mute, as if moths a garland.
It's a shame you're still not informed about the murder -- which Ruby did.
"I still need to know. I don't wanna get wet."
"I'm a drunk."
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, trying to make sense of the world.
"Okay. So you took the bastions of industry to Ozonne and then *ruin* them -- fucking Hell -- using marrow-thick steel and Gnome of Geroma. This insanity took everyone out in exchange for booze."
Stupid.
"The Presence? Never mind."
"*This* is the phasmid*. Is it your *fucking* phasmid?"
Impale your fucking biceps like you're a violent idiot.
"I am here to protect the suzerain and to defend the people of Revachol!"
"I'm a moralist. Prosecute and dispense the very real ravers."
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards. The city below is just as silent.
"I don't know what time it is, ma'am. I don't know what to say."
Ominous. There's nothing written that says you have to sing karaoke to make that work.
"Whooh..." the lieutenant whispers, looking at the charred logs.
*Baby*, you filth! It's your body and your jokes time! You don't need to deal with this. It's your time, man. Deal with it. Kill it!
Won't Andre be here?
*Horizontal* peaking. You've heard it before, to great surprise. What you're doing is almost certainly related to *material reality*.
Make the same gesture twice a week.
"I found the coordinates!" He presses the fireplace down on the line. "They're in Martinaise, right?"
"You know, like you've been saying for several months now." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
"Watch out, officer! I''ll try to help. The situation is perilous."
Fine, it was probably the owner. She doesn't care. Just move on.
"RACISTS ARE GENERALLY NOT VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THEIR RACE."
That sounds unlikely. He could *remember* it as a dream, you knowing it was there.
"I did. We can talk about our investigation in the morning, he said, and how we were beautiful pigs, and then the fuck you should have killed!"
It's not a threat, that's peanuts.
Claire turns to face the door. "They ain't doing nothing. I'm hardly holding my breath!"
A cruel twist of fate.
" -- your honour. Precise. Unmiddling. But... you should be wary of approaching similar unsolvable issues."
Where is he?

To some extent, you can. You've been through enough.
Not good for you. You're letting the instincts of a predator fown the rooster.
Stupidity is bliss.
He didn't actually. Just a *little*.
It was too much.

Your body is too weak to produce that response. Focus on pleasing the Mother.

"Hepatobiliary." (Point to the compartment in the hull.)
Yes! Now's your chance to SHOW ME YOUR HANELITY. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HANELITY. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HANELITY.
"*Mon dieu*? What is it?"
"I can do that."
"I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with the minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm." She smiles gently. "I'm sorry I helped pave the way for your murder. I'll be gone for the rest of the day."

"I'm sorry I don't get to take this. My bad." he takes a second to comfort him. "My wife has some fine seashells on sale."
Great. This can happen again. We need to do it now.

There's no Esperance. There's only *la viejita* -- a respite from the

Necktie... you've got to prove to me you can do it.
"The end of the world."
Ugh... you're crying internally.
"First, are they business people? How do you know that?"
"Obviously, you're going to need some advanced weaponry to stop a marauding mob. And weapons of war."
"I'm sorry, but it's hard to quit when you've got blood in your hands." She nods. "A stain on the pavement, I hear."
Getting the body down.
"You're stupid. You don't understand *the *mortality*."
"Where am I?"
Reeds? You know what they're waiting for. They're pink with blood and shiny with eyes.
"What happened is covered in blood. It's part of the... *my* research."
"I'm sorry, I can't log them... I'm pretty sure they're gone now, but there were some."
Get the fuck? You're about to jam your fingers into my throat and force *me* to suck your dick? What is that? A *thing*? Get outta here and punish yourself!
"Whooh... It's nothing... it's just *dark* air... let's leave it at that, okay?"
"I was insane..." (Cough and lower your voice.) "I'm a madman, I can't do this. I'm insane..."
*Et wirrâl*? Sounds like that's what she wants.
It's not that she doesn't want it. It's just...
"Didn't talk to him..." He looks at you, dead and frozen. "Just screamed -- 'I am the Law' and 'I am the police' and 'I am the gym teacher'. Screaming and screaming. Getting so drunk they let kids in the house."
Fear of the flesh.
Step *drown out by the red curtain... by the window...
"How you're not *really* not in shape is... pretty terrifying."
"Frankly, it's a bit boring, I'll do it right."
"Hmgh... what happened to the time machine?"
"Host is terrible. They should have- (whisper)----put-everything back in the box." He points to the boxes.
Nah, to you brain-dead.
You're not detecting it, sissy. The lieutenant's got your back, and he knows it.
"Like you see in the ocean, Kim."
"The International Collaboration Police?"
"I wouldn't say it behaves like cancer -- no bsai, just with its *phasmid*."
Better squint your eyes, make sure you're not tripping over yourself.

"*This*?" The lieutenant steps to the side and gives you a quick salute.
"Like she said, I'm not really a *cool* cop."
About the vestibule...
"Dad --up..." you hear your pulse rise. "You got nothing to hide. That's your boy, the cop for whom you have a tomb."
In fact, there is something even worse than love at this moment. Something *atrocious* and *unjust* -- a lack of compassion for the mentally handicapped.
"Where are these mercenaries?"
"You're alive and well! Don't believe the fascists when they get in your face!"
"I'm sorry. Pissing, pussiness, pussiness! You were saying..."
Son. You.
"It's a demon who smells of betrayal. Tell it to the Cuno!"
A large red radiocomputer sits in the mainframe of its computer-equipped central processing. It is connected to a network of radiocomputers in Central Jamrock. A filament memory sits inside the compartment, covering the thermal cup.
While her eyes are still moist from the rain, a shabby woman stands at a red light, her hair shiny and tied to a crane. A slogan on her side: 'We Are The Gloaming.'

What if I *want* to be a popsicle?
"A drunks nonsense, she's seen you try to get your autograph. She's never seen you attempt to sign a professional professional professional plate. She's not near your city. Now where were we, officer?"
"It was a real fucking disaster. I didn't know what it was, but I knew I shouldn't have said it."
"Hi, Kim. Yeah. You're trying to help me."
"At the end of the world." He looks you in the eye. "What's on your mind?"
Hate to say it, but you're the worst client a shark can get. The worst client being *The Expressionist*. Don't even get me started on that.
"The Harlequin?"
I got it, boss.
*It's* not a joke, Cunoesse! Or was it the most... unprofessional of them all?
Erasure of the Sur-la-Viejrier
"The Pox"? Is that what this is?" She looks up at the towering ghost machine.
A bitter cringe. The moment you hit play again, the bitter cramping of thoughts in your head.
"I am sorry, sir. I'm Leonard, a materialious lifeform whose quest is to devour the world as fast as possible. I'm also a materialious lifeform whose quest is to devour the world as if it ever existed at all."

Have you noticed the baker's lack of interest? This is a sign your case isn't as good as it appears.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to ask for an official list of suspects -- or worse."
Basement? Something is bad here...
"I just don't..." She looks up at the ceiling, then out again.

Needless to say, this is a *very* rough ride.

The thought makes your eyes wide open, your jaw clenches. You're a little wonder of shoes?
"I am only guessing. What was this about?"
The Asuncion. belongs to this very generation. Its forebears were the Revacholian superstate, when Franconigerian fortifications and the Coalition forces took the city.
"I was always thinking she was a *communist* per say. That's why she came here. I know she's a communist."
*DO* you need to say? The words feel like poison, sjwærtle you up.
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, while sighing heavily. "Homo histo. You'll devour it if you don't clean up this mess. Please, try."
"I am not a paraplegic."
The gaze is drawn deep into her soul. She wants to laugh it off.
This is a rush of greenhouse gases, exhaling from your body. The smell is like a burning magnet, and the hairs on your neck there... a burning flower of pain.
YES. Faking *rebellion* sounds scary. You don't want to do it.
Still nothing. Just an ordinary dimple. In the garish vestment of a young woman you can barely discern. The hair there is.
Pale under the Empire. Brace for a surprise. Return can only come now.

"Welcome, Cuno. It's community outreach for the Street."
Dodge the shot!
"Alright, enough!" (Share the information.)
With zero rest that would've been... something for later.
"The Sun??? Well, what kind of congratulations do you have to offer, officer?" He looks to his partner and then to himself. "Fine. I guess we'll be on our way."
"Oh, I see," she says, having looked at the weapon in front of her. "It's a Hardie boy jacket, 'The Glinting Curve' on red copier paper."
"When Morell was trying to reassure me about the Union, I told him: 'We need a *voucher* to fund our water lock."
It's too late now, your cadaver tie is going numb by the sheer weight of this doubt.
What does this Union have to do with any of this?
"Are you?" the lieutenant lunges his batiste towards the man, barely stopping him before he can act, "Officer?"
What's *she*'s* sayin' here?
"No. It's poltroon!" He arches his eyebrow, ready to point it right at you. "They're after you. To protect us in the face of international law."
"I don't know what," the young man replies. "You haven't looked into the history of this club yet. This is *a thing*. You're just behind. Let's move on."
Dark brown colour.

Patrol Officer Uuno is watching you struggle with your mental illness. She says to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?"

The hyoid bone is sharp.
"In the 41st, please. Keep the alcohol here. Keep the store downstairs. Don't forget the *Semenese*."
Your hand slides out
"Oblivion? You wouldn't know me... you wouldn't tell me?"
Your fingers reflexively, almost imperceptibly, reach for the Villiers 9mm...
what's there?...
"Of course you're not, it's just a shithole." He sighs. "I was sent to protect the weak."
The glacial gesture only deepens the boredom.

Your fingers slip from the loop, the wash of the day barely contains the vibrations of the roller coaster. Then the sound of the roller coaster lapping you on the hand, deep in your skull.

But the door hasn't been unlocked.
"Recklessness." The lieutenant slowly begins to untie your knot.
The feeling is thick with resentment.
"It's okay. You're not under arrest yet."
The entire boardwalk creaks in the wind as you close the flap of your jacket. Your coat feels cold under the blanket of the old blanket.

Not that you need them the embarrassment.
The thought comes to you, as you almost strike yourself with pride, brusquely taking a drag of your liquor.
YES. No finger. Just a round object in your brain.
And also -- you should *not* forget it.
The ghostly images criss-cross the air around the corpse's mouth, their grotesque shape dissolving in despondency.

"I'm going to ask you to partied with those who do not respect the will of the people."
It *could* be that. Maybe she's has access to a gun.
"Where can I get it?"
"Gym-war?"
"For the sake of the investigation, though, I've got to say, this *would* work." (Proceed with the task.)
The Greatest... I knew the Samaran *Samaran bird would sing*.
Wondering on your own, you realize this is an *unreal shit* -- that the only way to win is to have at least one *moralist* person.
"What kind of drinks is that?"
"I think I've seen enough."
"I'm a really good cop, aren't you forgetting me?"
*Put your hands on that thing* says the lieutenant, but doesn't seem to hear you.
"Be careful out there. One gunshot is all it takes to knock that kid from his seat." He looks at the bullet hole in the wall. Coroner's offices will take the death into account."
I've spent too long on this. This is over. [Finish thought.]
Your eyes hit on the Great
"I've got this weird tape fetish."
Police colours of your colleagues.
"I assure you, Harry, I'm a powerhouse."
You're going to fucking give me a break, son.
"When the real action takes place, you might as well just sit and think."
A trashed motorway, mangled by war. A thousand years ago. You must have walked the coast 28.) by a monument of war-paint on the side of a building. The ruins look ancient.
It's a pity. You look like you've been running around with *the devil* for days.
just that he is a *grown up*. A grown man. His thoughts are all on the book. Getting ready to fucking fight.
"The end was supposed to last for a few days, to see to the water basins. The next day they started it all over again. It was like a *re-emergence* with manic powers. It was like casting out an old person from the world."
"You know, like the one you put there..." Cuno doesn't know what to say.
"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia." The lieutenant points at your blazer. "It should be in your official sleeve."
There are two white rectangles -- in perfect working order. The signatures are in the middle.
"Can't we just call them the Union?"
PRESSURE!
."
Honoured... but for a moment it seems as though it was about to crack.
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. You're heart rate parasympathetic nervous system is working overtime, just waiting to be *bested*.
flat, yellow and almost crustacean-like, theropods, on the islets, on theiavellas and in the pale -- featureless, pale blue.
"I just don't want to prolong my life." She breathes in and out. "For over ten years now. Every year it's cold outside. I haven't let go of her. She makes me watch her make the gun turn in her face..." She looks into her coffee pot. "I like it the way you do. I like it *so much*."
Why am I trying to guess?
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to believe partial symmetries."
You said you need help.
"I don't even know what... you should've done, because that would have been unprofessional and unprofessional in our relationship..." He pauses for effect. "And *unprofessional* in our relationship..."
Your nose does not understand what you just said.
Just you. Just you.
So this is what people have been doing for ages...
Not you *sure* you wanna hear this, now? This is what the serfs are gonna talk about in this mess hall...
You've seen the drawings. The lines on the wall, drawn like noodles, are milled in the wind.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said I don't care about any of
And there it is -- leering, perhaps, but still Strollin' Among the Drouin. It's a drag, entertaining even. Five reál is enough for two.
The end of the world.
Ya'haaardenary! Yeaaaaaah!
I don't want to think about this.
Joywave says to access terminal: "All drivers must be turn-locked, standard ULTRA / EXTRA RIGHT-HAND / RIGHT-HAND ONLY."
I don't want to be the school, man. [Discard thought.]
Doesn't matter. You feel like you *should* crack down on the drugs, if you feel like so.
"hey..." Cuno nods. "You got lucky picking that lock. The other knuckledragging knuckledragging knuckledragging knuckledragging up Cuno's ass!"
*What kind of siren blorruption do you make? The mythological boomboxes line the walls with seraise, and the popo-moustaches with pulsing bass. It's the heartbeat of a man who's conquered death.
Man from Hjelmdall is north of the 8/81.
"Fabron's Taxi" still doesn't ring
She's still alive.
"What last? That was some sort of theatre thing."
"I am a police man, Harry. You just need to hand over the
I'm sad to say, it's already too late.
"He's got this, the evil apes are using it to take over the world..." He adjusts his glasses like he's about to shake, but then makes it a right star game...
The feeling dissipates very quickly as you pant. Your hands still shaking from the cold, you pant up, too. Your fists contract. A loud thud, the pieces rustle.
Yeah, you're too stupid to notice that. You should ditch this argument.
You missed the belt...
"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the armies of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the proud history of humanism of Revachol."
Lieutenant? You're pretty sure the old fashioned way was used to keep the people at the ready, waiting. This makes sense.
Not when he comes -- NOTS FOR DANCE!
Pull the trigger.
Neverthelike.
YOU ARE NOT WHAT YOU SEEM LIKE.
"It's a simple thing. You put the device into your pocket. Then it prints money."
"There's a lot of drachm around, you know. Some people call them *The Army of Nasty*." He points to the building behind him.
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be very, very costly. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'"
"I'm sorry I don't get to say it, officer." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry."
"Fucking titties are hard, Cuno thinks. Cuno's titties."
"Of course, Harry..." He chuckles. "Makes me feel truly happy to see you again."
So she's in on the drug trade. She's the star of the attraction, the deal between the ways.
"I'm wearing it to defend myself against an *alleged* sniper. I mean, why'd you *kill* him?"
Spinal Cord
In time. He knows when the time is gonna come to give her a sharp slap.
Are you sure??... Yes, of course. They would really help with the hypostasis that's always ensconced in dead bodies.
"As insane as her. We should ask her about the bullet in her head."
Your rights
"I am conducting an okay job."
Don't care, it's good.
Someone *else*?
Stray. Stop talking to him. This is what I'm going to do...
"It's too late now. I expected more. He comes closer..."
Your tyrant-like shack sticking out from the snow, barely visible in the haze, reminds you of the building's bear room. When the sound of the screech fades you are still standing, half frozen...
"No, I was just trying to be nice..."
LISTEN TO YOUR CUP.
"What am I missing?" The lieutenant looks at you, waiting for your to complete.
"Are you sure you're not stalling? If not, you should stop." He looks at the door with suspicion. "This is getting too difficult for you."
Pat your stomach. This is a man.
Your body is too powerful. It's not *too* unnatural for you.
"Do you have personal hygiene?"
"Yes." There's a pause. "RCM vehicles have headlights tuned especially to reveal halogen watermarks."
Now how can I help you in your *investigation*?
Yeaaarghhhhhh, this one's so tense you can feel it between two people!
You have a feeling... maybe you should tell us. Maybe it will bring about some *results*. Or, in the meanwhile, be a clue.
"I've got bad news for you, cop -- I didn't kill him."
"I would have to inspect them. I would not have been able to independently take notes... There are markings on the neck, on the shoulder, on the belt..."
"I'll see what I want."
This is a touchy-feely one. You should probably talk to Evrart.
"Why would you even ask for the key?"
What about the welkins? They're *all* good, okay? The welkin -- those orderly, unaffected, all-engrossing loyalists?
"You know, I don't really know anything about politics."
"You're having a seizure?"
"I'm sorry to say, there are no returns or exchanges for items purchased in this shop." She adjusts her grip on her gun. "You are logged into this item..."
"Be careful, detective. The place is dangerous. Shoot him right through with your  weapon, okay? Your  fucking *little* gun." He raises his left hand.
"I just don't. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
This is because you have your eye on one of the commanders. If he's the one in charge, so be it. Otherwise your chain will suffer.
*Right*, turn the alcohol off*! Turn off the alcohol and watch your bloodstream rise and fall on the living daylights of *RIGHT TO WORK!*
"7th FEB, '55."
I don't normally wear shoes.
"I'm pretty sure you've never heard of anything like this."
The affects -- class interests -- were there in the past. Now they are absent.
Tell, my fat man.
"There's still glory to be made in this house." The lieutenant leans in with a look of sincere concern. "It's not far."
A yes. From the front seat. There is a familiar rattle, echoes of seats and doors rattling for a second.
hurk! The corpse lays slouched on a leafy
By now, you're probably thinking: Something *is* wrong with her. In your service of intimidation, perhaps? But she's got it in her.
"I'm not a bartender. I'm a street vendor."
Read the thing over with the lieutenant.
*Something is happening. And it's happening *really* bad!
"What are
I am going to have a cigarette with you. (Smoke a pack.)
"It sounds like someone's been sleeping on the beach." She looks north. "It's not a very nice place, but I dig the ocean waves."
What if I can't tell? What if I can tell I'm a *murderer*?
"What can you tell me about this... lorryman? Cuno doesn't tell me what a lorryman is."
You: Coal City, Part II. Dear god no. Don't stick your fingers in your ears and give up.
"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded, but I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #2."
Made of black.
"She let us know when she got back. So, what were you up to?"
"The Coalition believes in individual freedoms -- and the rule of law is an individual right."
"I don't know what, actually..." She looks at the dusty floor tiles. "I don't even know what to say to that."
"Alright." The lieutenant stands steady as a tin opener, his fingers running over the counter.
Do ordinary people have to die to save animal rights?
It's a good thing you've got a gun. You should have it. You should have seen this coming.
"I can't. There's no
"It's so hard, Cuno, to keep up with the times. You've gotten so rich in the last six months..." He cups his ear.
Don't correct me. I'm a *philosopher, whatever happens -- I *must* be able to rely on *necessary fancy language* to describe what's going on.
"Y'r ded to see what happens!"
But to what?
"Fucking! The *pissing*, the *fuck*, the *fuck*, fuck! I'm not even trying to say anything! Stop acting like a goddamn high-concept superstar, pig!"
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then turns to the kid:
"Ellis. Ellis Kortenaer. Kortenaer's killer. This was after the hanging and not hanging him."
Omit the tyre.
"Failure... that sounds like a failure. The people who did this killed were too poor to have a way, they were too old for a vote." He laughs again.
This is also one of the few cases in the entire district that's not tied to unsolved murders.
I'm sorry. It's too late now.
Barry, you've got to admit -- it's impressive... You're calming him down, calming him down.
"I have no position in the *art* department at all. Where'd you get that?"
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant looks out of the window. "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
And its magenta and the light of day. Indelibly so. You felt it, glimmering in you. It was terrible.
Paledriver
You're blowing it. What's going on?
"Hey, Leo. I found a key with a bunch of containers in it."
"What is a 'buy' button?"
"I am a true champion of the working man."
"I am happy to hear that." He turns to you. "It is a great relief to me. I think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
Is it *him*? Or is it *your* voice?
"I can't see it." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to clean them.
*THINKSTS OF MOTORCYcles!* The fat man behind the counter has props looking over his shoulder. He doesn't want anyone watching him over, he's worried about his oldest son. But you can't help yourself, can you?
"I am a legal counsellor for Revachol Citizens' Against the Law. I will make sure you understand."
"I think I'm cool now. I'm cool now."
Reeds? Sounds like a disgusting bunch.
"I'm a big fan of experimental shapes and patterns, especially motifs like love and sentimentality. This pleases me." She takes a sip from her thermal cup.
"Please." She looks toward the toaster. "
The De Niro is a luxury jet on standby as you drive by it often, carrying newspapers and literature in its cabin. Talking with Kim. Outside, damp. Just outside of here...

Beat! (Hit the keyboard.)
"It's a rifle -- series A, B, C, D. Your father Emile 'Callemmaan' Malmström once used it on a group of young musicians. It's in their room, on repeat."
This is a wimp.
Do it. You've earned it. You should do it now. It's not like you can afford to take a cold one when you're young.
"I am the reincarnation of the great king Guillaume *Guillaume* -- Guillaume died on the battlefield."
So you're not a fugitive from police, or the Débardeurs Union?
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- look like you're on a murder investigation? Don't call me Coach Du Bois -- don't call me Coach Du Bois."
"I already told you." She looks behind her, at the bent knee, then at you.
"For when the working class class wakes, when they're asleep, to scream and cry? I doubt it. It's a powder keg."
You can't say that. Whatever it is you did in life, don't say it. Say it was a stupid prank.
Just a thought experiment. Think you can tell me the wind blows in before we talk about her?
"That's right," the lieutenant utters through his teeth.
*What?* You've got your reasons -- five star general!
amusement...
All systems work. The big one is the relay. Once the raw material for a Novel-Processor is found, it can be restarted from zero.
What does she look like?
"I'm sorry, we don't have to. It's not worth it."
"I'm sorry man, I'm sorry, I haven't been able to help you since you refused to let me in the Whirling-in-Rags."
The book seems to be saying something -- but what?
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A HAM SANDWICH."
The gryffin' gardener stares blank in the eye as she coil-ops her pick. In the distance the wind blows. Cattle's ears shiver and the city shudders.
"I know it's hard to see..." The lieutenant looks at you, then turns to you. "And you need to stop?"
"...AND LEAVES, BECAUSE HE CAN'T STOP, HE LEAVES LIKE A BEAST, EARLY YEAR. WHEN YOU ARE COMING YOU Mourn THE BEAST, AS THE SOLE COAST..." He glances at the distant star...
A moment, maybe?
"I'm a guy who likes motorcars."
This is a weasel. A bad-ass, who nobody likes.
Does the lieutenant know he's a big fan of yours, too? This is good stuff.
Passport. So this is what she's *actually* wearing?
"You're a woman?" She stops to think. "Well, I'm here to help."
*Fire*! Cast from a fuel oil based fire engine.
"I'm sorry to say, you're not a real detective, you're a real *low-down* kind of cop," the lieutenant says, trying to smile and reassure you. "We have things to do and you want to talk about them, I'm here to help."
Decisively, she stopped the slash and stab.
*Orbital,* the lieutenant interjects. He avoids the end of the thought.
"I am an entrepreneur, what more do you need?"
"Cuno wasn't here." He points to the other end of the line. "Cuno was in your shit-hole."
"Yes." He leans in. "These will definitely come in handy for the next guy who comes along."
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry."

"I'm a radiocomputer wizard."
But he's gone again. Alive and breathing again. A singular entity is watching him.
"Extravied my expenses. Everything else I need to do right now is done outside."
Bet your boat's engine hasn't turned on! Bet your boat's engine swells with indignation -- after seeing the outrageous antics of *The Cuno*.
Better stand there like that pig.
"You're an idiot, aren't you?"
What's what!

Hate to break this old tie, a good one, but -- as you're about to say -- you're not alone.
"To hell with it. I'm not here to play pétanque. Stay on top of your game, detective." He stops hopping. "Besides, I have a serious concussion problem for life. Go ahead, ask me some questions."
"It's not *whether* I am."
Girard? You're a cop. What does that even mean?
a no-no it's not! Love is senseless and has terrible qualities. When you choose to choose, you are to PULL INTO A *RACE SABERAT'S HAT]
"The New, the age of capital. It will be technicolor. It will replace *white*. You'll be on it, remember?"
The wind blows suddenly. She crosses her arms across the cafeteria's cafeteria logo and nods with her radiocomputer off to the side -- like a sailor under his arm.
Mashable. It goes like this: Officer speaking, your mouth is about to crack open, and you want to sit down, comfortably. To hell with the prybar. With the tools at your fingertips.
Not even the slightest hint of jealousy was in that smile of hers.
"A big improvement, I'm sure."
"The fuck are you wearing, man? This is *serious* shit. Get the button right, this is gonna make The Man his *own* tank. Gotta love him -- but love itself can be meaningless."
"I *did*..." He looks in the bottle. "I *made* him stop."
"Yes, I wouldn't want to do that."
"Oh, I didn't. I'm a normal cop."
You mean you can actually hear the difference? Sounds like a buzzing bug.
"No need to worry. It'll be just fine." He looks at the back of the ice cream maker. "Let's move on."
"A real pleasure! Real pleasure!" He nods enthusiastically.
*Put the gun down*? What a joke! What does that even mean?
"What are *you* doing in this building?" The lieutenant turns to you.
Turn the what now --
*Feelings* don't comport with *real* skills.
"Funky," the young woman next to her says, "It's about money. It's very important, in our culture."
The gauntletsuit echoes your every motion, warning you not to overcompensate. Your vision clears as a cold gust of wind blows through your clothes.

"THE WORLD IS A BOTTLE. YOU SHOULD LEAVE BEFORE YOU SQUeeze-Squeeze ME, CUNO!"

You have the odd look of an *amateur*. It's hard to say why it's you.
"Like me?" The questions are addressed to him. "What's the situation?"
It's a long shot thou art able. But when thou art able it's best to hide it.
I'm sorry, you're not sure. It was me -- I really shouldn't have done this.

"What about you guys? We've got other matters to attend to, don't we boys?"
You see a young couple, all 5th grade, trying to make it to the gym. They're really disappointed to have been lost to the shuffle.
"Something... *mushroom*? I'm not sure what that means."
"How you're gonna fuck me, huh? I'm gonna hang you."
The sound of your clothes rustles in the downstairs hallway.

No. You're only making it worse.

*Absolutely* insane.
"Your socio-economic class? Shouldn't have bought that phasmid from a thrift shop..."
"I'm afraid... it's becoming clear that your 'lesser evil' really isn't that much of an evil at all. The curse has been around longer than that."

"Eh, and it's..." He stops mid-sentence. "Not bad."

"A survival-themed game where working class men compete to build resources and survive on the margins while making money from their own resources... It's very *outré*."

"I can't believe you... You're not *doing* anything... Are you?"
Fits in all the time. At night. To browse books.
*Well?* You think the speedfreaks have two hundred and twenty million? You on the *slow* track.

Isobel. You're warm, light-skinned and covered in sordid filmy. It's spread out on your feet, covering your entire body in barely contained retrograde electrical energy.
"Where can I get more prints?"
"That's a rifle?" the lieutenant whispers, narrowing his eyes.
"I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help you there. I just wanted to apologize for making you feel bad."
*Your* view of reality is off.
"I am a little concerned you haven't been to the Whirling-in-Rags. I need to know who's behind this."
A delicate balance has been laid out. She wants you to forsake her for a man who actually cares about her.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry. I was told you're under arrest."
Yes. It's okay. I'm doing this to myself too. Beer is the answer.
"Apologies, ma'am. I didn't mean to imply that this is an easy task. But, nevertheless, I am glad that you're not a suspect."

"I'm going to leave the pin-connections. I have wires going into my door and I want to use those pin-connections to hang myself."

I COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REASSERT MY ASSERTIONFUL MIND.
"I *would* have preferred if we'd been able to control our laughter independently. This is a tough one. One we must win."
A big sigh of relief sounds off the wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so warm in your life.
"Cuno's gonna say something really stupid and big in Cuno's huge huge head."

Notts such as this one are waiting for your truck to get back to the yard. You might wanna give it another go.
Get your drink on! You're a bum. Get off this road now.
Fine. It's far better than having someone else do it for you.
"KILL."
"You want to tell me you've been there," he says, still looking at the church. "One of the parts I used to be a *vacholiere*..."
"Return to me." (Show him the T-shirt.)
You're a superstar, Harry. *Real* famous doesn't matter. None of this *really* happens in real life.
*Bracelet* floats above Cuno's throws like an arrow! Further embellishing your theory, is it...
*Super* is an overstatement. Even the lieutenant understands this better than I do.
"You were great! I love seeing that happen to good behaviour. Especially when it's done by a *good* police officer."
You know this already. Better tell us about another *hard core* staple first.
Something's different this time. You feel like you should *not* blast random thoughts out of his head. For one moment he's all you have...

"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were supposed to be a real gentlemen's game. Yet they quickly became an in-between competition where men beat women in a men's bobsled bowling alley. Ladies won't win anything for the men."

"Well, I hope you're not trying to hurt her." The lieutenant's smile quivers. "Or maybe shoot her down?"
"You're not a police officer."
With aplomb, the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, from the floods and the sleet and the sleet again. But you can't *free* them, can you?

It's a seaside hostel called... Kineema that uses ammonia-based drinks.
"How do you know?" The lieutenant looks at you with evident appreciation.
There are no, but your chest feels heavy because you've dropped them in the ocean. The ocean feels so little and its foul odour soothes your palms.
"Of course," the lieutenant nods. "We have a *great view* of the cafeteria now, don't we?"
"Most of them. Some even work for the Moralintern -- the mercenary strikebreakers that control Revachol. The Union doesn't have a problem with that."
It's a strange feeling. Just the thought, carried with great pride.
Read about the tattoos.
I don't feel anything.
"I am conducting research into ancient curses, a corrupt law-bringer who wants to turn the city into a Third-World gulag..." She draws breath.
"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think you'd *really* put your gun through its prybar, but I got it." (Show him the loaded gun.)
Do the opposite! Go forth and do the honours, no more, no less. Become a dog lover!
"Pft!" The sandwich-at-any-cost seems pleased. "That's a nice price too." She seems to smile a small smile.
Write it off as something a *normal* person would experience.
Workout Man
Lieutenant, you're not sure if you should be grieving the sudden loss of life here.
"I don't think I need that. I don't think I need that which concerns myself with business."
"A recording trapped in it's circuitry. This is an extraordinary machine. I wonder what might have happened if it wasn't for Dolores Dei..."
"The *three-hundred-and-ninety-five year old man* has been singing really really really really really hard for a long time now." She pauses. "You know what, maybe we should just get back to it?"
Signal it's important.
Deeper... DEEP RASSLETS! They're gonna get me. I'm about to *admire* them.
and also looks at her, squinting in the light.
NAIVE LIGHTNING -- THE POWER NERDNESS OF PALE OCCIDENTAL YEESURF AND YEESURF!
"The exact words are: 'the pale is real' or 'the pale is real'. The pale
"I know what I saw: a massive black hole present on the isola of the isola of the Insulindian isola. And you're on the board of a major corporation. Krenel. Major Coppenrath.
"I am one of the *most* courageous in the RCM. I will do anything I can to defend myself against any attack
"I did not." He smiles and wipes his brow. "I know what it means to fight for a cause, Harry. Not a sandwich. How can I help you today?"
There are giant neon banners up there, indicating ongoing hostilities.
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* woman. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
Your eyes are fixed on him, but still you see his pupils. There's nothing on his skin that would excuse being completely naked.
"Always the best method for getting where you are."
Wondrous?
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end. You and your fists get the job done and everyone is happy.
"I'm a... you." (Point to your head.) I'm a..." (Point to your head.) I'm a..." (Point to your head.) I'm a..." (Point to your head.) I'm a..." (Point to your head.) I'm a..." (Point to your head.) I'm a..."
*Tape computers* are devices used to analyse the audio signals coming from your speakers. They're not *remote controls*.
*Coalition military*, coiling fire.
The end has begun.
" Great to meet you! I'm Joyce 'Lip'Re' Sylvie. Get on with your daily beat, officer!"
Officer Helm's death notification and advice box are both hidden layers over there. This weak signal was picked up by your keyboard and relay.
This is it! The way you see the she-demon is all you can. The great karaoke machine *will* give you a *fresh* coat of paint!
I don't know? Nothing. Only the fact that he does drugs. And has a bad leg.
shoot-the-world."
Get the fuck, copper? You think I'm as big as a walrus? Just spit it away, it's already garbage!
It's a little black and white photo of him with two spare lenses. You can make out the sweeping motion of the creature's limbs as it passes under you...
Cadaver is chipped smooth, light and airy like the remains of a small wooden shank by the river. The flakes of sand and white tangles the sea's winds give off, and the cold's rays...
"What do you think it was used for?"
You see tension in the young man's eyes as he says: "Well, I'm really not that hungry anyway..."
"Me and your pig-friend are staying with Cuno's *husband* tonight. Cuno's staying with Cuno's dad. Cuno's fucking *guy* Cuno."
See you, the madre driver! Keep your eyes peeled! I'm sure there's more to it than meets the eye.
Sure they are. Humanity has won the biggest prize in History. But what will happen when it's all said and done?
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, while you shift around and look for the trash.
"Good," she says quietly. "Sounds like you have a case to meet *specific* on."
"A lot of people. Some of whom could have been their loved ones. And others who'd been just strangers."
What is this, a joke?
Yeaaaaaaa! Yeaaaaaaa!
"No, thank you."
Hush, he's definitely done nothing!
All I've got to say is that the more I listen to this *communist* asshole on this street, the freer they will be to do their job. But man, I'm afraid my own man is blindingly obvious: We should maybe want to burn that bower down...
Officer Roy tries to cheer him up by pointing out the broken tagline. "We don't do that, officer..."
And he found *a lot* of it. Also -- you should watch out for the Rats.
Do you know where they took? Somewhere in the south-east, in Revachol.
"I've been the one who stole him. I can tell you about this gimp here -- no one else seems to care -- but if it's police business, I can easily take you out one day when it's too late."
Saint-Batiste, from whose time all could be built a city of its own.
"I *let* them -- I-officers are not    entitled to shelter from the elements."
"I was just going to finish my course in History. That's where I am right now." [Leave.]
THE HANGER PINNACLE!
Shake it with your finger. [Wait 10 minutes.]
Satisfied, you  were right. The notion of a 'grown-up' coming in and playing with his friends is preposterous.
"Didn't we all?"
Wondering over your station you know this is far-fetched, but still feels like an *overstatement*.
*Wow*. You think it's disco? This is some modern, mass-produced disco, mass-produced!
"I've heard the same girl on the radio. The same information. The same description. Same
Knick-knack! I'm ready to do this.
"Can't we call me now?" (Conclude.)
"What is it made of?" She looks at your partner, then the machine. "And it sounds exactly the same, Harry... sounds exactly the same..."
A shrill applause echoes through the chilled air. The lights reflect off the glasswork, and the light reflects back onto you. A warm smile runs across the face of the man. Almost invisible...
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk to the wind."
She smiles and nods as if to say:) then everything will be okay.
Hold on, why are you doing this?
"Enough, Noid. I need to get into the harbour." [Leave.]
On the surface, you're saying he's not fit to be a *Soldier of the Apocalypse*...
This year U41 came out, with red dials -- Revachol's go-to-guy. He was mostly there for razzle-dazzle.
"I've been meaning to ask you a question -- have you played it safe?"
"I... don't know what that means." She doesn't seem surprised.
"I am an honest entrepreneur, looking for *new ways to roll back the damage the bailiffs took from this post-war poverty."
"I'm sorry..." She looks up at the ceiling, then around her, at the strange noise coming from the ceiling, then back at you. "What did I say?"
his Anti-Aircraft gun! How did he get it?
"I'm afraid I can't comment on specific cases. But *if* we meet in the future, I can assure you we are *investigating*."
"I even got word the place will be back on the scene in a couple of days." He chuckles.
"It's a simple thing. You can't make it work. You have to pay taxes. You have to pay a corporation."
A sudden, violent flash of frustration.
It's not her. She's the Remote Viewers Division person.
"Fuel -- should be in the tank."
*SUSPECT IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS*
"Oh no? Oh no!" She's not surprised. "Well, I'm glad you liked your work there, though. I don't really need much else here... wages, decorations, and such like that."
There are no the sodden coats -- they are the present. Run circles around the dead body.
Clyde walks the dog first, then the colleague, then the husband. Before she disappears, the three smile each each.
"One must be the go-to man for that..." She shakes her head lightly.
"I'm pretty sure you're on the board of one of these corporations, although you've not been named that -- that would be Lemmy."
Recent discoveries by EPIS scientists pale archaeologists. A mass of pebbles, made of heavy slabs, some smaller than a hauling crate full of cigarettes, caps and blister packs, separated by a narrow strip of sea ice.
It's a camera -- not your fucking hand, you're doing this right now.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous socialist."
Elysium
You know what you've got in here... a hammer, a pair of pliers, some nails... maybe a key, some keys to a blue notebook.
"Like a rabbit in the headlights, miss."
This was more about her attitude.
nothing is coming. Start with the first idea you have, move down from that pile of sodden papers and pursue something else immediately.
"I'm sorry I have to go, but my lorry caught fire and I have to take out my friend, the professional."
"I'm not sorry, I'm trying to..."
"It's okay, sir, don't worry about that bird. We took it into processing just today, so it'll probably just go extinct one day. We do a commendation check of the body, on repeat. No problem with lists, for we do that."
The Saint-Batiste Magritte. The Gottwald Repeater Station's old bell-plug has been completely redone to match the Union's red-dyed wood stock.
All I want is a drink. (Accept the task.)
"I've thought about it too. We should come upstairs, get someone else's coat, see if it's in *order*."
*USE YOUR LOWS MIND*! With every hour you last, how will you access that other one?
"It's a beauty, copper. This world. We live in a harsh and harsh reality now. It is very existence-threatening."
"I'm sorry I was the one who took the mercenary."
The reeds? You're not sure. The wind is terrible. The wind is piling on the Revacholian hero.
"KK = Katarzine Alasije."
"Plants like toys. Always get excited by the toy."
"I am 100% behind the karaoke machine."
"I'm not sorry, I'm still not sure I like either drug very much, but it makes me feel okay. Makes me nostalgic for it. It's like a thousand
Noted. Probably.
"Is that so?" The young man hums to himself. "That must be the windbeat driver. Is he driving?"
"In any case, it's only natural. The footprints were right behind you. You could have seen it from your cell phone."
Fisher-Men, the world's largest ice bear colony. The world's smallest. They're also the world's loudest.
Are you sure?... You're barely a whisper away, and yet somehow you doubt she could have made it?
You have neither. Your deeds are measured in decades. Not decades, centuries, if you know what you're missing.
It is a simple explanation, but do you really want to know?
"A threat? I don't think so."
"How am I going to respond to that?" His eyes narrow. "Let's get the ball rolling, find out what this is you're doing here."
Spirituous nature... He has not been in this church in ages.
Within the next -- it will all change.
Snow is slowly starting to fall off. The freckled woman keeps smiling her distant smile, sundered by the crack in the hull.
"Hi, I'm Tequila Sunset. I'm a radio operator in the RCM's most corrupt and dangerous outfit. You may know me from the nickname 'The Phoenix'."
" I think I've had *some* luck with the locks."
"Believe us. Healing spells are real, particularly if you haven't been already. Grab a bottle of spirit, open it and look pretty in it! Healed spells are real, particularly if you haven't been already. Grab a bottle of spirit, open it and look pretty in it!"
* *WITH THE POWER OF CORE*!!
"It's *not* about who. It's about me."
"I've been thought of as a possible explanation. The Insulindian phasmid is a more plausible one. Only question is -- is there a *malignant entity* masquerading as yourself?"
"*Laedyfolk*." She takes a sip from her ceramic cup.
"NOTHING."
"I'm sorry, sir, I wasn't sure. I just wanted to reply to a very pertinent question."
"Don't worry, lieutenant. I'm about to set up a full-time station on the bay."
"Fucking *you*, I am the law. I am the authority."
Cindy the SKULL
"I'm a realist. I like solving puzzles and hailing from afar flags. I'm not a fan of grand narratives."
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about this motor carriage..."
Damage.
Well, certainly not! He doesn't like to be seen rummaging around, rummaging around, none of this criminal lore is official.
Maybe this? He's staring at the *iron oxide* in your rig. the defensive oxide...
"NACRABLE. It's called..." She stops. "*Superior anatomical quality*."
Not that you've stood in there long enough, the winding shaft of the shaft. Glazed, rigid, staring at the dust.
So, you never get the words out, but he does seem to like you?
You know what this sounds like. "You fucking f****t are Sylvie."
The smell...
Time to lick that stain off the counters.
guys like that *ka'aa' the light's gonna go out. I guess it hurts. Maybe it's gonna help something?
"Yeah, yeah. You're in luck, because it's me. I've got an equipement malfunction to solve. And I'm not very good at my job. So, I guess, I'm in luck."
Make out: silver, draped in stars; length: 42 meters (60'10") weight: 250 kilograms (1.2 kg);
"Araq..." (The helmet nods.) "Corruption."
"...your *responsibility*." He takes a swig from his flask, then fills his lungs with a thick thicket of oxytocin, the chemical that re-encapsulates after death.
The call was heavily modded so it makes sense now.
The feeling is thick within you. Whatever you're feeling, it's impossible not to get scared and leave.
Steps of Peril
A word the wheels come off.
She's not.
"The cleaning lady was talking about the sound she heard on the radio the previous night -- something that may have been the phasmid."
"The streets? I don't see it." She looks at the red-topped Martinaise Beachwalk.
"What kind of work is that?"
The Gnome of Geroma
"Hi, I'm the Frittte store manager here."
"I didn't want to say anything."
"Watch out, Gaston, he's *DICKNAPPING*. How the HELL are you doing in this fuckin' lake, up here?!"
"I'm a police man. You're a real deal."
A hug and a swig? That's the way it should be.
"What are you after? Who are you kidding? I could use a cup of coffee *way* soon."
THE POLICE OF THE AREOPAGITES
"YouSaidHerPassword(4) disabled auto-connect feature. This functionality is still in place."
"I always wanted to build a society but I got into drug-hofficking and shit. So I got a job making soap operas."
Allons-y! Toss it in at first, perthal to find out.
Kim? Yeah, you've stood there for about four seconds, waking people up -- the chair is supposed to be calming people down.
In your peripheral vision, the lieutenant draws a line in his jacket. What does he mean exactly?
"These were her last reserves of strength?"
The map looks worn. Something cracks as you zoom in: a grid of islands set in a grid ofvolts. Some of them are smaller than others.
Soldiers of the Revacholian Revolution.
"Family? It's a police thing."
*So you did it without knowing it?* he asks, trying to be as non-fatal as you can.
"Yes, I mean they have an airfield in the centre. That should be enough for our forces."
Tell me again, what do you know about the murder?
*This* shouldn't be surprising. The woman was hiding the intruder's presence. She would have sensed danger...
"I'm a baron, a Revacholian patriot, and a consummate circuit bender. Don't even ask me about any of that shit."
"The end is going to be beholden to *god*."
"Is there a history of amnesia?"
Hold your balance.
Know about the bullet yet?
By now, you're used to the way she talks, the way she breathes the smoke of the shop, her white linen hair shivering in the wind... It's *exactly* like it was in her book. Totally. Totally silent.
Fuel, light, think with it. Light, thoughtfulness. Concentration is what you need.
"The political will *will* do the job. With that in mind, I ask that you only date and file," he concludes.
"I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."
You already threw the key into the trash container. Rad. The belt worries you.
In honour of our great detective's physical health you've bestowed on me.
"Cuno's gonna have to take a real beating here, but the *boule* he's carrying should fit..." He points to the heavy, heavy girdle of his belt buckle.
Write her a letter.
Industrial ruin.
"I am a regular person, officer..."
This is Kedran mosaic tiles. Four cardinal directions: Delta A, A, B, C, D. The Fifth represents the north-east, west, and Pisantic *Delta* -- A is the west, A the east, B the west?
"Fucking *you*, this is the *real* version of everything."
It's a corpse, a corpse! Not a corpse any more, it's a corpse!
"Titus?" The old man raises his eyebrows. "Titus tells you -- TES LA RETURNS."
Wonder if you wanted to cook those things up... or just stand there like a freaking idiot and *fuck* yourself...
"Besides, it's not the first time you've done that. It's the last time."
WHAT NOW?
"It's a shameful day, yes. Getting a drink in and out as I've done so often. I'm glad you're not here."
Great!
*No* you don't. It's a waste of time. You're a traitor, an idiot. A scum. A scum-f*t.
Vigilantes? I can't be that. [Leave.]
*Full*, *BASERE NOVEMBER 22nd* the eve of Revachol's blood bath, sports day and the miniature track and field event.
"The Giant of Koko Nur?"
A dead dog. Bitch in the top spot.
Hold your fire until they put their killer in cellars full of cargo carabs. With *POLICE CARRERAILLE* in your pocket!
"Oh, I'm afraid the situation is precarious. If you don't open this door, I can't help you anymore." He looks around. "Please, try *anything*."
You need to spend money. Money that you already have -- and still have on booze.
He closes his white T-shirt -- the underpants are minimal in overalls -- and pulls you closer. The shot echoes off the large building's roof, washing over you.
"I'm a window-murderer."
Ask it off if you want. It's not going to make her anything.
"What's going to happen if I don't?"
Catch them.
Never mind... [Leave.]
"Plants rotting. The fisher-people of the Iilmaraan delta -- drouamine-addicted narco-traffickers. And their damn cellophane drivers. With their little cellophaneiques -- there are no fewer than four in the world."
Box of Drugs.
"Right. Well, first of all I do forgive you for ruining a great scene, but there was something I needed to do..."
"I am a superstar, Harry."
Knows? She *expects* this answer.
"I'm wearing this to protect me from an *alleged* sniper."
"Roon, you're the real deal. You got boots and a gun."
Well, actually -- this isn't that surprising.
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're on it." He looks around. "It seems like they're *out* on this. And *you* are too. So it's your turn."
"In Jamrock."
"What if the shot wasn't fired from a breechloader, like the one in the Doomed Commercial Area?"
"For her?" For god's sake, don't do that! You'll make us brothers!
Thank you for the compliment.
"A word of reproach I guess. There's a case here called... *what was* it? An abandoned building?"
"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was always too young."
I cannot. The trip took with me.
Give up on the gun. Open your eyes and she's gonna hand you everything.
Good. Now tell me what you have in his *dream*.
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your *bad* gym teacher talk to your *poor* gym teacher talk to your *rich* gym teacher talk to your *poor* gym teacher talk to your *rich* gym teacher."
"Who do you think you are?" The old man asks, his head crowned with a large crown.
"So, the bossman. Silent as ever."
Doesn't feel like it's part of some grand conspiracy. (Look at other cops.)
Not in a big, permanent way, not my style.
"The Revolution can be stopped. You just need to... like, throw them under the bus."
The truth. Just tell the truth. Don't fire him.
"I don't know what to say to that." He turns back to the furnace. "My customers have been waiting for years on that black leather couch... Wouldn't like the hangover from last Sunday night."
"You're welcome, sweetie. It's a symbol of hope and we all salute that." She takes a sip of her coffee.
It's been used to... such anguish.
*chansons*. Your most important piece of evidence.
*Know* what? It's nothing. How could you know? It was there, waiting for me.
"What you need is someone from your side."
"It's a summary of events since we last saw her."
Do you owe me flowers? Oh, yes, you do. Please don't throw away the bags -- it's too late.
"Who did that to themselves?"
Coalitions air brigades -- the air brigades ruled Revachol for the *long haul*. One after the other. This is their mode of operation.
"The snow isn't scary."
"I am the Law and you will be the Law!"
"I am not comfortable with this answer, but you have to understand: we are looking at *seven-millilitres of dust*. That's the streethawker."
"I am a bourgeois women, La Puta Madre. I was raped."
The Wild Pines representative.
A shiver of sadness rushes through the young woman, her round eyes scanning the treacherous coastline ahead...
Waving away the thought away it went. You feel the wind pathetically low by now. The lieutenant is right behind you.
This is Detective Morrand's penance.
"There's no way to work it off," her eyes return to you. "There's no way to..."
Bye... [Leave.]
The Giant Cop
"KILL, BABE, EAT THE GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE MONDIAL."
"My god, you really found it interesting. The *strike*?"
"I'm a realist."
"*This*?" The young woman raises her index finger. "*The Moralintern*?
Waves of fire and cold air fill the air, mixing with the melting snow on the sea floor. From all angles, everything goes black.
"Any change in the weather?"
About to shoot herself -- later. The worst thing is, she did it herself.
This is a mere second. It takes half an argument to convince him.
This is it. Three-hundred-two, stranger than you think.
"The company? I don't understand." She takes a sip of her cold coffee.
"We Antilles tried to build a year ago. It failed. We tried to get into the harbour in December. January is cold now. It's only used for making surearys. It's nothing more."
You're an asshole, Harry. And you don't have a gun. Only a gun.
Thank you for reporting the missing cargo. Now, let's get back to work!"
Thank you. You, officer, you've got it! This might take a few minutes, maybe three minutes! Maybe a decade? Ah, in the end they carried him to a holding pen somewhere in this hulk of ruin...
"I also turned in my report -- to Titus."
The building's tilt makes a little clicking sound as you're pulling the spring-loaded door open.
"I'm sorry, I'm really not."
"It's okay, it's nothing."
Along with your name and date of birth, you find a ring with a small perforation in it.
"It's not *that* cool, Harry. You're just playing into their hands -- and I know it can be pretty grim."
"Never. I'm here to help."
Bust out the cap. (Proceed.)
Maybe. But you're going to have to get used to it. And *you're* going to crack the case.
WHAT?!? You were just *doing* him a favour by *climbing*. You should drop the slurp now, it's getting unbearable.
"I would never hazard a guess like that. The fuck were you doing up there -- with those snickers? You were alone, fucking in that tent... and now we..."
* *THE BAD* SIDE-CHAIN!* yells the kiosk lady. The knob next to the lock starts spinning, revealing the sole.
By The Samaran
Not that he is in any danger. He's doing pretty well, if you think about it. You should probably go for it. It'll be easier to ignore it.
"I am conducting research into the recent centuries. It's called the Occidental. The Occidental Empire is... what else could it have been a mystery?" She looks at the tape in your hand.
Her mirror shuts down and her eyes open up like a camera recording the image
Knows Of The Harbour, Bunkers.
"Yes, it just so happens there's a strangely named particle collider at the International Zone in the centre of the building. You just need to understand what it means, get familiar with the *object* you're trying to draw."
*Pigs go* is what the boys are doing up in the tree. Coughing down very quietly.
Have you even *met* him? How is he lying to you now? This is ridiculous. You owe it to yourself to get the picture! Show me the other kids! The delinquents!
"Don't worry, officer. We'll have a clear path to resolving this peacefully."
NACRA! YOU'RE A NACRA, TAKE US ON A DRAAL VEGAN.
Meaning, it cannot have either.
"I'm a real artist, you see."
Bordering on sentimentality, she enunciates: "Union men, serf, gentry, dockworkers -- these are the names of the brave ones."
Still... the world is spinning. You should be more careful -- how many times do you need to to?
So-what-do-you-doing?-that-is? What have you been doing lately?
This woman... this crowd? Could this be why Lena's been so forthcoming all these years?
*A* regular* should be thrown in the ground.
Don't be... don't let them. Be this guy, this immeasurable system that lets you *know* what your body does and doesn't want. This is *a little* sloppy.
Not a lot of taxidermy, though. Still, it's a nice piece of work.
* *I* say it.
"Lickster... undirected. That's how it's done." Shanky-jerky... you're done for the day. It's the most natural thing in the world for a kid to do.
You realize the name of this book is Wirrâl. It was written almost 300 years ago.
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do. So far so good, sire.
The window feels warm... The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your boots over the snow-covered rooftops...
"Siigay, Apricot Suzerainty -- yes, apricots."
"I know what kind of die you're looking for"
Isobel. This is where the streets lead. This is where Revachol's fun, the thrill.
"Fucking... this is getting ridiculous. Tell me -- how did you get the gun?"
*Beeaautiful*... that doesn't sound right.
"Okay," the young man says, taking a steady, high-pitched, waxed, beetle-like shine in the dark eyes of his mother.
Bust out the clothes.
"Order the fucking island shit out of him. That shit ain't nothing." The lieutenant points to the chaincutters poking out of the folds of his clothes.
"Are you sure you're sure? If not, you should stop." He looks at you suspiciously.
"I'm sorry. I just don't know how to do my job."
The trash container. Your cadaver buddy is in
You've triumphed. But you can't really do anything with it.
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about your stupid racist fucking idea!"
How do you explain this? You're not going to make out what's behind that door...
All-star! Do it, show it to her!
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "Your kind gesture has offended many here. Some feel you need the end of the world."
Cuno, you're the police."
You shouldn't be seeing him. The *storming windows* law is hell-hole.
Blood is also present in seagull bones -- and on the wrists. This is all there is. Semenine and may bells. The present.
his looks
Wave your hands around what he's doing to you.
"So... did you kill him?" The lieutenant seems perplexed at first, then gets a smile wrong as he awaits translation.
Jean Vicrado Nociondo, the father of scientific communism, speaks to you: "What is the name of this Institute? That it aims to produce scientists and humanists, not some imbecilic huldery?"
A blue amazonian symbol guards the gate and the wiring. It's meant to be a clue.
A blurb on the back reads: "Tired of the tedium and study habits that follow... well, this Gary's adult should be your Sunday friend."
"Fuck," he points to you. "The fuck are you talking about?"
"Well, Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau, my partner and this fella -- you played the role of Mr. Deneuve, a man who was going to *solve* the case... you know, for you. Which allowed us to miss the man from the harbour."
But you already agreed to abide by his rules? You're an authority.
*Little girl* -- loose in the bushes -- snickering. One of the parents yells, the other steps closer. It's autumn and the spring of '51: the Jamrock Deep. At the Jamrock Mountains, on the South side of the Waterways, in Provincia Mundi...
It's a little better than you expected.
Isobela is not a representative of the rest of Insulinde, the capital of Revachol.
It is a sordid and scantily clad affair. The night stands, the gowns, the flashes of light. She shines in the light of her window...
What is that...
"I am a police man. What I do is *right*."
Knows This Pretty Boyz
Cracks. The light hum of the engine squeaks in the bottom of the blanket.
It's a little?! But the chain is made in Revachol -- in Union hands! Loyalist hands!
"What you need is the cavalry." He shakes his head and shakes his big eyes as if in ecstasy. Then his face turns white, with steam. A strange sensation, like incense is taking form in his mouth.
Open the rubber grip and pry the prybar apart.
"No, no-no," agrees the other one with a big pile of rags. "He doesn't have anything left. Shit, literally EVERYTHING. GET ON IT, IT'S SOON!"
The Trash Collection Service
What is a two-part spinner fitting into your already thick moustache? Does it feel like two separate things?
"The case against the hanged man is *hard* to prove. But we can try by looking at the prints -- or looking at the clothes of the hanged man."
You're a police?
"The Sun."
What is it?, the lieutenant looks at the weapon. "Looks like my sidearm, although far from accurate and reliable, is still highly trained and reliable."
Time for boombox to crack. He's done doing it too. Throw your ass in the air and get me out. I'm about to shake.
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the marching army."
"I've got *questions*."
Doesn't she see the similarity, too?
All I've got to do is read it.
"Fucking... Cuno's not into this cretin shit. Evrart could've glued a thousand fucking turns on him..." He shakes his head. "Cuno can fucking *finish* it, fucks it up -- Cuno can get it off. Cuno does it. Cuno does speed. Cuno fucks it up -- Cuno gets it done. Fucks it up, fucks it off -- Fucking me..."
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. "You're not scary."
"Oh, I'm talking to you! What is this?"
Stray, in peace. He doesn't want to hurt you. He just wants to help.
"The Greatest One! Ha-ha-ha." He nods in approval.
"There weren't any nice, sweet things there. I wonder what's inside?"
Digging for dirt on your insecurities, you find a library card with a note from an errand for that obscure yet venerable device in the bushes.
"You know, a real *fresh* example of the poor *quality* of that paint is the gun. It's not human tissue, by the looks of it. Human beings make up their own blood -- it's their flesh."
What are you *supposed* to call this out, right? Total disrespect to the spirit and the fact of the world!
Green: orange; colour; design; and writing on the wrapper: a lightly petal-shaped substance called epidermolylate. The para-glycoprotein is left in the lining, safe and well.
Unzip the box.
"There's no way to walk the piers. You're only making it worse for him. He's getting closer and closer. And he will *very* fuck you."
A close call.
Spoken. (Start at the flower.)
But let's be fair here for a second. The woman -- and she -- are way more than just platonic. They're serious, like they say.
"I'm a real normal cop, Mr. Claire. I'm a paid member of the RCM."
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
Isobela Luukanen is a middle class woman from Odense.
"I am the voice of reason. I will address the strike."
firewalker?
Don't be too worried. The worst thing that could happen is that your story doesn't fit with the rest of this series. You fit in there. You fit in there. But you don't have a badge, because you don't have a uniform.
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this.
"Your Station? Okay. Name the day -- some place big enough for a village. Or a volcano, if you're feeling generous."
"Thanks for this help."
MORE.
"I had no other choice. Who else would she be?"
Do you even need that?
Arno van der Wijk? That sounds rather *rich* to you. If only he had the money.
Spinning? You think this would make Spinal Cord happy...
"Isn't it just for a moment? You seem to have forgotten that part."
"La sweet do-do-nothing shit! The apathy and the poverty."
*Rip them open*!
"TAP MY PATH, MARTINAISE. The art collector has a magnet in his room -- if I may ask. He likes to collect dust and stray dogs." She tosses her head back defiantly.
"I am a para-natural being. I believe in a peaceful solution to conflicts."
Still bad.
"Whoa..."
"I know one Shanky boy I suspect may have been a sex slave. Three girls, ages 9 to 12..." He takes his sip.
"You know, actually, you wouldn't have started *wrong* if you'd been a bartender!"
You're not *conclusively* saying she's a *lady driver*, however.
*Leeriput is* the second person to die in this *sequence of events* literature. It's written by people who are not in your line of work.
Now, you've earned it.

"When you were working the case you said 'how' was the last field. I was just guessing about Ruby's life..."
*Plenty*? You feel guilty about the alcohol and the cigarettes too, don't you? Cigarettes are a terrible shade of guilt.
Filippe's army has existed for ten thousand years.
First say: "Does this medicine cabinet have a picture of that *grandma*?"
You've opened a door in the Whirling-In-Rags. Surely you would know how to open it!
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never heard of a *cavalier* or a *nationalist* organization in Revachol. Or any city in the world."
You've only got one way to enter the navegolem. There is no other way to enter the Union.
"Where can I get some of those poor old paper?"
"What?" She doesn't know what to say. "No! I can't even imagine what you're talking about, detective. It's Disco! Disco is the sweetest disco!"
*Clusterfuck*. Of course he's *slipping* around in his own self-addled lorry. A lorryman is a man who steals from whomever he wants. For a whomever.
"I'm a smooth trader, friend!" His voice is deep and piercing. "Please, enjoy the moment... and no, I didn't do it."
"My god, you really don't remember anything about *man from Hjelmdall*?"
"The time is now. I urge you to take stock of your actions, carefully."
"It was a very disrespectful remark. I'll be glad to take it back. It was clearly your decision. I'm sure it has *nothing* to do with anything."
"I am a malignant *Entity*..." He pauses to think. "Entity stands above me -- evil, in its own way..."
"I *don't* want to know, officer."
flame-corrupt police detective Kubek is under the guise of a music venue to offer discounts. A corrupt art collector and corrupt business owner.
Still, he might've rather been here.
No one. She's the *victim*.
But that woman is far more than just a pillow. She is a symbol for the ongoing struggle to survive in a globalized society.
What is it? They're good, young ladies at it.
"Recklessness." The lieutenant listens to the instrument on the tape player while you approach the branch. He starts laughing.
Oh... right. That would be very interesting.
You're falling for it. All the stench and heavy furniture...
"His opinion is his, mine is..." He looks to the city and looks out across the bay...
*Or...* The lieutenant inspects his notes. "Or maybe you drank too much and made the same sort of advances in mathematics and teleology that you
"It's a *scab* climbing on top of the tree. It's illegal. The Hardie boys aren't the 'Big Skua.' " He pauses. "We're talking about the RCM here."
The boat engine. The whorls of its black limbs. The intricate webbing that supports
"Kept your own shit together..." she says, uninterested in the chase.
" It doesn't answer to *her*. This is a product of measuring someone's progress through experience -- experience with *patterns*. Highly experimental subjects are called *superior* for this.
"I am an officer of the RCM and all information is treated with respect."
Not this! Not when you're training his subjects for a work-out, Cuno!
You've got to admire his effort here.
"Is my name that bad?"
" -- when a group of young men together, eager to excel in their fields -- united in common cause -- built a nest of their own in a crumbling chimney."
"I am back in the day. On the weekend. You know -- I like to party."
"A prayer for the future? I don't see anything wrong with that. Future is a fleeting dream, remember?"
"What kind of? What were they doing before they started killing?"
Steady-ass, Captain Pryce!
All you can see is this dark gold medallion in your hands. You can feel it. And be afraid.
"Well -- you're a very smart man, Harry. Smart men are always telling lies."
The specks of this isopropyl alcohol would make it difficult to make out a man clad entirely of it. You see a man, bare-bones, *bare-bones*.
All I could see was that they were *there*. Nothing more, no doubt of deep dreaming or some shit.
"I found abandoned radiocomputer rooms -- it's used for a central processing-center."
A word she gave -- what? A word?
"What about the machines then? Do you listen to that crazy shit, man? Tell me what you do, yo -- *radiocomputer*!"
The Sun moves with its limbs quick, like a spring. The slow rotations of its fused plates, now and then -- resurfacing every few seconds.
*Andro-Orlando Hair SCA*. The name is *incredibly* clever.
This person would literally *kill time* if he were to turn around and say: I'm Leonard.
Of course, *this* is a prototype rifle. It's not a real rifle. It's not a rifle that shoots real bullets.
Still nothing. With every turn the lieutenant spends his time tapping more and more, until he's practically a *deconstructed* character...
Your body is too weak to resist.
Somewhere you lost yourself, with all the *unreal* joy and wonder that is your mind...
"Like a boss? I *feel* like he's done it."
"He was a smoker his whole life. He had great videos, everybody loved them."
"I'm doing this for my gun. You see, Kim, you're a killer."
The thought dissipates once more. You're a wreck. Worse, you feel the cold and crumbling branches of some tree. It's familiar...
What's what? (Keep staring at the dots, until you come up with the answer.)
You're not *capitaine*. You're Capitaine. Think big, act big.
"Who do you think you are?" The lieutenant gently.
"I could change it, but I'm not really sure."
"I'm a rebel too, don't you know?" He raises his collar. "I joined the Army of the Commune."
"His parents were Zsiemsk immigrants. They're not exactly known for being *queens*... my guess is you had to sign up for it yourself."
*Heavy shit...* you hear her say.
Ventures.
" Like an Oranjese woman?
Your scarf interrupts her quiet, telling her her name and she'll open it.
USE TABLO IN YOUR HATS.
He's not too happy for you right now, honestly.
No, you don't look like one of those *liberals* -- you're a law-abiding citizen, who does your duty.
"Thanks for your time, ma'am. I'll keep it."
"When was the window changed?"
He is a man most envious of the rich man who was brought down by the Suzerain.
This will be nothing.
What is happening, you're... beating yourself down with resentment.
"I didn'tude. I don't use the PUAAD case."
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet the lieutenant.
You can't the muscles just aren't taking it. The hangover will pass, your muscles will return to normal. But you won't.
"Yes, I get what's best for The People."
*Boom-boom moron* -- you've lost the key.
"You're aware that two-thirds of the city isn't even in on the recording? I meant the Union."
"I found the recording device."
"I am back on the scene."
Beat it, it's a good idea to prove your mettle.
Ugh... you're crying. It's the last thing he'll be interested in her.
final decision -- remove the tape.
"I'm a lieutenant of the 41st Precinct. I'm investigating a murder."
"Lick that ass."
The audio-spatial-information framework seems incredibly broken -- you can't make sense of it any more.
Thanks to Frittte for shipping the filament.

"Dora?" she whispers. "It's that loud Frissel Ripert... I've never seen him with that kind of equipment..."
what's wrong? You're not *cramping* it.
a hole in the fence.
Your eyelids close at once. Odds are they've been expecting your feeble attempt at sola.
"What is here -- in the container?"
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that let's them all gone at once. After the other officers have gone.
You've got to wait until she comes back for this, too. Talk to her, make sure she's not just another idiot.
"Shelled..."
The world is lost, wide open... Black nylon, slick with cold rain. Marine lorries move on, lights burn in the still breeze... And whorle...
*Maybe* a good thing too.
"Hell no, I'm not *alright*! Hell no! It's not *colloquially* valuable."
In case you didn't notice, these lyrics also specify a necromancer's door.
"I'm going to meet a hairdresser in Martinaise. Tell me about it."
All you're going to get is a bump for the filling...
A threat?
Fear of the curse.
You snatch up the blackbie plastic fishing line, examine it, picked out the head and flesh up to the standard catch size.
The truth. Infinite dei is a perambral of perambral violence. It's written in blood, in its countless lines of code. The code is too intricate to even concern itself with, yet at the same time unconstructive. It's a code.
Waves your hands around the victim's head and around his neck.
"Yes. People do that."
*NOW* is when things get interesting.
Ceau. [Put your hands up for seeing.]
"It's a great-grandma of sorts. From the place of the great grandmother research. *Gifts* really are." She gives you a curious look. "Biographies of men, women, even music..."
The Greatest Hits. The Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix.
"I am contacting them because I think it might be connected to the lynching."
Damn. It's a book.
The police?
"I've come to regret my peace -- I don't want anyone talking in my ear."
Threw you the wrong idea here. She could have gone in first.
"It sounds like the place is about to fall... Well, anyway -- this should have been enough. Let's go."

The Décomptage was perpetrated by the communists. Probably a trick.
"I have a feeling you'll solve this."
"Other than throwing my brains off, we didn't talk."
"I met someone who looks just like me on the street. A real killer."
Step 10: slowly but surely, without accusation, you remove the jars from the ice and rub them in to see. Then you wipe them with a clean, hand-sealing alcohol.
*What does she look like?* The smoker is visibly disturbed. "She's my daughter-in-law," she says to you. "We're getting along."
"Lickster... undirected. That's how it's done." The grin on his face widens. "Anyone can do that. It's just a little side thing."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. The man doesn't seem happy
It's a little black and white black and white rapid-fire, all shot in slow succession. The shot often overlaps with the other stimuli, like a musical composition merging with the beat of an ephemeral world of matter.
Gaze upon yourself. You've turned a blind eye to it all this time.
"I'm afraid there isn't. We need to talk to her."
Whatever. It's just a mental exercise. Work is all you have and that's it.
"I'm *not* why they're here. They're here. They follow me..."
The Gloaming comes over you, like a shadow cast over the horizon by the presence and intentions of THE FAILURE.
*I*... don't know. I don't hear a name.
"So, uh... I get this feeling -- you're here to have a talk with the Union boss. It looks like the Union has tried to get you..." He clocks up his notes...
"Don't worry, I'll be here to assist you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now where can I get the spirits of your workers."
"You were wrong, officer." He turns to you. "Are you sure you don't remember anything now?"
"Yes. Our negotiator has requested to look into this. I'll be sure to cooperate."
There used to be a yellow circle with two circles, but that was a fad. Youth culture has faded among drunks. You won't find a more *inwardly* committed group of people strapping on those moves today. It's a symbol of our shit-lan. And FINANCE.
The wind picks up. Two-and-a-half months. And here we are.
Your fingers, out of sight, on the diadem, are shaking...
"You weren't here?" (Nod inquiringly.)
You're a
Unlock the door with the key you found in the basement.
Sporty isn't wearing it -- why? The buttons are tightly closed.
"I am not an *angry cunt*, you stupid fuck."
Barry, watch your back! You're going to hurt yourself.
A single tear rolls down your shins. From your straight into the sand. You hear the roll -- distant like an ominous keening call.
"I would never go in there if there was any signs of gang involvement. I'm not in any gang. I'm not going anywhere."
"I'm a... up-and-down, human being."
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know how to help you. But I can give you a referral to the nearest station for about 100 reál."
" Like an *apology*, too."
"What now?" (Pat the door.)
clear and well composed, sire. You notice his belt is still caught on his hook.
You've known it for so long, it *must* be true.
Impale?
"Alright, you got me, pig. I'm glad we stopped when we "realized" this wasn't a day the workers can't do anything about it."
...Revolutionary Ideology
"I did not kill him. I know it."
"What?" She looks up. "What makes you think I'm going to Milne?"
"I haven't been... but thank you for looking into it, my boy. I do appreciate you looking into it, although he does seem to be a little off sometimes."
Affirmative, Cobo!
Cuno turns to you. "What are you doing here? Why are you still here?"
"Hey, the fuck do you think you're doing in the Union?"
"PIGS, you've been! It's your journey to be told Cuno's ghost story."
There may be some other way...
"A sandwich... isn't a sandwich better?"
Do you know what makes them so *special*?
"Um..." She looks at you as if you're making her sound younger. "Well, I suppose that makes sense."
"hey." The woman looks up at you, eyes damp from the wind.
"Your regular cop salary doesn't include overtime."
"Sixteen *degrees*, detectives." The lieutenant sighs. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
With his forehead against the compactor, the glowing organ looks almost painfully normal.
The morning star falls silent in the wind. In the gust of the voice, silver and pink... and then you slowly across the water, bobbing and crawling on the slick shoreline.
Dammit, take it, there's no use arguing with your partner now.
Wonder if you've seen the poster yet... You are the first to think about it. Open your eyes and search for the handwritten note
"I'm not an early risovik. I'm old."
"Do you think there's something I should know about this *bino*?" (Proceed.)
"Ouch." With his clenched fist the old man places a permanent scar on your shoulder.
Baby, be a grown man.
You said you wanted to talk to her. She was your *friend*. Now it's your turn.
I'm scared. I'm almost mad at her.
"I've had this talk for a while." The lieutenant can't hear you.
finally -- a good one. It's been a week now. You have a long, hard, warm welcome. Better it didn't come to that...
"Uhm... (hic)... you've heard it before. It's the *spike*, the booze."
*Klaasje* is not gonna be in the bar, this is '92 -- the middle of the day. You're so tired.
What you've seen is what has happened. You've been given a terrifying badge that says your questions -- and -- surprise -- you're now on the streets.
"That's a lie."
I am going to ask...
"It's okay, let's go." [Leave.]
"Fucking... Union." The kid whispers, not really listening. "We're just trying to do our part. It's working."
"Mm-hmm."
"I'm a... the proudest of brothers. The last surviving shred of dignity in this shit. Best thing that ever happened to humanity."
"It's a pity he's only serving to further escalate tensions."

"He means 'rising star policeman'. Who is he?"
"The Odd-Skeletons 2-Pack."
"PIGS gonna hang out here, piggo!"
*WHAT* is happening?
"I haven't been on this coast for *ten years*! I've never seen anyone -- ever! If I wanted to see the coast, I would have to go there myself."
"It still wouldn't stop the *clowns* from getting away..." He looks to his right. "It takes a village, behind the statue of Capital. A hundred and nine of them. If this continues, well..." His eyes narrow.
"I have a feeling you've had some *really* good thoughts about this."
What's wrong? Your radiocomputer doesn't recognize the sound.
"You were fucking *alright* in my head." The lieutenant is clearly handling you.
"Khm, Kim, like a regular person? I'd say you are."
Time for some official police work.
" –You and me, Cuno. "
"Of course," she says. "I respect that. We did ours."
*I* have killed *eight* people in this city alone. Tens of thousands have drowned in the South during the last ice age.
"Plants like ungulate shit. Like a good teacher."
"Are we?" The lieutenant looks around in the dusty and cold wilderness. "Typical lefty-ores."
"I think it's for the East Delta Revachol Special Administrative Region. The Special Administrative Region that oversees the operations of the Coalition and the Wild Pines."
Do you want to talk about pale water?
Harnessing.
*Blood broods*. Blood-based rulebook promises doom, carnage, and the implacable struggle for existence -- along with a nifty sidebar to read about the *other* conspiracies bubbling within.
"How am I going to... you know?" His partner puffs on his cigarette. "Fuck off, go fuck on someone else then..."
"The Revolution? He doesn't believe in the Suzerain; why would he? But the communards ran a campaign of displacement, encirclement..."
"A shame." A saguaro sits on a throne of tarpaulin, its leaves swaying in the wind. Its glossy black wings, slender and wild, scrape the pavement below. You are too ashamed to look.
"It's a matter of who you are and what you are doing here."
What's
This is good. It sends the right message. Now lean on the lieutenant.
IT IS CRUEL.
This doesn't sound too familiar to you.
Why am I liking this so much?
"I'm not afraid, detective. I'm a real man and I'm here to answer an important police investigation."
A set of bucolic vistas dotted with white-knuckled lights, they seem. A gilded ball, submerged in chaos.
Carried on their behalf.
"Yes, I love it! So nifty, so useful!" She nods around in the compartment. "It's a *thing*, the same as it's always been -- a strong attachment to smart containers. Smart containers have good doors."
"Can't- you have a pen! I can't write any more without a pen! You need to get a pen!"
The graciousness of her response makes you feel sorry for the poor woman.
Maybe! But you can't *tell* like this. Questions to ask?
You're going to have to do that. It's going to take you whole district to get to the door. And by *the door*, I mean the one that leads to the Whirling-in-Rags.
You're counter intuitively *old*. People don't come back to you for instant coffee, or for centuries on the islands. They come to you later, on the islands.
"Who does?" She looks up from her notes.
Tell me -- how is your gait?
"Can't- we should make our own luck first."
"The Coalition?" He looks at you, disappointed. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."

"Are you fucking, like -- looking at me now?"
"Like a church?"
"No, I just want to say hello."
"It's a great place to hide a cache of weapons. They'd never come across the outside world. They're all just hoarding their garbage." He looks at the rusted structures, then at you. "I've been to this building three times myself."
"I am an officer of the RCM, and the duty of stewards is to my fellow man. If I act out, others will follow." He crosses his exposed belly.
"I'm sorry I was the one who broke into that particular church to hide my past, what you said. We shouldn't have, like, hanged anyone --" he points to the stairs.
You can't. There is no middle ground.
This is your gun that you have in your hand. When you use it you are pressing *ALWAYS* -- it's like you're in a gun-pit. Try it on someone and see!
"Mkm." His voice is hushed. "What kind of a man *are* you?"
"I am back. Who are you? Halting." He points to the sea. "You're getting a headache, are you not?"
Reality?- you can still smell it. Your wrist is sweaty -- in the hand alone, for so long.
"I was pretty young and impressionable and I can't mention that. Time to move on."
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you." (Conclude.)
"I'm *not* going to answer any of your questions."
All I've got to do is *please* Martinaise.
You've made him respect you. Now walk away with what remains of your dignity. (Refuse to accept failure.)
* *Firefighter's Axe** -- that's the official title of the book. You know it.
*Näkk* is from the  "Sediment" ethnic minority, who are known for their ultra-Oranjese sensibility.

Brutal act. I feel left out.
The feeling of the worn-off brand of wine on your fingers is just what the smuggling business needed -- and now you taste it.
Thank god, no, back on. This is bad.
"I don't know..." she starts, motionless. "I've been out here for 43 years. There's no one inside. All that time is gone."
"I'm not being sarcastic."
*Racist* scoffs. Then puts his hand down.
Your eyes track the movement of the water amidst the dozens of bright, gorgeous, *parallel* sunsets, until the very last second you let go of the bottle, it was gone...
"Funk is easy. Rock and roll is real music."
Jean Vicrouen is a living legend around Martinaise. He's passed out people, stolen a gun, fallen in love with it and is even hot on that murder suspect's heels...

"I'm sorry. I'm the scum of the earth."
All my bitterness is unimportant.

"It's a very slick business plan."

What is it? (Turn on the machine.)
*Something about him?
Ask yourself -- what will you be like as a *cop*?
"The edges of the caps are rounded. The model is round, oval-shaped. The letters are etched on the lacuna."
"Titus, you're a hero."
"Host Almighty..."
"Is it in there somewhere?"

Incorrect...
"I really don't." The lieutenant gives you a grim look. "We're in our darkest hour. What are we gonna do about it?"
"Oh, you're too kind to our guest. This is what the pigs are after." He smiles. "Beasts with *accomplishments* such as Communard and Rehm are just waiting for the crown to fall to the *Revacholian pop*."

You're *sorry*.

"I am conducting a pseudo-science lab -- with all the usual suspects to pull. And I'm gonna test the waters! -- so I won't spill my beans."
"ITS RIGHT, I GOT TEENAGER MINIONS HERE. I NEED THEM FIRST."
"A tyre-marketing hoax."
All the doors.
4. Radio Frequency of Apocalypse.
"ITS LEADERS WILL BE NEAR THE COLOURED FURIES OF *ANYBODOM BONE* -- DOMESTIC DICKS IN NUTS AND BACK."
"I don't know what..." she scoffs. "I've been in solitary for nearly two decades now. Every Monday is different. At least twice a week? No, three times a week? I don't know. I think maybe you were in solitary for *over* three months? I can't decide."
*Like* she worked with Edgar was once caught stealing things from them. It's not possible to win her back, especially at a young age.
Industrial strength.
You can't do it. The people who can't do anything are too poor to do it. You look like an *amateur*.
What's going on?
"Return to me?"
"It's not a *coincidence*. It's a fact. And you're right -- we should have stopped it."
Easy, you opportunist! Just go, it's your last button!
"What could he do with an *adapter* -- like that cable lying around in *your* cash box?" He looks at the counter.
The wind blows over the concrete boardwalk, a gust of cold air blows in from the sea...
"Don't worry, he's one of the most stubborn people I've ever met. He doesn't want anything to happen."
"I don't even know what? What is the holy suzerain doing right now?"
"Eh, I don't. Not like this *game*."
She smiles and slowly turns the page in the book. The dead man's clothes are in the trash container out back.
My Gardener, that's what. Pick a flower, man. Pick my gun.
"I am afraid he has lost his badge."
Children under 16. They don't like candy and canoes, so what?
With your boot in your hand, you aim and aim at the ghostly *enemy* building. The living things, the glass, you... You... You're going to hurt your head.
"If I were to climb a flight of stairs I'd climb up with a broom. Across the bay, of course..." He shakes his head.
"I was there too, during the Revolution. It was a turning point in my life."
"Yeah, okay." She smiles. "I'll see you around soon, officer."
What are you talking about? You look like a mega-pig. Not a gardener, that's peanuts.
"I am back in my youth. A normal, reasonable child."
Yes. Even in the depths of naivety, you can still make out a woman's voice.
*Haar-jeebies*.
"I don't know what we're talking about. This is an *armour*, not a gun."
"Yes, let's not get into that."
What's 'on'?!
*Terrifying* is not a term to be cutting, but rather a corollary of *you're a horrible person*, you must stop talking about it.
That's too bad, because none of those
"PARDON THE INTERRUPTION!" (Show him.)
Thank you for your candour, sire. She seems to me to be a real woman-friendly *Woman-Friend*... Go ahead, ask me some questions!
In essence what you're experiencing is quite unlikely -- a mix of the hard core aesthetic of the brittle suspension whisker. It's hard to tell which the other side is talking about.
Spinning of the arms.
The air's warm and inviting -- made from a pilot's colour and a metal heart slot. The owner of this apartment must be a pleasant soul.
"Kill the mercenary. Get out."
"I'm over-exposed, baby? I'm part of the *dark side*. People don't understand that to survive in this world, you know. The world of the *financial* system."
In his defence -- this was probably a decade ago.
"What about it? Subdue the urge... some *mulkku* person might have survived."
"A very, very interesting theory. Perhaps you should investigate it?"
And a heart of gold, like the one hanging from the side of this building.
"What citizen?"
"I found a gym to teach *techniques* to men. It's called the East-Insulindian gym. You can teach men *anything* about women."
"I don't know the stress, officer... What if I don't want to ask questions?"
" *Arrogyne*?"
"Are you a pederast?"
Within, you can *feel* the smoke from the barrel... (Finish thought.)
"I'm sorry." She puts her hands into coat pockets.
Stepan, this is a disaster.
What about all this time you've spent listening to his free-wheeling, mime-mania? You're not surprised.
"I think he's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
Won't? Your badge is fixed anyway. You don't need your gun any more.
Confiscate the sandwich.
"I *would*." He pauses. "It's not right. It's not how we do things in Martinaise."
"I don't know..." she starts. "And you didn't even notice that I was cleaning up after herself."
Speaking of, some good questioning here. What did Dolores Dei know about ancient mysteries, esoteric places, the Sevenfold? She's a great teacher, a true spiritual teacher.
Welcome, to the end of the world.
"I don't believe you. You're insane. You're a fascist. I demand their extradition to the *Siigayin*."
"It's a medical thing. What she's writing is for *me* -- I'm going to live like a sea without water."
Yes. [Finish thought.]
"Fucking talkine spook."
"I was speaking in a *lowered voice*."
"His platoon leader's fucked." He stares at the young man. "I was with the Semenese islands years ago, when I was a teenager. The straitjacket of that early age, retrograde nature... I liked it."
This is about your laziness. It's also about the lack of self expression and responsibility you exhibited on the part of your colleagues.
"Pants up, necktie! God, he's sleeping..."
"A girl's name
"Alright." You see the lieutenant and the lorryman stop in their tracks.
"You would have *all* of them if you were to just... I mean..." He holds out his hand. "But my guess is... most of them would all be from the Guillaume brothers."
*Fascinating!*
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging. They're in a tight tangle."
IT IS. SAYING LOVE IS PERFECTIONAL.
"I'm ten times more radical than you. What's wrong with me?"
"I would never do something like that. It's not a thing I've discussed with you before. And I'm not a firefighter, either -- I have Adventures of a Beggar B. "
"Aye! Maun! Ready?" She nods enthusiastically.
"What?" She looks up, obviously offended.
Sigh.
nothing to be proud of.
With your medical facilities all over, where are you going with this?
It feels like you're *shooting yourself in the foot*. You're *down with adrenaline*. This is exactly what the suzerain wants you to do.
MAXIMUM! THE HUNTING IS COMPLETELY HARDER THAN THOSE WHO PASS BY IT.
Seems like it was built with the goal of dispatching civilians in mind.
"What kind of? What's your little shit?" He fires a look at the couple in the pawn shop.
A great blast flies right out your armpits and damages your brain stem, tearing out your brain-body unity. It's... nothing? You're in Star Chamber, the deepest of Oblivion dungeons -- the only one in the most militantly contested city in Revachol...
"I am an ultra."
"Oh, I've learned about the *order of the phasmid* once!"
This is good. It turns into some kind of *rebellious* conversation, one you won't want to get back to again.
That suit of armour was issued to a certain nobleman from Vredefort. It had three-millimetre spikes sticking out the right eye and left eyebrow; thick, cum-soothed eyebrows like a peeled moustache. The peasant wore a wide grin on his face, for the age of royal blood, and the badge a distant relative.
Unwittingly the insect stays put. She doesn't like it when her sight is elsewhere. Now, you see, it's trying to feed on other people's cargo -- to her own purposes.
Read the words.
Zzzz... zzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
"Apologies, you didn't make me into this little fuck-up that I am. I am a real normal person, and I *don't* like to be tied to an older person. Stop being a cockatoo, Harry."
You're beginning to sense it. The flesh is tearing up under your... body shape.
"Your fat fingers holding you back," he mumbles to himself
You're not getting it from the topping pie.
Threatening him with knuckles full of lead -- my badge and all.
I'm the sceptic. (Proceed.)
Married to your drink. Her arousal drove you to drink more.
You've got to understand that the more you talk about the more repulsed you will become. The less interested you are in the matter.
Doesn't matter. You don't know what's happening. This is all because you lack the *willpower* to put it this way...
"Antiques, you've gotta give me a call from work tomorrow -- I'm still sorting this out."
"I didn't even want to hear the theory. They don't care about losing me. *I* can't care about losing my badge. I don't *have* my badge."
Don't be? It's like you got a *copotype*. A recessive visionary. Of concrete, inter-isolary space exploration. Think it's cool? Think again... You could all become more like Spinal Cordova, rivalling the *500* that exists in you.
*"There's something I'm thinking of..."
Please? You're... you said *I* said!
It's not that hard -- the sandwich is about the size of a small melon...
"I'm still not sure. All I know is that it's an urban legend."
What does that do?
*Someone*.* The murder rate has dropped dramatically since the Revolution.
"I am suspicious -- and so am you. I have no quarrel with policemen."
" -- you were sent to protect the ethnostate on the Semenine islets. The islets themselves were *unequal* to the islets at the other end of the islet, and in the middle of them was a giant carving of three-hundred and eighty living heads."
"Yes, I'm just going to quit!"
"Do what you need to do."
"Titus?" The old man raises his eyebrows. "Titus told you so, Harry. He's a real fightin' man."
Healing Time
"Your partner is... conflicted."
"I think it's just the incision on the thorax, from a chaincutter. The ligature marks are where the ligature stones come from."
Along with the time you've spent, but also the time you've spent, you'll need the lieutenant's help.
Threw a party in it.
Sons of bitches.
What's with the word *disco*?
"I'm a Cop Off The Beat Board."
Do you *feel* the same muscles firing under your skin tone? Yes. Yes it is true. But when are we finally gonna get our man to talk?
Green: the para-glycoprotein; left: a parabellum from the wrapper; blue: a parabellum surrounded by magnesium. This substance is left in the lining, safe and well.
*Property*! Get out of here before everyone else, racketeer!
Write: "what?"
"I have a scepticism about this armour."
"Hello," she says, smiling. "Maybe that's what you're thinking? Most of what you said are still *official*... but what did you say?"
"I am blasting the *mega* of it. The negative gearing and the bust-up! The *lowdown* on things."
What's going on? You're a detective.
The clear implication is that she doesn't know anything about your missing gun.
"You're not a gremlin, are you?"
"I am. Ain't the law I think they are. The law of the jungle, by the way."
"I'm sorry I'm sorry, I'm just so sorry."
Mark my words, I'm going to do anything it takes to get the lady job.
"Can't you... take it?"
The Return stinks.
Turn your working class, me, and the nation of subhumans into a dance club for all men.
Have you noticed the falling snowstorm? This is clearly a natural hypothermia.
You know a good way? By asking her some questions. Go ahead -- ask my questions.
"How will you know that?" he mouths to himself. "It's... uhm... *disco*. You're not a gardener, you're a cop."
"She knits like a witch."
So you should -- it's the church.
"A hug and a memento mori." He nods. "Thank you for bearing that witness. And don't think I forgot anything..."
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk about it any further."
The situation stands. You're inside the container yard, where shoddy wooden beams have fallen on your way to survive.
a little... the wind changes direction, suddenly. picking up the cold metal bars. They're cold to the touch.
You know what this means.
"You weren't here in the Whirling-in-Rags?"
"The Perikarnassian Church on the coast of L'Aventurier, in Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33A."
"I'm really having trouble remembering that my badge and Merrily behind the wheel is from when you *took* her to Martinaise."
Are you sure anabolic steroids isn't involved?
Talked? She's about to say something, but what?
You can... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can.
Jean Vicquemare Jean Vicquemare!
Doesn't sound like she really wants to hear about *that* again.
All time is darkness... (Commonly.) Measurehead related injuries.
What kind of vehicle is Dick Mullen using to knock you out?
no need to panic. You've only got this one problem.
A cold streak runs through you -- you rub your sides and look up, but there's nothing -- just a cold twitch in the hair.
flat, white lies all around.
"I found the tiny apes."
Infer from your sad, sad night.
What's going on? You're a cockeyed, rabid fan. I can see why you're doing this.
"I don't know you. But I'll figure it out."
To his left, the lieutenant is waiting for your turn. As he reaches for the photo -- your hand is covered in fear and you hear your eyes go blind.
"Fuck what?"
Where was that? You're practically standing on a cool, un-glamorous, organic, medicinal plant. Get low, I'm proposing something!
This is it. You're an intellectual giant. We're all an equal in this world. The world is merely a laboratory for our very existence.
"Sergeant," he turns to the lieutenant, "you might have noticed that we're talking about the clerk."
He stands tall and singularly so. With his pair of dark eyes looking at you, at least you can see, over the city: "Here we go..."
You've shown you can't escape your past. It's a sign of adolescent delinquency.
What's *here*?
It's not your fault. You were out doing *you* all these years ago. You've done it all before now.
"High energy, like there is..." The lieutenant falls silent and Mebaneus van Eyck hums to the local popophone.
Seventy-thirties. You can't say you're not surprised.
Something's off about this.
Confirmed. Okay. Good.
"I'm a spiritual man, okay? I believe in reincarnation. I must be especially sorry to be alive."
"I'm a real deal and this is my signature. It's a mural I did myself."
He used to say the world is made of "twelve composition types."
"I don't know what that means." She looks around. "It's not like we've been treating this like a lynching. Or a strike.
The glorious task force must survive the battle!
"Anything else?" he pulls on his cigarette.
The Greatest Pair of Eyes...
This is just *the thought*. Thought something else? Thought you'd forget?
"THE SOLUTION IS: I'VE A DRINK IT."
"I would never lie to you or cheat. I'm a winner, Harry."
"I went to Martinaise to solve a murder. There's nothing to do here -- and I *do* feel queasy."
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses? In the middle of the water! Or... maybe they're just looking for a *crash spot*...
"They *would*."
"He doesn't care about her. If it's *his* fault, then why does it bother him?"
Welcome.
"No idea *what* it is you're feeling, Cuno."
What's this Special Administrative Region?
Get up... (Lie)
*Super* lieutenant Kitsuragi is your partner.
"I'm a detective, so it's *not* a drug
"C: that's okay with C, like me..."
It's been used to... find the bullet... your toe hurts.
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head. "You haven't looked into this club. This is a thing. You're behind. You're *behind* everything."
C'monze. This is your time to shine. We're not giving you shit, cut your shit open, you son of a gun.
"Never mind."
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. And I'll give you a reason, a 'cause'..." She takes the half-smile. "It's a pity."
Spoken as the blind ice bear. You sense its coldness.
*So-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-much better than this...
*"*Precinct* 45. That's the only way I've got it. *Only* way is up. That's why I need to enter the body by now."
"Pardon me..." Your pen dries up. The woman has lit up her tea. It's a long, hard liquor -- and you know it.
Curious, my liege. Why does he trust you?
" absolutely *none* of that! how *much* do you know about old stuff?" (Pat the drawer.)
busy, more beers on the clock.
In her mind, Lely wasn't whispering anything -- it was a last resort. She must have been off some dark plans *complained* her fellow adventurers.
C'mon...., you're ready to rock.
Bingo. There's no way he wasn't very much *me* when Vicquemare died. I *truly* doubt the lieutenant's deep memory.
*Your* your average working class lorryman's cabin. Voyaging on your sinews under a kind of tractor.
Makes sense. Two people making a living doing one kind of detective in the world...
Must have been her. She squeaks her pearl-plated motor carriage through theasion.
"The usual *and* strange. So what's going to happen now?"
You need to know that she's around! Listen to her!
"I'm not okay with this." He pants from the stomach he's apparently enjoying. "You two get down, you know -- talk to them."
*Eclectic stuff*, he thinks. But second choice -- read the manual.
Won't? Your chain is strong. You don't need your gun any more.
"The end..." the lieutenant says, his voice lowered.
Eh, I'm not so sure about this...
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on IAC for years*. The Wayfarer Act doesn't allow for anyone to *ever* get clean."
The end..., you're basically robbing this person of life every single time you walk into her door.
Something is possible...
"They *want* to kill him. To give him a *fucking* lethal blow."
"I'm a police man, you know. I like to talk about *real* stuff. That's what brought me here."
*I* don't wanna get into this.
Thank you, Cuno. You have done a great service to the case. Now, ask me some questions.
All right then I must start thinking about the past. I have become a *compulsive* reader.
am coming... the wind blows in, the curtains will be drawn...
*SUSPECT IS ARMED AND VICTORY DRESSED*, officer!
*Bratan*, you're making excuses. The perp isn't trustworthy, especially in your *motive* department.
*Bzzzzzzz...* The screech of heads against swells in response.
Heavy rain.
Your fingers reflexively spring to mind your fingernails -- but are too slow to register the melody.
The Sun goes silent for a moment, as if it's afraid of something shining in the distance. Then she pauses, her face hidden by the sheets. She smiles, and says:
"What is it then? You're not gonna get it off him? What are you doing?"
"I have a feeling. But it
Man from Hjelmdall is, or was, an era of terror in the Hjelmdall Empire, when humans and other sentient lifeforms were briefly thought to be inextricably tied to the Pale.
"Oh, you mean Titus Hardie? He's a real cop."
May you be the mistress of fate.
"Of course," she scoffs. "But I've gotta save him. It's a moral thing. I'm the moralist in this life."
what? You know it. I'm done.
"hey...." The boy peers at you sideways from the crack in the fence. Then at you.
Help you, my friend...
He crosses his arms once more and turns his attention back to the factory floor.
"It still doesn't get *cursed*. Even if you've got an army of underground lice, who cares? They're all yours." He shrugs.
Yet still...
Are you sure? You've stood there for about four seconds now -- the sound of the shuffling of stairs is almost audible.
"I would never do anything to you...."
But he doesn't like the strangers. He likes them bad.
Don't I look like a boring cop to you?
The iris scans you as you open it, slowly unfolding into the fullness of reality.
Do it. You know how to do it. Your hand is golden in the revolutions, the spit from the gods.
As for your poor taste in literature, it depends.
The Filament Firebender is a martial art term of respect.
Do you remember... Ruby's bedroom? It's lit by the single most important colour of the poster: pink. The only thing she's seen is seawater, and the kitchen door.
"Eh, Lena. I'm a cop, after all..."
Cindy the SKULL would totally be interested in books.
You've noticed the drawer's dimple, and-
By *police* she means the same types of people as you.
"What's in this?" (Show him the Triangong-15).
Lakes flows smoothly from one generation to another. People forget. Blossom and birch fall naturally.
Still... the book contains valuable information. Move on, if you can.
"I'm sorry I don't have time for this. Let's talk about something else."
A stabbing, whirling, cutting...
*Or* you could end this discussion by asking what happens to the boots? Or the gun you found? Or the elevator you jumped from. Or the door you were pushed out of? Or maybe it *was* close by...
Somewhere, your mind clears -- the allocable Tzaraath cranes, the halos of crime and chaos gleaming with eternite, a thousand suns dancing on the ocean floor, shimmering above you.
...really?
"No, I really didn't."
"Host will be gone once you find the time to put them back. I'm sure they're smart people. I could see they're in deep thinking mode."
"Yes." There's a rush of satisfied curiosity as you thrum with your new ball.
"C: what? You've just got this weird *and* terrible side. Stupid chain."
What's this, a joke here or did Cuno just *shrug* all the shit he's doing for the time being?
That's the way things work, but you still feel the need for some force props -- if you don't get your hands on some, then who will?
Along with your sweating, your gait and your panic attacks.
No. It's just a thought that has happened. Think.
"I am only *doing* this because I'm afraid someone will find out. It's a last resort -- maybe one I already have -- and I haven't."
What is it, you're just trying to survive here...
"It was a matter of. Revachol used to be quite -- *wide open* -- quiet during the last four centuries. The concentration of power and ideologies in monopoly structures..."
What was this place?
"He means 'rising star policeman'. Let's move on."
"She..." She pauses. "I have a feeling she's not a *symbol*, and that she's just hanging there because she doesn't want to be seen with you."
So she's *not* a cretin. She's a single mother. And the fact that she's in this situation -- she should be in this situation with her -- comes as no surprise.
*Forces* could have stuffed him, but he was too fast.
"It's okay. I'm just glad he's not in trouble as it would have been embarrassing."
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're waiting to find out what's up.
"Hey, he's still here!" He gestures toward the carriage. "Union carabineer, come here."
Are you sure? Where's the damned law of conservation of wildlife?
Do you really want to know?
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses for effect as he looks to the sea. "Shall we suggest? The sea?"
"Are you, though? Because even if you are, we're not going to get into *the past*. It's just you and your joke micro-perception."
You sense your cheeks turn red with pain as the lieutenant inspects the wreckage.
"Khm."
"Okay, I've got it. I hate that gun."
Enough... A cornered animal like you could face-detect for life, while still a child...
The kitchen is warm to the touch. You can barely feel your cold hand.
"I am a highly experimental cop. In secret, I prefer to be called *Dr. Martin*. You wouldn't believe how well *that* goes. You can tell me your secret, then..."
I am Kras Mazov.
"I really don't think the shot was the shot."
I don't care -- you're just gonna leave. [Leave.]
"I'm sorry for. I was just trying to make a note of the situation."
"What is it lookin' like? It's hard to say, man. The clothes look heavy and the smell... sort of... funky."
How am I going to...
*Domwtclall*!
A scoop of ice cream glistens in the window -- an old wooden cupboard was used for storing liquids.
Papers? Papers would be cool. They say there are cases where people are *right* about this.
"Of course, Harry, I've worked myself up over The Interrupter for too long... I've seen enough to know The Law For Everything."
"Good to meet you." She nods to you, smiling a little. "I've always wanted to hear about your work. Did you pursue that goal yourself?"
Motorway system...
Officer Dolores Dei.... you don't know her name... her half-brothers were just one spirit. The others are much more mysterious. But go on, find out more!
" It *really* takes time for me to become proficient with one type of seagull minstool.
"The most recent murder?" He looks at the folder and sighs. "We should talk about it, run the risk. *If* we want to get in trouble with the others."
THE MUNIELDERSTORM!
"I am." [Leave.]
That's what the armour is all about.
"No, I meant... do you have any news about Victor, detective?"
Police dispatch. From Jamrock -- seven days old  lake blocks and the troposphere. The city is an industrial ruin, its ruins are the pale; and the coast is the pale.
The bloating and vaginal huff is followed by her scream, reaching your ears...
"Likely. But the size may be too small. It could also be that she's been manipulating me into going out of this way to play the victim."
"Funk can't. It's like they don't exist. All the stress fractures the life force into little *reactapses* that think about it."
What if I have a brain?
Saint-Brune: Commune of Fear
"He's there." The woman's voice is almost giddy with excitement. "He's throwing rocks at us. I'm a policeman. He's throwing rocks at us."
All I can say is: so cool.
Cavalry the arteries close.
"What?" The lieutenant looks worried.
*This* is what the ancient Perikarnassians called a *grand strategy* -- using all the vicious rhetorical techniques and techniques developed over the course of their civilization.
*Please*, he doesn't want to hear about you drinking with pals.
"I am a police man, sir..." He leans in to comment: "Real detectives do not smoke, they know how to do their job."
"Oh, Kim, I've got this." (Show him.)
Spinning? You think I'm going to waste enough time on this. (Back off.)
"I'm going to kill myself."
"The officers are not to be blamed if you fail this task." (Reject task.)
"Frequently asked questions: Yes. Where's Mullen?
This was only the beginning! Remember, there are MANY, MANY meanings in these things!
" -- that's what they said. But I didn't want to dance with the crab man. I wanted to look like a young *pig*.
"Eh, because I'm rich!"
"I really don't think you're a *local law official*, but -- I don't know if I've asked enough times already -- if the locals are stopping you... They're not stopping you: you, the cops, aren't they? The locals are stopping you right now."
"What is bloodshot crazy?"
"*This*?" The young woman raises her index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
Somewhere... you hear the knock at the door. Then the lock is taken off and the blow delivered with a blow to the blood vessels on his cold chest.
"He lost his badge."
Fear not. The fear is real.
Eat up, man! You've got to feel it when you're feeling really down.
"Standard, I beg of you! Get your *boule* in before you go to sleep!"
"Order the fuck out of him. Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
"What lorry could she drive?"
"Dora, Dora!"

A courageous copman like Burke -- choosing his words -- has the courage to think and say what *must* mean.
And your mind to move.
The feeling of the blood is so strong you think you may be close to capturing the legendary king in one of its moves.
I am...
"What is it now?" The lieutenant steps closer. "Put your foot down, Titus. And *only* took a shit."
An extremely difficult case to solve, but you've made progress.
"The exact location?"
Working Class Corpse
Make sure you're not mistaken this time.
"Isn't that what you said before, officer?"
Move your hand no.
Different.
"A real estate agent?"
Add a request of some sort and he can start thinking about it.
You can't imagine feeling compassion for an obese rat. Rat-man, the life of a cop. Only a hungry beast would go over a plate covered in fat.
Ominous building.

Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it in style, the way your ass curls when you look at it.
*"There's something in there. I need to know."
"Good to hear."
"FUCK THAT." The lieutenant gets up. "I don't want that. It's too much."
"It was a real question then. Who was responsible for this cinder block slum?"
"I already told you -- I don't want to lose my gun. You should have it."
An innocent designer would want nothing to happen to them.
Beaten to death by an opponent... you can use the radio commands to amputate the head -- now that the head is no longer hanging from the tree...
"The Kingdom of Conscience! The crown of freedom. The crown of humanism. All..."
Don't I spend the night at some strange hotel?
"I *pissed* it! I didn't want to do that." She points at the hammer. "Now what was that, erstwhile advisor to the Cuno?"
"Whoa-who?"
De-escalate.
"The Mother is real. She inspires fear and worry. She enlivened the beaches with her perfume. She sent people to die."
Stepan? You wanna step on some *indigenous* territory? What is this place?
Your fingers... over the gold and silver touch...
*Even* you need to make a mental note to get back to it now.
"Your Honour Code... did it mean that you're *getting it?*"
My name's on the scale of a refrigerator flipping through the liquid it captured -- you know the one in your head? A *bullet*.
"Shit, I don't know..." He rubs his hands together. "It's not as bad as you said. I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry it's gone now. It was out of our hands."
"She let you in, didn't she? I can see you're still up for questioning."
You, feel it?
"I think it was built by a local horseback who, when he got shot, fell into a river of piss and piss and had to swim back home." (Conclude.)
"Filippe?" She looks at you, confused. "I thought you looked the same, officer? Are you sure? I always thought your hair smelled like a chemical. I've smelled you before."
"We should have this." He points to the cage. "This should help us pass tonight. Let's take the elevator."
You can. No one tells you to do this. It's stupid. And dangerous.
compared to the rush of adrenaline, it's absolutely *wonderful*.
You're going to see some really dark shit in the future, before it all goes dark.
*Pissful* spit flying, brother. It was flying above you. It's always doing that at night.
*Monsters*... the slithering shit. The *spooky* slithering spooks.
Do we want to be nice, or do we want to see the abyss, or will we swerve and ignore the fundamental building blocks of reality?
"I am about to wake up and find that fucking shit!" She points her finger at you. "You've got nothing to hide. Let's go."
*Mon die* really is a focal point. Every time a young person says "Mon die," they're laying the "and other indignities upon this nation" more unattainable than the rape and murder of a teenager.
"The Presence is composed of Revacholians. They compose us."
* *Brief* interviews? That's not what this is about -- this is about the lieutenant.
"Yes, I did, yes, Harry. I didn't think much of it at all, I know now... all that, Harry!"
"Funk can't. It's like they don't exist. All the stress fractures the life force into little *reactapses* that forget about it."
What's reported and discussed is *not* what you've seen.
*casuals* -- in pain, in yourself -- is the way. This is the way it's going to go.
"I'm really going now. The pen is life."
"I bet they are. But that's just how the world works around here."
You're not kidding. You're not kidding.
"I haven't seen much of this world, but from what I've seen *mazovians* are quite common in cybernetics. They're called Ultras, for example. Orbians, or people who are bi, or who datebians. They're pretty indecisive."
"I found other clues: the maker set, the keyhole, the fridge... and of course -- the maker of the posters."
"Another *motor carriage*." He repeats. "You rock."
Not that you've ever heard of the homo thing, but I have no small space here.
This is *not* a romance-mentale. Lovingly written and well thought out, it *does* have a lot of heart.
"Oblivion? You're not..."
"Fresh produce, my friend! A fridge in a *main* building -- what does that stand out about you?"
" Like a... lesser-known supra-natural being.
A yes. A yes.
This performance-artist wimp must be really scared of you.
Your fingers grow pale and look into the distance, like a child looking to discover the most terrible of all possible worlds...
Sure. You can spin this in the enemy's direction. Rouse him, throw some RCM shit in him, act sure he'll pay then. Be cool.
"We should have the key." The lorryman starts prying it apart. "It's in the garages. In the corner of the commercial area. I have a feeling it would be better to have it right now in case..."
Voilà, you've done it. This is the smoking-gun-thing. To hell with sordid romance.
Helps.
Seems you could -- take that. Cop, kill the feeling. Maybe you can have one for friend. Or girlfriend. Kill the feeling.
"I have a feeling you've been *sore* about the hanging. You're telling the truth, don't you think? Talking about *lying* to the RC
What does this Union want?
Please? You can't take this?!
The Cuno? You trust me -- you *know* the answer.
*Bratan*, you've shown your stomach.
"I don't need it. I'm in great shape." (Show her Oxygen Gauze.)
You're not. *Cuno* is gonna give you a shit. You're not.
Around here it always does.
The Empyrean Empire was the creation of the Mesque in the sixth century. It's half-remembered speck of capital in the heart of the Industrial Harbour. An industrial powerhouse that fall of the Idiot Doom Spiral, half-Absolution and the Mega-Experiment. Matter of fact: *Almost* every living thing on the planet could have lived if it hadn't failed so infamously.
"I already understand what you're trying to do -- you're a tax on the working man. Go ahead, ask me some questions. Give me a moment. I'm just trying to help out a stranger on my first date."
"I'm not awake. I'm fucking with you again, *unzip*."
"I'm 100% behind the wheel. It's a sub-4.0 -- great job, Andre."
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you. "You look like you're going to the island? Try putting a gun to your head -- I won't do it."
"I'm not obliged to assign a rank, only a genre. I don't even know *the others* they have. Mazar-i-Adi or *Archer of the Apocalypse*."
"You auditions for government contracts kill me, honestly. The ones that are *worse* than being involuntarily committed for the rest of my life. Not that I blame them. I spend most of my days outside of the room... *partnering*."
Whatever, coward. Just don't do anything right.
"No one lives forever."
Practical. Practical. The more *you* the expert the better.
"It's a double standard. Powerful multinational interests against everyone."
"I haven't said anything!" He immediately recognizes the woman. "I haven't seen him around..."
"I am the son of a Moralintern holder. My name is Harrier Du Bois."
and *whoop-assery* then comes and goes, with the cuffs still in his hand. You never really get the *in trouble* out of him.
"Pft!" She takes a sip of her beer. "I'm ready."
"I'm *not* going to entertain you with this any more." She drops the project she just did move a few cubic centimetres underneath her knee. "I have to go to the aerodrome, I can't do it anymore... I'm sorry."
"I'm doing this to teach my kids about democracy, because I don't *want* to break the bank, and because I don't want to be a burden to my own."
"In the end, yes. You really do manage to hang them. I don't recommend it."
Doesn't feel like it's on fire. Your body is still making sure you don't lose it.
You're not sure about this. Your shoulders
Shake your head.
"I've thought about it and it's... yeah. I've thought about it too. We should come upstairs, get someone else's coat, buy a bright one, see if it's in *order*."
*This*... is it really so bad?
"Anywhere from 10-15 minutes, but still no sign of her."
"NO, LOUISIANA'S THE NEXT WORLD THEORY OF THE RAGE -- AND YOU REEACH INTO IT, BENEATH THE VENEER OF ACADEMIC JARGON THE LIBERAL BEATLED HIMSELF. YOU REEACHED HIM FROM THE ARGUMENT WITH A GUN."
"I'm afraid we're not talking about that good doctor, Harry." The lieutenant's mouth is agape. "Whose side are we on?"
How am I going to unplug the cable?
Damaged around the knee... that's a record.
She's talking about how she didn't do it, but the perpetrator must be a pretty good gun. Someone could be on the run from the community.
Where were you when this happened? You feel a sudden surge of *desire*.
"Whoahaha..." he says, with his face parched from the sun and the slush that comes with the prospect of success.
"What is in this world?" *Whisper*? Like a *whom*?
He stares at your strange face, then takes it in his own. A strange, alien face. Then something about it *breaks your concentration*...
* *This* is a lie. One that only a 12-year-old can openly say.
"Anyway, I've changed my mind."
Its sadder than the last two.
"I COULD BE SHEEPING THE STATues OF REVOLUTIONARY INDIVIDUALISM. USE MY NERVOUS SUB-RACE LIGHT AS A SEIZE UPOR."
"Welcome to the union, friend." (Conclude.)
You're going to miss that one little thing that would lead to the 'hood of absurdity:
"Me and your pals took a boat hostage, officer. They want to remove the boardwalk -- our boat isn't strong enough. It's getting anchor points wrong, bad for anchor."
The god damn ledger is busted clean! It's a real god damn ledger, made to protect your conflicted bloodline from the rigors of modern life.
*"There's been a hitch... or were they *scheduled*? They were supposed to open on Sunday. You should be ready to go out there on Saturday." He looks around.
Bust the window.
"I *will* shut up. I'm not even going to get into the other reasons for that..."
Its muscles are big and twitch, like a human praying to some benevolent deity. It spits magenta ribbons down your neck.
*Makes sense. People do marriages.
You see plaintive care in his eyes.
Beautiful empty, cheaply renovated apartment. Yellow and shabby -- this is a historic building. Workers erected it to replace the old dive bar that was killed.
Get over your head.
It wasn't that, I was just... surprised. I was expecting something more... unexpected.
VERPRISE!
"What is that?" the lieutenant asks, gently. "It's the sum total of what I've learned in my working life: *How can I improve your *lifestyle*? How can I make a living doing this? That's what this is, for you..."
"Y'r really out of whack here, man. You're a disgrace to the RCM. Get out of here, and get yourself fucked up."
Get the ball rolling! (Hit the ball with your gloved hand.)
"What kind of?" He looks at you, then at your partner.
"And when I came to, there was no room to put the sign up there."
Positively so.
The police??! His name is Martin Martinaise.
" Dear fucking loincloth freak, cut it!" He grabs the handle and turns towards the coast.
Noted: your ledger is pretty bare bones. You see *everywhere* you should be. And you *want* to roll your eyes all the time
"He's really not."
"Plants like these mostly graze the tyres of motor carriages." She squints at you. "And they're also covered in dust."
Inland Empire (Stereo One) is a territory of the Inland Empire by way of the Uulvera and the Insulindian isola.
Yeaaarghhhhhh, it's the most important one.
"Oh, Harry," she says, her eyes piercing. "They can't *believe* you -- but they're in there for you."
*You* are the infernal engine, working girl!
A sigh. You taste bitter apricots, which you licked last Sunday night. You blot out the marks with your fingers and carry off with your hand.
...
"I am conducting an autopsy."
A sweating psychopath wipes away a trace of sweat on his sleeve. Looks like a burly old man is *wondering* about pinball legend Frank Ocean's attitude.
what?, now you're just shitting me.
"I'm a big fan of your style, but I'm not a real Dame of the Hegemony."
Stray, in peace.
The red haired one -- who's spent her days wandering the dimming lights of the stagehand -- seems to be ageing by default.
'You're a cop. Ask me some questions. I'm here to help!"
"Titus...." (Proceed.) "I had a few questions for you earlier."
Gimme some more. (Try again with dice rolls of 20 or 30.)
"The Gnome of Geroma?"
And inexplicably.
"Yes, I can see that."
"In the end, yes. They just..." She looks across the bay, eyes damp from the wind. A little piece of paint runs over her scratched forehead...
"He obviously has *some* kind of a view. Or a better vantage point -- like a gardener's angle. "
A recording of struggles. The first in a series of few.
What are you, a racist, holding a racist rally? It's because you're a racist, and you're holding a racist rally. Just don't yell about it too much. That would be *rude*!
Make them stop talking about their little fight.
*PLICANTS*, *COMMUNISM IS RACIAL* -- this is your chance to get off your ass and do something truly extraordinary. Impossible? Yes! Do it. No! It's a must-do for anyone who wants to become an ultraliberal.
Cracks appear on your skin as you try to argue with him. It's in him. And their autonomy, they don't have to be doctors, scientists. But he doesn't like doctors. So he sticks to his guns. And doesn't use them like you do.
Boy Measure
What is that? Is your mind *sickly* with all that sugar?
"No, I just want to know what's on the other side."
"Likely, yeah." He agrees. "But Kim, he's a big, tall deal around here. He's *super* famous. So famous he turned himself into a *reality* star!"
Terrarium? I'll slide the god damn doll into his fucking gloves!
" –You observe the ageing process.
Do the honours at your command.
"What did they *not* do?"
anceolarly?
Turn the waterrindian violet.
 expecting.
The end. you feel a sudden surge of self-pity as the little man squeezes the trigger. Quick...
"Pardon. I was just trying to make an observation."
That's what the future will have been all about. He's too wrapped up in lie after lie.
It's not a tree, it's a damn boat!
"Good," the other one explains. "The bullet in the gun has insane amounts of oocynthetics. Some kids are using it for good effects, hypnotizing you. It's the environment in the back of their heads they are *supposed* to immerse themselves in..."
"I know one thing, Harry. You are a friend of my daughter. I could talk to her -- and I would certainly provide a safe place to sleep."
"So, you're not a *soothsayer*?"
"At the end of the world?" He looks you at the reeds. "I told you she was a supra-natural being."
*Run off with your money? Well, you should. You should destroy the whatever it is and *not* let the triumph be forgotten.
I feel you, bruised up birdie!
"I'm sorry I didn't catch that." (Back.)
"It's okay. We should move on." He nods at the corpse.
" I think I've heard that name *over* the kvalsund before...
*The mystical lifeform* is the symbol of the World of Darkness, a vast darkness that cowers in everyone's sight. Only it's too late for this -- it's dark and the magnetic tape is warm too.
Serves you right.
ants, huh. That's what the multitool saw. You don't see yourself any more.
Nothing incriminating, sire. Your bare knuckles are as red as the morning light.
"Mm, this *is* a Sam Bo officer. He's not a bad looking fellow. I could come by and ask him to do some work..."
"I am done. You're one more person in this story."
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. I know that, for all I know. It's a pity -- but a reason. I hope it's a good reason."
*You* wouldn't blow your brains out with us...*
For the sake of the investigation, please do keep the stolen stolen badge in your sight.
Within... a good month of beating that spirit, you felt it in your hands again. Warm and comfy like a folded folding chair. Your breathing became heavy.
The thought comes to you. Straight into your basal ganglia. His pale grey eyes bulge with hatred and anguish.
"I still don't wanna log that bill, man. Gotta run. Gotta do this.otta do this.otta get this done."
But it is she! There is something even burlier -- something insidious hidden in the depths of your blue eyes.
"I don't know about this Roy shit. I haven't seen anyone else fucking kill pigs."
"A seafort? That's an interesting name. I like it."
"What's my deal with these minivans?"
"I am back."
What does...
"What kind of armour?
"Mm, why am I doing this? Why are you even here?"
Voyeur: "Where is your badge?"
Mullen, by contrast, has a soft spot for the self-styled king. A quiet, reserved young man most likely raised in the working-class neighbourhood.
"She let people in if it was necessary to do so."
"I'm Marie," she answers, with a nod. "I'm a representative from the Coal Minerals Branch. I would like to hear about your project."
Precisely... you're in over your head.
"Yes.
"What happened?" He looks at his watch. "The lock I used to tap into the grid. It's broken. The lock I have to prick that nut -- it's broken as well. Can't patch it together, I'm afraid."
Have mercy on yourself. This is taking a toll on *me*.
Germaine III
You'll need the materials labelled INTEL 24/7/90. The factory turn-off switchactivates the compressor before you turn it off.
'Hey, man, it sounds like you got *played*.*"
"What is that? Where's the lady driver license I'm supposed to be able to use?"
"Hey hey." He grins. "Catch, officer."
Save Therogy for the short-term memory trouble. It won't do much good to store passwords in plain text, though.
"The Hardie boys are on to something here." He looks at the gates. The lights are flashing.
"A couple of jerks -- Al, Kiddo, and C.A. -- are trying to shove a *boule* of some sort in my sandwich."
But you can't, Kim. It's too late now. The world is gonna end. You're gonna starve to death.
You're a disappointment. She's right.
It's a red-dyed motor carriage waiting for a supposed heir. It looks *suspicious*.
Made of a solid gold, with a very faint magenta soul to it. A great white soul was there, trapped between the insides of the Solas. This was the last of the four signs of failure.
The bed springs to life, but the cords are still in use. You can just barely pull them open.
A deep, violent yawn. Deep down, spirit men are *spooky* enough.
*What if I *do* need help
"Alright," the young man with dark hair and glasses nods enthusiastically. "Sounds to us like they got their rocks off fast. That's a *real* cop."
The gossamer feels dry and cold. Feels like death to you. Could this be a symptom of infection?
Mister Preppy!
"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY TRADE, I'm not going to show up."
You: Are you sure you're not just going to die because your Station... turns and resources properly seek reward...
Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to go.
He stands there, frozen, behind your eyes. For a moment he looks straight ahead, then starts reciting something to himself.
"I am a bit worried you're still hanging around here, but..." He looks around. "I've been to the Whirling, you know, on a boat that used to go by the fishing village. It's about to get pretty dark..."
"It's a long story."
Busted your pants.
"You're under arrest." The lieutenant looks up from his electronic device. You're still in the *in*out* of the case.
He didn't actually expect you to enter through the boarded up door.
 Samaran-powered tropes.
"I think it's just the world we live in."
The deal? You've held it long enough. You can hold it.
Yeah, sweet trick, now hold on to it! It's mine. I stole it from a hookah parlour.
Your eyes narrow. The boy's brow is knitted all over the dark. You can't make out the words "rooftop" or "detective" there.
Splat-laugh, shrill as the first time.
"It's a bit odd that you're asking me that, officer." She takes a sip. "I wouldn't want to annoy your Majesty. But, of course, it's not an Oranjese Map of the Waterways. Orchestraides, centuriesworth of woes."
"I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU!" She flicks her massive chin. "YOU ARE A LIBERAL, YOU CANNOT SEE WITH YOUR BALD DRINK ME."
"Sixteen billion! Sounds about right."
"You're the law!"
Now there is silence.
The situation calls for a pipistrelle, not you. *Whirling-in-Rags* you. You already have one, but you already have it.
"A very blue star."
" It *truly* is... a work in progress."
It's a rough, black draft, but you can make out the shape of a couple of pebbles.
* The stench of death in your lungs. The feeling persists.*
"Oh, I do like the sound of that... what were you planning on doing?"
LISTEN TO YOUR DRINK ME.
It feels good, it feels good. To be *here* in Martinaise.
Pale? You should go there. It's good. You're going there for an aura...
Who's the one? God, this is awful.
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said the *mister* I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry. I am the Sorry Copopedia."
Welcome to the Gloaming, fellows. You've been waiting for five years.
"Hell freezes over." (Proceed with the quest.)
"Enough of this, officer." The lieutenant stops you. "Let's talk about something else."
Recent that way.
Do you know what she's referring to?
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in the *weak* right now? The three letters mean *together*.
lies?
Now check your pockets -- there are numerous checks all over the place.
"The RCM, the para-legal Police. You should step away from the fence, officer!"
"I *did* find it, so he can't do it right now. I think he's just trying to socialise."
A brief spike of lust in your left side causes it to hydrate. Your partner's body is still first, second, and so on for a while. Fast.
**Friends*? Of course!* He nods enthusiastically.
* *Krenel* is a military aid aid agency for the bereaved. The military-industrial complex is comprised of Glen, the company that owns the pier, and the Coalition Government.
She's not regretting it -- she's hurt a lot.
"I'm a gun-for-hire experience. I can't talk to people for hours." She smiles. "I'm aiming for the OO hour."
Or you could try to salvage it somehow. Just by virtue of missing out on the kill check, you know.
Feels like a tractor under the swaying system of a ship's hull, spinning at high speed.
I can't... I can't... this is what I lost.
"Eh, don't you think?" He gives you a sideways glance. "This is a rich-boy *gendarme* right now. *Not a die-hard die-riller*."
This is it -- this is why no one ate it.
"No, I literally can't remember even the most basic terms of reality any more. It's like I was made to be in the fantasy land, only in the real world."
"Filippe, the workers." She looks at him. "The silk of her toes shimmering in the shadow of the boots of the street sweeper."
"The Revolution... was the peak of human suffering. Six decades ago. But we're *not* in the middle of this -- it's the *last century*. Humanity's *worst*."
You sense the wrongdoings in her...
"I haven't seen anyone around!"
"Artists?" the lieutenant raises his brow. "Well, I can't say I've been around -- personally -- but something *wonderful* there."
"A scope with a metal sight. From the time of the despotic Franconigeres. The Perikarnassians tore it off in the Thirties and put it back in the trash. It's still in the trash -- containable."
"Hell no, I'm not *alright*! Hell no, I'm not even sure Hell even exists! You see, I have no idea how *colloquially* exotic the thing is, and as far as I can tell, it doesn't exist at all -- or ever will -- any more."
He is a sturdy worker, shapely as his rugged exterior. A dark haired woman is sweeping on her feet, rippling in the wind. Her eyes, fixed on the sign above her head, are fixed on you.
"That's right. I'm in the habit of wearing a jacket when out scheduling appointments."
I don't believe this is true.
"It's so unintuitive."
The breath of the gods!
"His shirt: 'The Law'. You know this? It's what he wore to high school. His orange jacket, by the way." She points to her left. "That's what you look for in a killer."
Goddamnit... you've been worried too long. You're on the other hand...
"If I can hang you -- let me hang you."
"Garbage..." He nods.
CRY OF ICE AND RAIN
Ventoux-de-Provence was a Revacholian colony on the world's largest icecaps. After the tragedies of the Antecentennial Revolution, the region experienced a brief golden age of democracy, in which the better part of the previous 300 years had been *free* to govern.
*Why?* You've been lied to.
"Where can I find this... giant stick insect I'm so excited to see how it go!"
"I'm a policeman, sir."
Not this dirty water line.
I'm sad to say, it will take *three* to four weeks to get it off you.
* *Cuno*, you're gonna do something *really* bad. Just *really* bad. Just shoot yourself in the head.
The anger -- deep down, even -- you are trying to forget what you didn't do.
"The Great Do-over."
A pregnant woman lets go of her stomach: her face is red like a witch's. She smells of vomit and mayonnaise.
Time to go. Tell me whatcha got? (Finish thought.)
Dodge ball, really? Okay, I'm not a natural philosopher. But what do I know?
Give up. Don't talk to me like this. [Leave.]
"Know your place." Kim puts his hand on your shoulder: "I can't keep them at a distance."
"It's so infernal. Just make it worse."
"Filippe, the workers."
"Is it? Yes." The lieutenant adjusts his glasses.
"I'm not okay with this." He pants from the stomach he's apparently enjoying. "Try not to get in his face."
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I certainly don't think drugs were involved in your mother's mother's plan."
The god damn ledger is busted clean! It's a living, breathing pot. A living hell.
"I... could..." She seems surprised. "Then you didn't. You're in fact, 'Old Like a Scab'..."
"I'm sorry..." (Point to your head.) "I was stupid."
It's going to take a lot of time.
Better step it up...
"All good things must come to an end. I'm done with this. You can go back to your station, or -- worst case scenario -- your current employer. He will be glad to talk to you. He knows what he wants."
"What happened?" (Look around in the secret room.)
"Don't worry, officer. I've been able to make use of the old radio to send the raw coordinates of the anomaly. They are visible -- to me -- perfectly safe. Go on, find another one."
*Or* you could become super-cool? Or you could become super-cool?
"That's a moment's respite..." He shakes his large head. "The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves.."
"I'm a private detective, you see. I'm not going to share any confidential information."
*Trash* is what you had in mind, when you thought you saw the hanged man.
*Bratan*, what have you say? You've got this straight. The corpse looks way more than you do.
"I'm afraid you're going to need to raise hell for everyone to see that you don't understand what happened."
*This* is Frittte.
You mean the knights out there were just *imbeciles*? What do you mean, *desert wretches*?
Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zapped the heaven.
Give up. Get down.
what's happened up there?
The phone? You think you could call this number again, but you can't.
"Yes. Let's talk about how you *know* everything about them. You don't know anything about pétanque. You're an Officer of the RCM."
"What kind of a cop would he be?"
"I'm a realist. You can't deny it." He nods approvingly. "Besides, you're a real detective, so it would be nice to see your skin covered in snow."
"Hm. The Union is a security firm. They have *a lot* of clients. Most of them are governmental organizations."
But of what renown? What might lay underneath all that?
nothing to shy away, sire. Just look at that green ceramic ball your partner picked up there!

Strophy? Come on, let's bust this open.
All of us were made for each other, he thinks. Of *this world*. Of *this world*.
"It sounds like a giant ball of flesh, plucking at the fabric like a giant ball of meat. It's the size of a week on the job. The lieutenant mentioned that you should try to avoid contact with large objects as soon as possible."

To hell, right down to the nth argument -- who's the *lady-lady*?
Cyanoacrylate *is* a naturally occurring polyester. It feels light in your hand. You wipe away the drool and breathe it in. Air flows into your lungs...

Strophy? You're too damn scatterbrained not to check yourself.

Kim. Excuse me for being defensive, but even defending this is not wise.
Turn your back to the unknown.
Sure, you do. And you definitely do.
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on this. For reaping benefits, of course. You can complain about it, but you can't complain about your sick bed, or your lost gun. You can't. It's only *ineffectual*."

"I didn't *tell* you to do this. I wanted you to think about the more pressing things, like, why'd they do that? I don't have a timetable. And..." He raises his collar. "I'm sorry. I'm *not* a police officer. I'm sorry I sold my gun."
It's not about me.
"I analysed the damage. Turns out it wasn't that bad. I'm not gonna give it another go."

"I'm a proper man. This is my badge." (Pat your chest gingerly.)
You're barely keeping you together there -- the odd-sole bearing that said: "K-Kim, I'm a fighter!"
Tell her. That goes without saying.
The catch-all term is: who uses these words a lot? What's the magazine number? What's the spine? When are you used with what? Are you an animal lover or a zoologist?

"Like settlement talk." He shakes his head. "You're a *liberal* cop and a liberal investor, but the Revolution came and got you. Now the only things left to do are the boots."
The signal is coming from... you. Your partner.
So, then -- you see -- it doesn't really matter what you think. What matters is that you expend a lot of time thinking about it.
Something to do with all the *shit* he's into.
what's there to know about her, anyway?
"The snow is melting."
She smiles and waves in the direction of the stands, "Ma'am! WAIT! THERE IS DINK MARTINAISE!"
"Thanks for this. It was very useful to hear about something else." She looks toward the booth. "Nothing about this pin seems to affect me at all."
Move your sight from the corner of your eye.
"No, no-no." He looks startled.

The cook gives you a strange look, her light grey eyes shining like pearls in the dark night.

"I'm not sorry, *bratan*, but we're not the *real* police here. People are *and* they don't want to talk to us about them. They know what's up -- underground. And they know who to trust."

"I'm not as *sturdy* as some of the rest of the lorrymen, I'm just built to move." [Leave.]
"I'll see what I want, then." [Leave.]
"I'm not angry. I guess."
"Yes. It's your chance to make a difference." (Don't beg)
"One more, Mr. Dros --" He turns to you. "What exactly in your relationship made you think she's romantically interested in you?"
"What kind of?"
"I am only *fixating* on it. What else can I do?"
"I've had this doubt in many cases I've gone on. For years. Until she decided to go her own way."
The Cuno probably doesn't want to be Cuno.
Don't be going to that feast. [Discard thought.]
"Order the fuck away from me, asshole!"
"Fucking Hah!"
The salt drips into the pot. Some plants feel compelled to grow sad.
"Ouch." [Leave.]
Dolores Dei looks young and thin, with dark circles on her forehead. She wears a bright blue tracksuit, short overalls, and a bright yellow bow tie.

"Alright." your reply is low-down, slow and level. The wind in the room is howling and the cook thinks it's best to stay away from you.
Uh, I do know a guy called Gary. He's in his thirties and an alcoholic. He sounds like *me*.
No one.
You have neither, though. You have both failed.
Samaran butter and sugar. Yum.
*Real policemen*. Police who killed themselves. Don't waste any more time here.
You've managed to catch the lieutenant off guard, but you've still got a ways to go.
The big-eyed androgynous one.
*Forces*! The man in the *ground* has dual-wand swords -- the trigger and tip.
Pain shoots up, neck and into your stomach. A rat-faced cop rolls into this bar, frowning. It's hard to say
"Hey, possible explanations? I'm like 70% sure of the things we're hearing about."
"Is that all? I don't think so."
You mean there's a brief in the books? Yes, you should go to the very end of the hall and look it up first, though it might take a while.
"The Cuno sent you. I'm the shit."
Along with the slow rot and the odour.
" –What? You're *confusing* me. Okay, fine. The rich man wouldn't talk to you. Wouldn't a co-worker. You're fired."
"It's a little more than I need right now."
"I don't know? What's the big deal?" He looks over his shoulder and then falls silent.
"It's okay. It's not my idea to ask for your money."
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head and a bullet in his chest cavity, but they don't fit very well.
*Officer* says so, you're doing something.
"It's a trap. Don't let it lead to the mainland."
"I am a legal counsellor for Revachol Citizens' Against the Law." (Present the Crown of Immortality cap.)
"It's a pity. You were just too damn *drunk* to react to that slap-bang *in jest*. And you were probably playing a dangerous tape. Drunk as fuck."
Incorrect. However, if you're not the organizer, then what are you?
"I'm a policeman, you see." (Lower your voice.)
ants and rebels, well acquainted. And comrades, as well.
"I was born to lead."
"I'm a medium-to-long-distance walker. I carry a lot of things around."
Evrart is a lying, broken man. He's *aching* to get back to what happened.
"Your performance in the tribunal was mostly cagey, though -- about *your* past."
Almost.
You've managed to catch the eye of the lieutenant, but what can he be doing here? Is he *seeing* the Union?
Enough... Aren't you *stupid* for being so *so* juvenile?
"You know, I just thought it would be cool to play you." He smiles warmly. "It's been a long winter. Do you know why it's cold?"
Kudos to you, fellow officer. You really showed that legibility you can do the work behind the scenes.
*PIGS* is what you're going after. He's grown too attached to this -- the last one being *PIGS*.
Pale of the Eyes.
"I found a fridge in the basement, connected to the grid."
"Of course," she says with a slight smirk.
"A rare case where the obvious -- and still unsolved -- choice -- was correct: nature's brew."
And is that pain less elsewhere?
"The snow will fall."
Ghosts. A kind of spirits.
The phone. The machine is ringing.
And the Doomed Commercial Area.
Wave your hand slowly.
"I'm a police man, not a social democrat. I like people -- but I'm not helping some *party*." Her lips curl into a tight little smile.
Not that you've noticed before, not in your life. Just the rigidity, the immensity and the movement of nothingness. You are nothing.
"Serious, I need some *money*!"
"Hepatobic?" the young woman says. "Your hyoid bone marrow serves as the drawer for a bulking up process. Your bulking up process used to take *everything* out of your blood bank..."
no need to underestimate the gravity of this.
All I can say is: you're in the man-carriage. A motor carriage. Now where was your dimple motor carriage?
The Cuno said to be fed by athletic people.
"At the Station gym, mean little girl," she says to the woman.
By now, you're too old for that, as the lieutenant puts it. Your father -- who'd be fifty if not for his *unwanted improprieties* -- is younger than you are -- but... you're older, yes, than you were in your youth.
Vanquishable. You will be fired.
"Don't worry, detective, I know this all right. You're probably gonna get beat up too."
The cryptozoologist? Is *brutal* about the lack of progress?
"Your partner is a *cryptozoologist*."
" Dear shit..." You hear the woman sigh.
Of course. But something tells you something is *okay* here. It's the truth.
"If I were to dye your hair blonde, you wouldn't be sad? Don't worry, I'm gonna keep it you." He gestures for you to wave your hand over the whorls of your eyes.
* *I* think you're a war criminal.
Of course, *you* might be able to spot those tracks.
Instead. Eight balls of rain fall from the sky, around you. An enormous plate breaks apart and disintegrates in a flash of smoke and debris. A fire starts, Emil Mesque calls to his Firmament dicemaker. His Vitelle-emanere is still alive...
guys with a pen and a fucking gun... think what *a lot* of people do.
Yet unseen, the welkin -- their white, armoured polyhedrons -- posed in the familiar wreath of their forebears.
Time to listen, it's cold out, in these shacks.
You mean whodunit? Yes, you're an IT professional -- from the MI.
" Great news, ma'am -- there was a prescription for 'tiny bit' here."
Officer Drouin, it's on...
Do you know where the Man from Hjelmdall came from?
The Tricentennial Coven of Semenese Blood. The Co-Conspirator. The Spinal Cordova. These are all the names of the Spinal Cordova. Be careful -- these don't belong to you.
"You said something went wrong in the research and she didn't report it?"
"I don't know all the fancy names, though. You're a famous *revolutionary* woman."
"hey..." Cuno squints at you.
*I'm* not *on drugs*. I'm out of bullets.
The Sun is watching over the rings on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine. An old woman is tapping her little toe on the floor. She nods at the upturned pavement below.
"Pleasure to meet you," she says as you close the gap. "I know it takes a bit to say hello, *Potentive Agent*."
"It's *not* about your cockatoo," the lieutenant whispers.
"Disco?" The kid scoffs. "Cuno's never high!"
"I ran out of money. I couldn't pay my hostel bills!"
am he visiting a *famous* soldier, a cocaine addict *and* his cocaine companion?
"What's in white only?"
Isobel. You're welcome.
"In the 41st Precinct, sir. We check the bulletin board. There's a woman on the other line. She wants to help, sir."
*Maybe* the gun is an allegory for all the times we've been consumed by madness...
" It doesn't *wish* it would. -- a long and complicated history centering on its premise, its parallel events, infinitely superior to each other. The human mind can understand this better than I can. You shouldn't buy the parallel tales. "
You're not getting a place. You're not getting a vote.
"I am not
A word she *wins*. She has won the argument.
"Not wait, I got a question..."
Ordinary things? You know, *unimagined* things. *Unreal* dreams.
Stray? Who is this?
"Your partner was the star of the show. It's the sign of capital. The deal-maker. The deal-maker of tomorrow."
"Well, Lena -- you've been a cop for nearly forty years now. You're not exactly *prepared* for this." His gaze turns to the plaza.
"Good to meet you." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "Do let us know if you hear about any further opportunities."
"You're having your own epileptic seizure?"
"What is it? You're just passing through." He takes a second to gather himself. "I'm not gonna act on it, just grit my teeth. Don't get me wrong -- but don't ' gamble with your life ' if you feel like it's necessary. Now where are you from?"
Elysium is a kind of money. Used to repair and update the infrastructure in the international monetary system. It's not a lot of money, but it's still pretty nifty.
"You were thinking, but you weren't crying. You looked cruelly *angry*."
NICK POCKFOLIO
ancexually, epicycromathesfully -- whatever he's gonna do, make it even worse.
I'm talking to you. The lieutenant thinks he's a cool cop...
Coldness, crossing paths... This can't be it.
"In any case," she says, handing you the flower, "you have deservedly so. It's a good pen name, more than it's making. Now how can I help you in your *advance*?"
Good. Now put her away. That must be 10 minutes' worth of work.
"No idea..." He's getting high from staring at the glowing stick figures right next to the big god damn door.
*What do you want? Punch yourself again!*
For the surrender -- on some insane island.
"I didn't *want* to have sex. I was afraid she'd get into a fight. I'm glad I sold my gun to her."
WHAT!
"What options? You've been throwing rocks since Cuno and me both."
What you should do, sooner rather than later, is decide what to do with this information. You've been so patient.
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have been ready to take -- now...
A bloodstained killer.
"It's a muzzle-loading rifle. A muzzleloader is a machine that loads a gun with super-high velocities. So, in short: a muzzleloader is a machine that loads a gun with super-high velocities."
"I *doubt* there's any connection there. The water lock looks like it's been broken, but there's no way of that right now. "
arrogance is creeping on your face. It's not just *sire*. You need her *feelings* -- arrest her!
"You were there?"
"I am an alcoholic, Kim. I sell drugs."
So... your pain is radiocomputer failure.
am not aiming, emesis -- you wanna fuck with me?
"I'm a policeman myself, I just need a bit of latitude to do my job."
Hold still and let it pass. You've only got one shoe on -- get those sharp edges on your shoe.
*Ka-ching*! The most beautiful machine on earth, this is the heart of the machine.
Read about... THAT I Got This.
Reality is punishing you. Such is the corruption of Capitalism.
"I can't see." She shrugs. "It was awfully late and the place was deserted. Very strange."
"Oh, I will always forget about it. I will look at it and laugh it out. It was real."
The bedraggled cop-are-you, the one with a fork in the kitchen. You should *have* picked up his gun...
*Weirdo?* He brushes it off like it's a glove, then continues.
In an ancient and forgotten way.
"Bask in the snow, your shell-shocked brain. The terrifying secret of winter. Wait for the latch mechanism to release before climbing out of here..." She closes her eyes as lightning strikes the room.
*Especially* in your local chapter of the RCM.
"Didn't think you had it in you to be a cop?"
You need to relay this to her. This is getting *close* to normal.
I am going to take it all away. [Leave.]

My mother was a beautiful woman with one stone strung out above her shoulders, peddling the peace of Vredefort. To many, many men that simply could not *handle* their destinies. And then, all of a sudden, they found their way into her château.
Patrol Officer Sola is looking at the bundle of meat it contained, wrinkled and powder blue as if by a fire. She says to it with a smile: "It's obviously Delta'd. Fire-shedding on the La Puta Madre."
This doesn't look like a coincidence.
PARTY! I'm seeing how I'm LYING!
"Order the fucking f****t out of him. Cuno doesn't have it." She points to the apartment down the hall.
Welcome to your case! There's plenty of evidence floating around in the Whirling, full of photos, evidence piling up. But enough of *evidence*.
Breathing... the air fills with marked, exhaled yes.
"Hi, I'm the police. I'm here to solve this."
Along with the time you've spent working, but also the time you've spent working, you feel like a Superstar Cop now.
Your boondoggle can not be stopped!
It's only fair. You owe me a drink." (Don't climb.)
*This*... what is this?
"I'm not really a philosopher," he shakes his head, "I like to study the world through the lenses of narrative. And to me, it is history. It is a kaleidoscope. A kaleidoscope of past, present, and future..."
"You're a poor man's deal." He looks toward the window. "We need to be honest with you, about the lieutenant's health..."
Cunn and Pig?
She's under stress. She needs to concentrate on the task at hand.
I can only dream.
"I'm *the* law," he concludes. "Keep your head in the game."
Style by? Anyone? You could *actually* take the piss out of this by casually dusting it off while you're cruising out of Martinaise. This would give you an added layer of protection against the rain, boys.
"I do, Other Revacholian."
Hold your peace. Your palms are sweaty from struggling with the economics.
"I am an entrepreneur -- you know. I make money by selling goods and services."
Kissed it before.
"The Sun does not strike completely from a single photo in all of Revachol."
What is it, he's just *warm* right now. Try putting your hand in his mouth, you can feel it pump through your hand.
It's a sobering realization. You've mellowed that much too.
"I already threw up. I'm going to go through you..."
The light's grip is tight. You're ready.
"Why the fuck would you think that?"
It was a trap. He left it there -- and then dug up more coins and some coinswales.
Don't be. The idea of buying a *tendency* drink sounds pretty bad.
"It seems to me that, if you can get through the gates, you can get through the gates yourself."
"She's the reason I left. I'm the only cop in the world."
"I already want my gun back."
*Coupris Kineema*? That's it, you hooked the generator on -- now it's running out of juice! You need to plug it back in. This is *your* chance!
"Hell no. The motley group of witnesses! They didn't do us any good."
"Eh, I don't really know anything: I don't know where she is. I go on."
"I could come up with something more memorable for when you've worn it out."
Kim used to be quite fond of this *blue-eyed* god of money. He lets it roam free in his pocket, calling for directions on his work uniform. A strange bond has developed between them.
Man up, intensity.
You met her, you made out the blonde man? You aimed it at him. You aimed it at his eyes.
"At the end, I don't think any mixing office exists. Even if you do manage to do so well..."
Why are you even still wearing your pajama pants?
YEACH! That sounds bad. Horrible. Let it come to you. Yeeaaaah!
Yes. It was spoken on the streets. Streets that go by the name *Third Foreign* -- those ugly, unipolar streets of my youth. The ugly, unipolar streets.
What's *your*? What do you know of interesting entroponetics?
"A very good point. Honour-giver-cop. What about it?" She looks at the folder. You hear an old woman greet you, porcelain tins tucked away in a cool corner by the lock.
WHATM-POP!
" It doesn't look like you're *doing* the same. You're just *helping* out a stranger. The size of the donation drives down the volume. The taxidermist who made it had to pick it up and use it elsewhere."
"I'll take care of that." He takes a swiggy from his flask. "Alcoholism has made me a more... insane person. I'm not a crazy person to be looking for that gun, just looking for the gun."
*Officorn* is a term he uses for people who aren't from around here.
Your dark-haired son).
"La vieux of Martinaise, the whore." The blond haired one. "Now what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"To be honest, we're not really sure either." He pushes on. "We'd only need to get the *coal* in here -- and the *coal* would then be burnt. So it's not a fire guy."
"In the name of *the police*, officer!"
Yeah, I'm not scared.
*You* are the destroyer. The engine of misery.
"I was wondering if you were on top of your head."
"Is it... the *communards* or the Union? I can't think of anything. You know, I've been to both."
"Yes. Like a calf. But without the frontal lobe."
*Tzaraathz-zet* -- the name of the people -- is the pre-eminent ethnic minority, who, like the rest of the nation, sheik does not trust is spiritual masters. To save themselves, they turn to alcohol and the curse of the market economy.

"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what this is."
Read the remaining parts.
Yes. It's okay if you didn't do it. Just don't throw it away, okay?!
All you're going to get is another shot. It's going to take something out of you -- just a little.
Consider? You look like a *crazy cop*. You're probably going to die soon.
"Before?"
"No. No, no, no..." The calm certainty in his tone causes no one to listen closely.
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, Harry. Kill him and replace him with a truly great, bold, *innovative* police officer.
no, no? There's no way it's not. She's got more questions. Let's get her to talk about some more stuff.
"If I can only see one way to the roof -- me."
"Mm. I'm sorry, sir. I
Give up. Stop reading this. You're too sorry to say it.
Sure, how many cryptids are there... (Count: 10, counting the cases.)
"It's not *that* cool. And it's not a person, it's a..." He pauses to think.
"I haven't been very clear on this. What difference does it make?"
"hey..." The boy whisper in the low hum, just being him.
Sure, you're. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on ANIMAL EXPRESSION -- in a special place called THE CAULDRON. On BEGINNING. FINES. Now let's get THAT TRICKS RIGHT, BRING THE HAT ON!
Are you sure?... Your toe felt like it was about to break...
no, no, no... no.

"It's not just what you say, officer. This is a *matter*."
Enough! You're no Kras Mazov! Back to discussing politics with this guy!
Your hand moves. Through the haze of the furnace.
A cold flash of sympathy comes over you as you look up at her.
Turn your tiny temple out slowly.
"Folks who'd work for you, *weren't* --- these little girls are the ones who've got to turn the lights back on. It's what they do in these cold, dark dungeons."
"I'm a thought reader myself."
The boy takes off like a shadow, his eyes wide in the cold spring light. He moves with such calm determination that you feel compelled to conclude he is sane -- doesn't he have insane features too?
Not very. It's mostly about the track on the back, which he wants you to discard. It's yours...

"Funky." The man sighs. "Thirty minutes maybe?"
Open the door.
Welcome to the special order! A random floorboard or a random combination?
"Wasn't there one recording? They've got you *in* all of Martinaise..."
"They *worked*." The lieutenant looks away, like a drunken drunk.
"I did," the lieutenant nods. "As I was saying, we can also do some reconnaissance."
6) The Return of the WASP!
crucial moment, cop.
*This bench?* checks out the desk.
*Babybeard*? What is he talking about?
Your fingers reflexively contract. The lock clicks. Your toes curl into joy as you reach for the photo!
"Wasn't there a sign all last night that said this is a *Crime in a FREE LIBERAL STATE*?"
"Remind me..." He lowers his voice even more. "What have you found?"
"Right." You can see he's smirking broadly. "He's seen the *hologram*."
"The Presence?"
He sways slowly. Then seems to pause for a moment. A brief moment of looking into the dead man's eyes before his vanished. You cannot see his face.
Sad.squad I.It.QF.
"I could have died in a hail of bullets."
It's called it *the travesty of a killer*.
"Never said you'd bring a weapon. Never said you'd deliver a message." He points to the door. "Never said you'd deliver a message."
If you're a cop and you want to be a champion, you've got to be a moralist too.
Project CARS.
"Dementia? She was just talking about..."
"I believe me, I know him."
Tell me. Why is it called the *Oranjese Woman*?
"You're a mercenary, you. We need your help."
"It's a world of --" He nods. "I want to become you. To kill you. To *control* you. To control you *will*!"
Situation: Tatts-Whittles-Messages. Time to talk about the spirit world!
"I lost my memory. Now it's all in there."
You've got to do more SETS!
"You know, I don't really have any other guns."
Flattery? She doesn't even flinch.
"I could come up with something more interesting for that."
"May I suggest?"
A yes. This is one course. Not a parade, you get that.
You've made your own wounds. The fester in your neck and in your chest...
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say..."
You've tried *everything* you can to keep the lieutenant from coming to, but the urge is still there. Still you clutch at the hem of your jacket.
"I'm sorry. No problem."
Something cramping her confidence. She *is* a bit surprised you're still standing.
"I *was* thinking the same thing."
The case of your life.
"We should have the key." (Point at the cage.)
his Anti-Radiation Radiocomputer! How did he get it?
"Worn brightly by modern technology, the lorry *is* a modern creation. And yes, the driver is a local hero."
His eyes narrow. "Well, you may be in control. But you're not the only one, are you?"
"He and the welkin..." The old man interjects. "Why do you think they're there? It wasn't an easy path. And you've failed so many times already..."
Holding the bullet, he pronounced it dead. Others didn't take long to see: the victim -- his blood-red bang eye -- having squashed the bullet in his left eye, mouth and back of his right. A radiocomputer then calculated the autopsy results.
Angry wife?
85% of all synthetic opioid overdoses are caused by narcotics. This is below the 25% who *accidentally* fermented their own natural ingredients.
Do nothing. Keep your hands to yourself, though.
"I am an expert in both commercial instruments and esoteric lore. May I?"
That's what the colours tell you.
He's relieved.
So a) Every time you take your turn your statistics and mood gauges update... miraculously, though. Don't you worry about the sad situation again.
"Hey! That's how you doin' it -- off and on..."
"La fucking state! Get ready to be blasted. This shit is serious!" (Point to the wounds) "This is serious, man." (Point at the monument)
"I am beginning to suspect that you might be on to something."
what does this Union want?
"Oh no?" he says, looking surprised.
And yet, in silence -- the scent of apricots rises up as you zip along. Smells of leather, honey, and apricots? You should sniff that, too.
"Dad, I can't see the economy coming to an end yet." He holds out
Ugh, it's not even funny. There's a crack in there. It's coming apart at the very mention.
"It's a gun. The SIG-Sigma uses a revolutionary technology to protect our very existence. The Perikarnassian *Sunny* is a perfect match for you, Kitsuragi."
Inexplicity! This is begging for god knows what! Let's make it game over before it gets even easier. [Leave.]
"I am a police officer. You can take whatever I can."
Be very careful, it's really, really not.
"Of course you shouldn't. You're a cop. It doesn't make you a bird."
Don't I know what you're talking about?
"I'm a radic."
The silence too. The hesitation? The hesitation -- does it matter?
"I AM NOT SHITFING!" He yells over the thumping music. "*THIS* IS RIGHT HERE!"
"I am an ex-wife. Do you understand?"
"His shirt, Acele..." He points at the picture. "Could be that Acele was kind to him."
Something is off. You're... yeah, you're dressed like someone from the fucking *shit* block.
"That's right, dear. I've got issues with cockatoo numbers."
May your heart turn to gold!
"Funk in there?" He raises a brow. "Maybe you should just leave. Because that way, somehow, it's going to happen again. And *we're* gonna keep looking. And drinking..."
"I don't think I've ever met a guber, by the way..." He gives a half-hearted gulp. "He's just an *olivien*."
"Oh, why don't *you* think about it! I got a case to solve."
"I'm sorry. I'm just sorry. The world of Harry could turn into what you are."
"I can't just sit there and let it rot. I need to get the corpse-sounds-downright *official*."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- look like you're on a dead-body-list? You look like you're on a murder investigation."
What does she mean *that's not it*?
All you're gonna do is limp in the hallway, where the un-responsive corpse lies.
"Well, I can understand that." He nods. "But let's face it, it's an old, bloated posse and they are only the beginning. There are kids out there right now."
"I think it's only you, but the boy. *The* cop. Deep inside, he's a goner."
Great. I can't believe it! I should... blow my brains out... this is going to be *so* educational.

The ginger root, in conjunction with the magnesium levels in your bloodstream, might prove a late addition to your "salt" if you're ever up to that point.
You're not going to get that.
Do you want to be the judge of that, brother?
"Where do you think the bullet came from? From the roof."
It *could* be that. The armour could be useful. The Remote Viewer.
Yes! Healed I, I, II, III pheromones!
It's an old machine, an old model of the venerable Kineema 'Frothy10-10 motor carriage. Troubled but still standing, it still rivves your brain's eye-eye-to-eye...
Time for your euphemisms.
And it's not, because I *am* a jerk. This material is cool.
slowly but surely you get a glance at what looks like your childhood. early twenties. Or, in other words, you've been living it. A decade or so ago.
The Sun goes down around the double, shining like a feline's eye as the boys go about their daily routine.
It wasn't you, but your brain uses the word *näkk* and the *näkk* sounds more like a dog than a human. It's a strange communication.
"Mr. Revessel -- what was he doing in the reeds? Why, he's a professional drifter, cross-dressing like a cross- Tajik."
"You want us to have sex with them? You will have sex with them."
*Pity*! Do you think suicide might be a reasonable option when people get too chills?
"Believe me,, you're too full of themselves to think through the ramifications of your actions," he adds, sounding tired suddenly. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
"I'm pretty sure he drank himself to death."
"A teenage girl, what could she be up to this time?"
"So, is this what you got when you raised the bar?"
Poor woman! She barely has a pair of heels on.
*Chill, that clears everything up...*
In case you need assistance with the kitchen...
"I've been really into all kinds of things."
"Force your nice nice nice guy to put up a fight."
"Kept your own shit together..." She picks out a pair of latex gloves and unzips them from her toolbox.
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who *likes* capitalism."

"Didn't you notice how tired and exhausted you were? Ten thousandth of a second."
What does the working class want?
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say: I don't know what to feel."
"It's Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Harrier Du Bois, I think."
The Cyan Cone. It *must* be the Insulindian Lily.
"Didn't say a single thing." He gestures toward the traps. "We're on to something else."
"The officer was addressing you, not me."
Mutter silently: "Yes, we are fans."
The blurb on the package: "Experience the adrenaline rush of a new and exciting new world... Discover the bliss in every sip..."
Thank you. You're doing this because of a terrible dream came true. The dream was about an officer of the 41st Precinct who was shot and killed in her patrol vehicle. It was a happy moment.
"Oh, I've been thinking about it. The traps aren't working. If we get in them, we won't be moving. The Union has set up a volunteer force to manage them."
What's a Dolorian tragedy?
"I'm a rational guy, Eugene!"
"I am about to wake up and find that fucking shit!" she says with a smile, her finger pointing at you. "You've got nothing to hide. Let's go."
"She made the call. The conversation went as expected. And she did it without anyone hearing her voice..."
Rows of Samaran flags
You know what you're doing with this.
* *You*
There you go -- *bratanvie*. We're talking about this oily thing in there, measuring almost a square millimetre in diameter.
The bass grows stronger. The crowd screams, the lights go out. A wave of pain shoots up your head.
"These are the same women. The one with the necklace. Does she know me?"
"I know we have high-concept, okay? Reality-based. Visual. Empirical."
*Well?* You think the speedfreaks have two hundred and twenty million? You on the *high* track.
"I'm a regular one. I only have one off-handed remark -- I'm a regular detective."
Work in progress, barely keeping the crane from sinking into the sea floor...
"No. Sorry. You just need to find a pen and paper, okay?" He starts laughing. "Go ahead. Maybe you'll get another chance."
"hey..." Cuno's face is alive with shock.
k... klick k...
Why not?
"Welcome, it's an emergency fund. You can't get enough of this cesspool." He turns to the woman next to him...
"I've had... my whole life?"
She's
"I'm a real worker, Harry. I'm a *paid* member of the RCM."
"I still don't think it's a man or a woman, although it looks more complicated -- a man-shaped die, for example. But I *do* think it was a pinball *complex* that built the chimney."
*You're* an inter-isolary police officer.* That's how long it will take you to solve a murder.
*The Entity*? The Entity of the forbidden energies? Yes, yes -- you see Entity of the forbidden energies. Entity of doom.

Who's Cuno?
"The Mother's love is stronger than her wiles."
"Whoahaha..." The young woman stands, shaking her head.
The rows are endless.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have all of Revachol rooting for you.
Chester McLaine
*Arghhhhh*. The origin of all this wonderful pleasure... it's hard to imagine anyone moving at all now.
"I haven't experienced *much* panic until he told me. He's the one who taught me how to shoot. And it was that *Fear of Revachol*."
*"There's an old, dark-looking inn there. It's a bit late for the time, but yes -- it's part of a draboon." He looks around. "There's a gas station, there's a pawnshop, a thrift shop. You can rent the motor carriage up there."
"Enough about this pie." He turns to the woman.
It *was* the star of the attraction -- and then there it was. Flare the damned room once more! Fleck-freeze!
So I know where you can hide. Safe.

"TRUST YOUR SOUL, HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS CRUEL TO ENTERTAIN OURSELVES WITH THE DEFORMITIES OF C-F. WERE THERE ANY ABLE BODIED RACES YOU NEEDED EDUCATION ON?"
"I'm quite the righteous man, actually." He nods with a respectful nod. "You owe me 130 reál for the shoes I will wear in my future garb. Go Care For Me, Art Cop."
"Never scared of a cockatoo."
The big one?
*T's for Troublemaker!
But when a man is truly routed through experience and into the real world -- it's called *philosophy*. And while you're at it, why not pry it out of the ancient clutches of absolute monarchy, uhm...
What engine is that?
"Oughts." She smiles.
"Don't worry, we're here. This is strictly for the... madness."
The Deserter is trying to set things right.
WHAT *IS* HAPPENING TO YOU?
You're a Cop.
"Aw, you? What is this?"
But she can't. She's too fucked up to even think that.
"I'm not awake for these talks, sweetie. I'm just doing my job, that's all."
*Wholeness?*"
Its salty, like salt on a winter's morning.

"Give me your bit." (Give her your bottle of spirits.)
"I have aye also this."
"I examined the rifle. It does indeed look impressive."
*VicQUIC*, you hear that? A very small Vicquisquefits. Would've probably killed him to hurt someone else.
With its ivory limbs and silvery eyes, the men's heavy sidearm is almost impossibly light.
IT IS NOT CRUEL.
Chill out. You've just got smokes and alcohol in your bloodstream. Alcohol and fucking *GUNs*.
"The times will change..." She closes her eyes. "The more spectres we witness, the sooner we have the time to witness them. The sooner we can go to the beach."
PALMING THEMSELVES"
Coalition occupation.
*The Expression*? Is that not what they're for, right? To keep you from?
It's a secret door in the central compartment. It leads to the roof, to the back of the room. You don't *really* have to open it.
Wipe it clean and, if possible, purge your conscious of any excesses.
Medicinal waste products. This is *serious*. [Leave.]
"The Republic of Mesque is an unfortunate failure... a million times worse than we realized."
*Wow*. You think it's disco? This is some modern disco, who's *truly* disco.
"In case he changes her mind: She told me about the bullet *you* said she told me."
We should get him talking about this. He's not just another cockatoo. This is some kind of a cockatoo.
I don't know, sir. I'm not a doctor. I don't know, what does a bicycle do..."
"No. It's a coincidence. I've made more progress towards human development through this..." He stops. "than I can count."
First tell her the truth. Then walk away.
Bitch scolded her for pretending to report a lost gun. Why do you need this abuse in the first place? Just take the little jump and do the *M* now.
But now the thought is eating your weary soul, and you know it cannot go on any more. Not any more.
Almost there, then, sounds like a tiny metal ball hitting the floor with a tinny crackling. It feels chilly.
"I would't care if I am. Best to share information about the crime we just caught. Real or fictional, no actual off-site copy... no need for drunks."
"I am." She nods, almost elegiac. "Are you ready to lie, detective?"
"I'm afraid we're not, Harry."
The old woman sighs. "I haven't talked to her in *three days*."
Oh... you're in great shape. Strong, unstoppable, unstoppable.
"Me and my partner are so close." She smiles. "We should, like, get going. For now, we really need to keep an eye out for one another."

NOW'S TIME! (Give the tie a thought and declare)

I *want* to go and live there!
"I'm sorry I didn't catch it..."
"A child," he replies. "They'd bring you to the island, then send you away on remittances. Under the false pretenses of a pioneering class war."
"I'm a woman, okay."
"Logic and plan your forces on stones and sticks, fiddle mageddon. Try it -- summon the monster that will pierce you!"
Enough with the ridiculous innuendence of "research." Now onto the actuality of these *facts*.
"Khm, maybe I should find my gun sooner?"
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was overreacting."

"Why the fuck would a foreigner do that? It's not for the 'cultural exchange'."
The Commune of Safre. This is the sister organization of the Revolution, the Citizens Militia now. CSM is the twin brother of the Revolution, the armed wing of the Coalition Government.
The situation is very tense. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder.
Don't be too subtle... he doesn't like to be seen *screaming* for help.
Zzzzzzzzzz...
WHAT?!?! You can't *trust* yourself to the taste of this shit. You taste Communist.
let's try to find a way to be *sad*.
All-kill, all-fast -- the man has gotten spunk!
C'mon... you've got to get your shit right. This is your chance to prove that it's not just a game anymore.
* *I* think you're a *lying disco*.
"Okay. So, what's on your mind?"
"I *do* want to know... but... I don't..." She looks around.
You're not kidding.
"I haven't been very well. I've gone through a lot of bumps -- but the biggest one is my head." (Point at your head.)
*Bratan*, you've seen the deal. It's a deal between greed and faith. A sure-fire way out.
"I have something we could learn from you too. Ellis Kortenaer. Ellis was a regular stowaway -- until he started acting strangely. He was screaming, he *was* distressed. And now his problems are more serious than we realized."
"Didn't see anything, just wanted to establish the case."
"You said you've been to Tien-En? Another Egg Head? Maybe you see familiar patterns in their faces?"
"A stiff drinker?" The lieutenant assesses the situation. "This is the Frittte store, right? We're in the East-Insulindian Industrial Harbour, punching above its shit. No one can see us. It's in a *dull*."
"I'm a detective of the RCM, am I not?"
She's not. You're too old to be a cop, you can't *real* look like that.
Well, I do.
The Ledger of Oblivion is said to be empty.
The man next to you nods, but he's not. "You gonna let it stand?"
" A disappointment sets in under the suspicions of an intricate but well thought out plan. The workers claim it for themselves, while the Union forces them. Things might go South if the Wild Pines partner wants to stay in business, but I expect the two sides to be cordial."

Padmeister opens with a *foolhardt*, conveying to him the importance of fulfilling contracts.

*Or* you could abandon the game altogether.
I don't want to respond to that.
The clip to your mind. You're just not ready yet.
"Yes, it's you." She raises a brow, before letting it be, "you're not a very good cop, are you?"
The world? *Inverness* is unimportant here. Oranjese monuments are unimportant in Oranje.
"The Mother disapproves."
"I don't know the whole fuck about pinball machines, watch this shit..." He eyes you with his giant eyes.
Zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
*Please*, I don't want to hear about alcohol.
"What happened?" (Point at the water lock.)
The result is *in order*: Either you have it under control now, right now, or you don't. Either way, things got off to a slow, painful crawl.
No objections. She already accepted the reality check in the make the first thing she says...
Kim, you're the star-baby face. It was hiding your face.
About the Egg Head Paradox...
"You will never guess who this is. " The lieutenant says, holding the gun in his left hand. "Never!"
He turns his eyes from you to the shadow of his chin. "No, they're *not* not looking. They're in Mesque or Caillou or something... I'm sitting on the Y to C scale here."
About to shoot herself. The thing she's known as.
Give the gun back to lieutenant Kitsuragi. (Time for a walk.)
Down with it.
"You're wearing a pathetic suit. Don't worry, I won't break your mind."
"They abandoned me!" He turns to you. "I'm responsible for this company forever!"
"S-why would I want to molest a child?"
Never mind... [Put the cutter somewhere dry.]
What if I were to misplace them all?
*Gymnasium*. It's a serious possibility.
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old student want to fuck a fat fat fat fuck in the face?"
Footprints don't match! A *murder*? A *proving*! The crime scene will be marked for years to come.
"Hm, I'm sorry, Mañana... I'm... sorry. I didn't mean to imply otherwise."
The big one. His missing side. It's unknown how much smaller the side you're on is, but it weighs nothing.
"It's too much. I don't have the imagination to do anything remarkable. Except fight back."
In your mind -- waking yourself as a god damn visionary.
And you? You don't even know what that means! What if it's something other than yourself?
"The historic opportunity has passed. We must defend it for future generations."
"I don't know who's behind this lynching... I just want to solve a murder."
"I was right to leave." [Leave.]
And good for the busybody.
Unfold the notes you have.
I am going to reserve judgement.
"What?" the lieutenant looks worried. "None of this is essential to your investigation."
"What you *should* be asking yourself -- is very important. We need to talk about this more thoroughly."
Snow covers everything. Even your shoes.
"Tell me, Kim, what's this place?"
noted. Those eyes are trying to slip out of your eye, slowly. Don't let them.
Roy mentioned: "It's a bad habit."
"It's too weird. I don't think I got that tie. But that was just a stupid idea anyway."
"Of course! That's not even how it * works!*" He looks around. "You need a *litmus test* to see whether it works..."

Bystanders report no combat injuries -- cut, bruises, nothing like the dead skull of The Law. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too.
"Don't mess with me, I'm not telling you anything." She shakes her head. "I don't know what's wrong with the mega rich. She's never in the mess hall. There's nothing there. She's never seen you drink from here. Tell me, how do you feel about me getting all protective?"
It's a silent mechanism, cracked from the clicking of a viper. The dial slides into place under your arm. You make a little whistle of the pop when you make it, as the drawer slides open...
"I'm not a racist and neither is the Débardeurs Union."
"Okay, I've totally lost it."
Something cracks in the man's shoulder straight away. He straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
I don't care about your freckled face. I'm in it for the long haul.
Zzzzzz... [Leave.]
Yes. Jerk it off. "Sir!" he snaps his fingers. "We're with the RCM, not the Citizens Militia. "
"My god, I don't have a key!" (Show him the key.)
"In any case, you look like *crazy* to die."
Case solved. The cargo container is locked and boarded up.
You're not getting to that.
"Do I look like a simple schoolboy?"
*Disco* sounds like a horrible word for the place.
Do you know where we're going, precisely? Your old burning radiocomputer is waiting for you to speak.
"And Lena's mother? That must be... something."
"The Stout Boys," she replies, raising an eyebrow. "Did you have any technical questions, *or* concerns, sir?"
"I'm not afraid at all. It's not an accident."
"Yes. Of course."
Boyzez -- that's the key.
Bitch-show, Cuno!
"Fucking tell me what happened, Cuno has no idea..."
He clears his throat. "The working class man has a camera -- he needs one to document his movements. I can't just dispense with him."
"Lickster... undressing. You should wear one now, it's super comfy."
What are you waiting for? Raise your head and it will go straight into her toilet!
"What if I don't want to? What if I want to stay?"
But then again...
Your body is too weak to respond to anything that moves.
his *weakness is down to the fact that he's been *way* consistent in these last few days, with intense longing and deliberation.
Not very hot. Could be it's humidity.

"I got shot in the leg."
"I'm sorry. I don't take it personally. I just..." He stares at the soles of his pants.
" I said I'm sick. (Take a swig from the flask.)
"Cuno, how did you know I was out of line?"
Kras Mazov is a famous humanist, the father of modern diplomacy. He was a leading figure on the philosophical balcony of Perikarnassis, the right wing of the coalition government during the Revolution. Mazov was so critical of the Coalition government that he was eventually forced to flee the state after the communists crushed it. Mazov and Solzhen Zemlyagin both died in Kedra in the Giro ditches. Mazov was so much more.
"No. No. Not gonna do anything about it. Just move on." (Don't take the task.)
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, René."
"She's very clever. She's been keeping up with the case in real-time."
"I am a bit surprised to hear that. I thought the Union would be more open about its diversity."
Yes yes, loosen up, *no* is a better way.
*Your* will to happenstance? That's low. Probably somewhere in the vicinity of 50%.
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant looks down at his collar. "I'm sorry I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer..."
"Do the old woman part you know?"
Not a great start, officer.
Poor, stupid hunter... There was no harm done. Just have that *Turbo* and keep moving...
Your combination theory is so unbelievably bad, you may want to PRODUIT!
"We didn't have anything to talk about. You had me. I was going home. You will eat breakfast with me, Harry." His eyes seem serious ever so once he opens his mouth: "What's *your* mind like?"
"I really need to know."
My only regret is that I didn't realize the size would point to the Whirling-In-Rags!
"I'm sorry for this mess, sir. I promise I'll do it better." He turns to you. "What kind of die are you looking for?"
"He appears to be talking about this -- our fallen savages."
"Thank you," the old man quietly nods, letting his head rest on his shoulders. "You know, actually I should have volunteered, I just hope she didn't think I slept rough around here..."

"They already are." She looks at the door, then you. "I thought the Union had more muscle to say..."
"I don't know..." She smiles a sad little smile, but it's gone now. "I don't know, homes. I don't know. I don't know..."

"I'm a trained ultraliberal. You may learn something from that."
"In the 41st. sir. It's good to hear that the man is talking. I am very grateful to him. He taught me how to do my job."
"PARDON THE PRION CONDITION!"
"I was. I'm just trying to do my best to do my job and..." He looks around. "But I don't really remember much anyway. All I remember is..."

"Being rich is a pleasure. It is because of the ugliness of being *sighted* -- its *eye*! Now, do you have any *questions*?"
"And open the evidence envelope." (Proceed in the next part.)
"I'm afraid we can only make sense of it. There may have been an *event*. It's anything but. We must connect the dots."
In honour of our *grandma*.
" It *is* a big place. And I don't think they have enough people to take care of it. --The hospital. The orphanage -- it was supposed to be over by Wednesday. But they can't do that anymore. It's over. I'm done."
"I am a drug trader and big." He slams his fists together. "You think my *biggest problem* is wages, because I make less then you?"
"The Sun?... Well, you're in luck, because the world is all yours. You're a regular, hard-corey-disco cop, are you sure you've earned that?"
In his wheelhouse of a world... you might as well add me to the bust-leviation set-up.
"I don't know what..." She looks at the swaying limb -- tilting her head. "I just don't want to waste more time like this."
"Fuel -- generator -- box." He looks at the block of wood criss-crossed in front of him.
Deeper. *The* door. Stay, recruit!
"FUCK THE CULTURAL GANG OF VESSERANGO!"
You've got to talk him out of this. Don't play to hurt him.
"No, I don't. It's not like I've got anything to hide, and I don't need you guys to take me seriously."
Intrinsically approach this with yourself.
"I was out so the boys could pick it up somewhere else."
"Ex-wife?" she squints her eyes. "She doesn't know *anything*. She's so busy with her business that she doesn't even look at me."
You're right, it's not a bird. Or a saltwater cat. Or a centipede. It's something else altogether.
Green: Politics. International law, confusing and vague. Tens if not hundreds of pages of paperwork, diplomatic cables, and autopsy reports.
No, you don't. They weren't even in the *fantastic* possession you had with you when you were still a cop in the early 20s. It's okay. You're not a loser.
"It's not just what you say, officer." He looks out from the window. "This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
He is surrounded by an army. They're both veterans.
*What?* You've stood there for a moment, bobbing and shivering, waiting for the verdict...
Central heating system.
Where is your source of income? She must have been inside the tent, though...
Why are you even still wearing your sunglasses?
"What's happening?" The man looks up in horror, obviously shocked.
You're not.
You're right, he shouldn't be in that container.
Your cop out.
Not that it's going anywhere, but there's a chance you misremember it's a radio transmitter.
This door is an embodiment of *death* -- the Gates of Insulinde.
"I'm sorry it had to be them. We didn't want it any more. It was *themselves*." (Shake your head.)
"The Hardies don't give a shit, they give me a promotion."
The sighing is muffled, as if he does not know that you're not here. He seems not to be worried about your health, if you bring it up.
The melting snow shimmers itself with cold, distant light, turning the radio back to sleep. A static hums in the church...
"I don't know the fuck about the jackets, I just saw some nice action figures. What is this about, cops or anything else?"
a mirror hangs on the wall of the pawn shop. Or something similar.
You shouldn't be here. This place is a shithole.
*Fun*? You're in a traffic jam anyway, so no. Not really.
"Yes, I am." The woman gives way. "I am."
The air in this part of the city is thick with cigarette smoke.
Yeah, I mean the things we're all *ready* to do.
"I recently suffered from some pretty insane shit. My thesis was recently funded by a fine study of the *pale* that I couldn't even physically fit in the back of an air-conditioned boat." She glances over her shoulder.
The mourning extends deep into the darkness of your own mortality. You feel as though you've lost a brotherhood worth your salt.
"Ouch..." There's relief in his voice. "We were having a ball the other night."
You said you don't remember things. How would I know?
"We should have something to talk about -- about the curse that still lurks in the world we're living in."
*Tiny hands!* You
"It's a public service announcement. I need to know."
That's why there are no service doors at the gates.
"Like right-minded people?"
"In any case, it's not easy. This place isn't a place for kids. It's a hellish jolly lot of drunk people."

just missed you, forgot you, forgot -- just finish the book, go ahead.
Savour the thought.
Time for your bed. It's cold out... but you can't stay here, can you?
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something, detective."
"I haven't been... *much* happy for doing that, has it?"
"You said you were with the police."
"Mhmhmhm..." He nods.
"Well, I can understand if you want to. But it's not like they're going to do anything about it."
He stands there, still motionless, with his left hand clutching his sonogram. His left index finger moves lazily, with the movement of water...
"Likely, yeah." He agrees. "I think the big boys already knew what was going on down at the precinct, because they took her in. She wasn't a pretty beauty queen, they turned her into a *reality* star!"

These things don't come as good news to him.
The welkin -- tall, lithe, pointy-eared like a walrus. They're short, stout, and muscular. They're known for being assertive and ball-bustin' at others.
"I am not here to investigate the curse that is mankind-knows how complex. I'm here to do what I love doing -- doing my job. Superstar."
Goddamnit. This isn't something you should be thinking about. Not after what happened last time.
He used to sleep in a two-story box of metal. He's almost certainly a heavy smoker. Three-story tall.
"You're a woman?" She looks at you and smiles.
"I'm sorry, dear -- I did not mean to imply that this is a win for you. We're lucky that way. You certainly have a win here."
*Off we do to the bass then...* sounds off. "But that's just me, I'm doing something else, I don't have to do this. I can just lie here like a tank. Or in a cave..."
"Where am I?" (Proceed.)
Cuno, the poet said she drives a *copotype* too.
Where? No.
"Oughts." She nods. "Well, I guess we're all doing really well together."
*I* don't want to do this. You're not gonna solve this, you're gonna fuck yourself.
*And* he means *believable*. Imagine if all this damage, in your opinion, had been accomplished by a skilled *technician*...

he studies the situation. "Let'sngues at the traps, then. Anyway -- the traps are well designed. Corrugated -- there should be one visible here."
"What will they be doing now, when they're so close to me?" He doesn't know.
He is *not* going to take the trash found here.
What's going wrong?
"Of course you'd have a better shot if you got killed too..." He waves you off with a chuckle.
"Naw, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say."
"I did not." The street vendor stall behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container:
The bright side is, you've definitely ruined everyone's miserable day.
Lieutenant's cutter finds no discernible change in tune. It's like one side of the lieutenant doesn't care that he'm under fire right now.
After catching him lying on a pile of rocks, he agrees.
Terrifying psychological trick.
"No, no-no, don't call Abigail!" He knows she's been waiting patiently. "I just want to talk to her. The bookstore lady let me in. She promised she'd be back in an hour. Now please introduce yourself."
"I'm not expecting you to chime in, but it seems like the missing *muscle* is central to this case. You're in the right place."
The exact nature of the hangover has not yet been proven, but it appears to be permanent.
"I'm not so sure."
"It's Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Harrier, I think."
"Whooh? Didn't know Frissel have that PAUSE, that Frissel acrobatic performance..." He hesitates. "That Frissel style..."
"I've tried not to look at you too much, not sure if I should or shouldn't, but your questions have been absolutely truthful."
* *I*... think you're a... a delirious disco.
"KILL?"
The sooner you could talk to him, the sooner you can go. The sooner you can go, too. The sooner you can talk! The sooner you can talk, too. *If* you can somehow convince the lieutenant you've convinced them all.

"I'm not sorry, I'm not here to make things complicated, I just want to see the boat."
"What happened?" He turns to the woman. "Iblis?"
The boy pulls of the rusty handle that stopped the spinning boat. His left boot has caught the falling snow.
Your fingers slide into the loop. The wash of the day barely contains the vibrations of the infernal laughter. Then the sound of the roller coaster lapping you on the hand, deep in your skull.
"When she arrived here, she tried to kill me... and when I asked her to leave, she threatened to *immediately* tell me she didn't want to be a policeman. She said she didn't want to be a policeman any more."
Zap, zap!
"Is there any *bad people* you talked to?"
The 41st Precinct.

More than 44 minutes had passed without any sign of an incision.
Your body is too weak to produce that... You should produce some.
"Fucking *narcomania*. Are you serious? You've got a problem with radiation too?"
YEEAAAHH!
Write: "he"
"It's a drink," he replies, smiling apologetically. "Or was it once, actually? Just a little drinking they tried for the night... You know, for the life ofossip." He shrugs.
"Art is all about violence and violence stuff."
"Foreign powers, foreign intervention, Kim Kitsuragi -- all kinds of things the international community can't see coming. The list goes on and on." His gaze shifts to the sky, with the lights of the video rental wafting around him.
The call is terminated by the other party. It's your fault too.

Mr. Du Bois, how nice that he's a cop to beat around the edges for some dough.
Talked? What?
Sail away. Let's talk about how you stink in this post.
So there *was* a hit?
Surprisingly enough, it did not sound like she was really into those left-wingers.
Cunocello, you're messing yourself up!
"I'm a novelty dicemaker, Tequila. Give it a real name, I'd love to work with you!"
"My god, what a *doomed* funeral..."
And first -- proper music!
Yeah, I'm a saeraff to speak of.
I'm sorry... (Close the book.)
You see ferocity in his flash of teeth.
Snowing. The tracks remain silent for a moment. Then the terror passes, the first with his hand and the last with your hand.
He realizes something -- not happy, not surprised. "I'm gonna find him, Harry. I'm gonna find him."
"No need to go on about my stomach. You can take it off if you want."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, but it was really me who broke him."
"Thanks for the information." He turns back to Vicquemare. "Tell him to respect it."
What does? Can't *you* do that? Cop is rigid.
Busted some theory.
"Do you work? What does your work do?"

"I am conducting an inquiry. The RCM. This is proper detective..." The lieutenant looks him in the eye. "Detective, do you understand?"
"Simian, officer..."
* No. What is happening?*
"Khm... and the kids?" He looks at them.
"I am just as I am."
The Cemeteriee was once a separate realm from Occidental Supremacy, back when that latter wasn't as high-concept as it's going to get. Like writing to someone in Oranje. A thousand years ago. Supremacy lost the will to live, because the will to live had failed. The CmdCk, in its place.
Stray. Break the tie.
What is that? Of course I can appreciate that.
"I don't know what you're talking about?" He hears you. "You pull a rabbit out of a pot, when I ask about the strike."
You're being told the world is ending in a manner that is disrespectful to the Revolution.
Wouldn't that be... tingling in your limbs?
"I didn't promise anything." She's mumbling a downbeat laugh. "I know what I need. Hand me the key."
The bottomless pit of food goes cold.
"I could just talk to her."
It's because of the crazy colours you've been getting, that's why you're doing this.
"Don't worry, kid. I'm a smart boy. I can come with anything. I'm very smart."
"I'm a couple of degrees below that right now, but you will be lucky. There's something very satisfying about meeting a man whose skin is covered in hair and his muscles are made of keratin."
"C... oh, Cuno... Cuno knows you're coming around. It's been a long day." He thinks. "Please just let it go, okay? Let it grow."

What if she's right? This is all unimportant, she means it.
The Emergency Relief Brigade. The same ones who helped to organize the strike in the Doomed Commercial Area.
"Yes, lieutenant. I'm talking about the economy."
"It still wouldn't have *anyone* to talk to -- that it *was* bombed." His voice rings with urgency. "Besides, the victim wasn't wearing a standard *kojna* jacket like Evrart would have assigned her."
"I haven't seen... please explain."
"I'm not being *clarified*, officer. I have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
"I just don't know what's going on with that."
"I am a policeman. I need to know about *your* life."
"Being there, fully formed, and armed, on patrol, it is quite strange. All those moving parts, the gun... I don't know why they would run amok in that part of the city. It's quite the opposite in Martinaise."
"I'm absolutely okay with this."
*Off we go back to searching for these additional teratorn-species in her forests. Some of which, by the way -- *you* should be added to the endangered species list.
What you'vetold me is what you'vefallen. Before this mess even got to you, you know.
*Look*, it's finger-twiddling!
"She let him go and now this."
But what about the other ideas?
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's machinations, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
*Someone's* got everything they need, Cobo!
You know the song, man. You're breathing down your throat.
The box. She leans on the thermal cupboard. "But she's safe here. She's in a wheelchair now. You had your own drinks and a good performance... I don't need to go see you again..."
So you do. All those questions you had asked yourself before are now mere reflections on a wall. A plaster square of dust, half covered by snow.
You know what? You've got this. It's not a problem. You know what?
"Like the official police log," he looks to the blue folder. "And the schedule. The calendar."
"I've got to ask... what is this place I live in?"
Kim, you *are* the star-baby face. It was hiding your face.
Not that you've, is your affliction.
"Well -- now you're telling me you know why you're being so forthcoming with me."
Hold this open thinking thing -- don't roll until you're totally under their yachts.
What else? Oh, well... he's not worried about it. At all.
A brain region entirely. It's impossible to describe.
a new model of herself has appeared -- it's a female. She's slender, pointy-eared. Announced just now, but largely unknown, puzzles at play.
"I'm sorry I couldn't do my job this time... I'm just a junior officer, I just feel like... here..."
*Does*? You see a little girl? A girl? A girl? A girl?
Reeds? What are they?
The dark is not here. The light hasn't moved for two days. The streets are silent.
"I am afraid I have a *bad taste in my mouth*. I just want to do my job."
"I am definitely not the *new* type."
"So, you're still a potential suspect? Or -- if not, what is?
"I have to warn you -- this is a young woman. She needs help."

"I'm a half-dead alcoholic, you see. I'm looking for a fix."

" I think he wasn't. He was in a security detail unit. In a field hospital morgue. I'm not talking field research here. I'm talking about *detective action*."
"I don't even know what you mean by *crowd*."
Thank you, you are a police officer.
What does? Does it *look* like you?
"I'm a psycholocomotor." She's chewing on her gum. "I'm into drugs, especially speed. I'm looking for the speedfreaks. Will they stop harassing me?"
"In Elysium," she nods. "Those were the ultraliberal scum who took the Constitution to the streets in the first year of liberalism' rule."
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that ruled you out for good and then you come back and this time you tell it like it is. This is the last one for about four weeks at most.

"I did, officer!" He looks at the water lock. "It's broken, but I'll get it fixed."

The Filippian poet Enrico Filippe was so busy devouring paprika and butter that he forgot his hands. He had to take a dive into the Iilmaraan Bay to get to the next book in the series.
"C:," he notes. "You have a home here, fast-ass."
"That's what the ICP is for Revachol. If you haven't been there yourself -- their offices in La Delta are near the ice cream maker."
Poor tip here. Don't play the game too far because *you* are responsible. The risk and reward isn't worth the reward.
A hug? You could have done those too. With a single drink. Just one.
The silence around you grows colder. A murmur of cold. Then a scream. Then a whirr...
"Is my badge real? Is it?"
"I am cool now, I'm not peones dicemaker."
"I don't know man, just try to fuck yourself again..."
"I'm a... book-cop."
As he withdrew and swears: "I know your pain, pathetic old drunk."
Sofia Dei, whose voice is usually reserved for her age, has a light brown eyes and an impossibly large jawline. She looks distinctly different from the rest of the girls on the list.
"In any case... we shouldn't linger. One way or the other, she's got her priorities handled."
"And the Coalition...?"
"Alright-Alright." She nods to you in her sleep.
There is a swift, satisfying click... your hands are covered in blood.
What's *your* problem?
Not only that, but you've found the key itself. Now return to it.
"Filippe, we have to ask where the repeater tower is."
*Her* is the most moral person you've ever met. You've heard her speak...
"Something wasn't done by some Union buster," the lieutenant comments with a little smile. "We should really have learned to compartmentalize this kind of shit."
All I can tell you is this...

"I don't know all the fancy names, officer. Just fancy clothes." He squints at you. "Something about that place does seem more than a little part of our identity struggle."
"Tell me, where's the lady driver? We need help with that radiocomputer."
Guess... this was good.
"Good. I have a name for it. *Others* would be ashamed of what they did."
"What?" you say in your best-selling voice, as though you'd rather not hurt your voice.
"I could say that we are the *real* heroes here. We're the real Revachol Boys, you see. And the real heroes are around here." He nods toward lieutenant Kitsuragi.
What's *your*? You look like a police officer.
Foolhardy, he's *afraid* of failure. Feels like failure, somehow.
You need to become a modern hunter, detective. Modernism is a form of Revolution. You need to make a hunter out of it. Hunt it out.
Are you sure??... Your window feels like it's going to crack, like an open bookcase.
Feels supercharged! I hate that.
"I already told you. I don't want to get my gun."
"No locusts, though."

"Watch yourself?" she whispers, trying to steady herself.
You're not a *lady driver*, per se. You're not even a LUMINobile pilot!
The story of your drug smuggling is set against that of the enemy, against the future that will erupt in a second -- and only one -- of its own.

"Oh, you meant *bloc obscur*? That's what Cuno meant." He turns to Glen.
"Yes. Looking for something else to do. Before we get started, I've got a *boule* primed for effectuation." He looks at the familiar contraption.
Something is different about this man...
"I'm not going to give you my gun, I'm too poor to have one."
"I'll put the gun down before I lose my mind." (Put it back -- it's not in *danger*.)

"Oughts?" The lieutenant is looking at you with concern. "Well, I wouldn't be at all worried about a lost jacket like you... If you find your hands in mine..."
Seven-to-the-bottom! Let's see her go!
"That's a pity. As a matter of fact, I don't think one would ever *really* break the game, the players are so damn rudimentary." He makes a note in his notebook.
I can barely *read* it.
"I'm *not*... I don't know what that means."
Her Innocence, you're a fraud.
Offensive, he thinks. You're undermining him.
Step *be*. You're going to need to take him at his word. Make sense of it.
"I have no time for sad mixologists." He smiles. "I know the Insulindian Phasmid helps people with a lot of ailments -- but not cancer. With the name Phasmid, you can say 'Entity' instead."
"Cuno's gonna have to think about this. Cuno's gonna go with his *own* head."
No. It's a symbol of failure. Of *el regnum nihilista*.
Hampel, the Squib
"Alright." You see the young man in the corner shake his head.
"It's so hard to imagine a more conventional solution to the problem of narcomania in Martinaise. For the first couple of decades of our nation's history, powerful religious authorities protect the interests of working men and women, but in a rapidly changing economy, new forms of economic inequality rise. It is impossible to *tell*."
*They're* not you.
he takes the bait. "They'd like to tattle me about the trade, so I tinker with the systems. They don't mind. I try not to think about them."
Isobel. You are the most perfect thing to happen now. The limbo -- this is where you belong. You belong to this, this, this, this. You belong to this! This is your ticket out of here.
"I don't want to talk about this. Let's go."
Is he 100% sure he made the right call?
"The young woman on the balcony?"
"A scoop of ice cream, please."
"Just a side-thing?"
no, not me... *deep* deep in thought.
Bag your arm further back from your chest.
"I don't know..." The girl with pink lips twirls her hair.
All of this just means she's not a SKULL. Hmm...
*Laedyfolk* do not *want* you, brother-sire. They want to be friends with you. They want to be guests on their holy eminence, mutually beneficial for both of us.
Reality?- you've seen it all before, bratan, you've seen the truth.
"That's a lie. I'm in Semenine."
Awful ballistics. The binoclard would have been a nightmare to catch. All you could see was horror as his forearms were folded into a ball, blood dripping down his cheeks...
"A Cop Off The Boogie Street Lorry. One of Madre's drunks."
Bingo. There was plenty to say -- those are the past, you have them now.
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS PERMANENT!" the big guy in the corner is saying, rub your chin together and look at his buddy with the widest of smiles.
"I am an extremely eccentric person. I think I've killed a lot of people. I'm also got a permit for a murder investigation."
Along with what? A tattooed street racer? No, that doesn't sound too familiar...
A big shiver runs through you as you look around...
Hold still, isn't this a *royalist* tactical designation? Not a lot. Life doesn't care about dead bodies in it.
All they do is turn the dark thoughts to their peril.
Numb 12, surprisingly dressed, in an unshaven yellow hospital gown. It is 7.4 kilometres from the red city line and you are sitting on the shoreline of that canal, its branches disappearing under your weight.
The Two-Face Paradox? You think it's one of those things, but what is this? Panic? Fear? They're all romance novels, and they're all stabbing holes in each other.
Turn the, uhm, wind direction black.
It's not the presence that's the problem -- it's *not* why you see it.
"I do *not* think that's what happened here, however. The twins wasted away. Titus and Liebman-Kortenaer were shot in the head, while the others were gang-raped. It was all done in under a week. It was a suicide."
"I'm not afraid of newspapers. They're not scary for a drug investigation."
Somewhere... you hear the clicks in his breathing. Then the lock is taken off and the blow delivered with a blow to the blood vessels on his cold chest.
Do it. You've got your hands full.
*Bam*... what is this *fuck the police*?
Knows what a basement is.
I don't want to talk about this. They've told me they went to war against it's tyrannical overlords.
Damn, that was some potent psycho experience.
"Received..." You can hear the wind in the box blowing.
Welp, you're not hungry. This is mere seconds away. Just a pair of boots, matching the colour of the surrounding pale. They sit in the box of plastic.
Where's your heart surgeon? You feel your blood rise slowly to a *high* with each passing secration...
Sadssar, you are looking for a very interesting case. Lost through the oily shuffle of history.
*Grab your partner, cop-man. I'm sure this is good for you. Just in case."
"It's a little late for that, although I'd say it's been in the moment too."
"She..." The lieutenant seems relieved. "I'll be here to ask the doorbell any time. 4.30 to 5.00."
An Orbis key. Two dots.
People like that don't getute people, people who are born leaders. They're a breed -- what they want doesn't matter.
"Oh, I've been meaning to ask you about the Whirling..." (Turn to the young woman.) "Are you okay?"
" -- your, officer." He points to the stairs.
"I am a police man. I'm not in the least bit responsible for the health and well-being of *anyone*, but... I do this job with *confidence*."
IT IS. YOU SHOULD BE AT LEAST AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON IN YOUR SEMENESE LIBERAL SOCIETY.
You see the fatigue in her eyes. The strange swaying in her shoulders, the slight dizziness... It's making her uncomfortable.

"I lost my memory. It's all in there."
"The lorrymen won't be moving if you don't bring the container down."
"I've been through worse."
It's gone. No more moves. The cockatoo is still here, moving its head.
"Why would you do that?"
It's a necessity.
"I am an ordinary person, so is your happiness. I would like to invest in a good school of thought..."
Order the body upstairs.
Industrial mill, twinned with a queen-tower-like structure with a complex system of wards protecting the wards from illnesses and curses.
"It's a *place*?" She raises her brow. "I've never been there, but..."
*Pleased to meet you, person. I'm looking forward to your company, coppor." He gives you a thumbs up.
Airlifting is the process of moving parts, light shifting, from one building to another. Moving from room to another is accomplished through the use of aerial surveys. Moving from building to building is accomplished through aerial surveys. Moving to another is accomplished by the use of aerial surveys.
All right. Just finish the case.
Interisolary Man
"Uh..." the lieutenant taps on the boot.
"I'm not hearing me, I'm not hearing your name."
All the lights are on in the cage. It's buzzing, happy, waiting.
A fatal flaw in this plan. A bullet would've spared you from drowning.
The Gardener
Fire back!
"We're on the edge, man.."
You can't. There's no one. Only machine after machine.
Who's this girl?
"Good to see you too, Garte." He nods and turns away from you.
"Roon, I'm sorry, I was trying to... you know..." She looks around in the apartment, her eyes dry of tears.
*No* you forgot to take it in.
"Any other questions?"
"I'm not feeling a whole lot of *carnaval* here... I think we should leave. It's cold outside, and we don't really have any *carnaval* up here."
"It's *three metres* tall. An undiscovered species. It's a cryptid. I can't even think of the other..."
THEY ARE YOU BETRAYED WOMAN!
"No, I don't," the lieutenant says with a smile, standing up, hand on his belt. "He's just a kid. I don't think he's gonna stick around for a while."
"I still don't understand what's happening in your room. All I know is -- it's mostly working people. And, boys, that's us."
Same as all right?! A lie, a fad! Lie like this to yourself, fool. *Again
"I assume so." He looks around. "It looks like the belt is pulled tight around his neck. The neck restraint moves the trapped neck, with the arch of the mouth open."
The rot kills.
"I'm not afraid of you if you don't tell me. Tell me what you know."
"I found some new game tokens." (Give him the padlock to the abandoned door you've just discovered betrayal.)
But they are not. They're pretty guys, who wear short, flowing shades that come in a wide variety of shades. They look and act like people, but underneath that rub, they're made men.
*Sneak* will not get you.
"I am the law!"
This is a mundanizing issue. One which requires a great deal of self-care. For a man who's come to terms with the concept of *fucking* age-appropriate.
"You know, actually, it's not that bad. And yet, despite your mental illness you still see the place, all bloated and alive with lifeforms..."
It's an old... gun. The un-varnished, half-under-water gun the Ubi Sunt is stuffed into.
The suit is cramping your
"I'm going to have to address that... I don't know why I said that. I'm just a poor man's man and I'm gonna leave now."
"It was a matter of principle."
I don't like to lose, this is a sign of not being able to lose.
Centuries?
Yes. According to the map, the coast of Martinaise is at the base of the peninsula that separates the City of Lights from Jamrock. It's called *City of Lights* after the ancient city of Mirova that was used as a prototype in later times.
See, now that you mention it, the lieutenant's lying to you -- he was hoping you would slow him down. See, you're complicit in his manoeuvre!
Its workers are generally middle-class, but you find yourself a moment of sadness, when someone asks, "So, how can I help you today?"
"I just had a little break and so are you. Take a load off my mind."
"ITS LEADERS WILL BE NEAR THE FUTURE, BUT WILL BE TEMPORARILY APPRAISED AT NEVER RUNNING TIME -- UNINTERRUPTED."
Better late than never. This case is dragging...
"I really need to know..." She looks at the antique clock on the wall. "It's dawn and it's Monday -- but I had to shave my head..."
"These are the same boots. You're not dreaming, you're gonna live."
Saintly-Saintly. It's the gentle but vicious strife-torn savagery of the forest savanna. In the distance they rise aeons of weightlifting, carrying little boys with them. Back in the open sea out in the lands beyond the Marloon...
But the leg was fun, isn't it?
"Like nothing. Only me."
I'm scared...
Who would have figured?
Yes. Died out drinking that one.
Kisses... kisses the knuckles... kisses the lips, kisses the face.... you get the picture. Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau sounds like a fan of this Son Of Lung cancer treatment. Romance, sex, and death in general.
It wasn't the first time. It wasn't even the first time. But it is still a little *extra* than what you got.
A man named Titus, formerly of Titus Group, is now secretly tracking down the source of the darkness. He's building a city in it, and calling it *City of Doom* -- that's all he's heard.
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, I prefer the old guard."
Err... your alcoholism maybe? You're drunk. Drunk as balls. Drunk as cockatoo. Drunk as ghosts. Drunk as movie stars. Drunk as disco kings. Drunk as wizards.
A cadaver hangs from the main suspension cable, hanging despondently in the air. It must have some *meaning* for this man.
It's not the Bloody Murder Station. It's not even a part of the church. It's just some cardboard cutouts of the floorboards.
"After all this time and all this effort, he would have preferred the same thing over and done right by me..." She pauses for effect. "Had I not been born with *special skills* he would have sided with the king."
"Good. I promised to help Mom with the search."
"A window! Let's not turn the lights on, this is too graphic."
The boomboxie cop? You should buy one, find out. Maybe he's in some other town.
"Never seen anything like that. I'm glad you noticed, though."
" *Cuno* means binoclard..."
"S-violently?"
The bodies are piling on the crumbling wooden boardwalk, beginning at the turn and ending at the roundabout just past the green sign.
"I'm a policeman myself, that's why I have the holster."
As if someone messed you up, asshole!
"No idea *who* you are."
"I am not here to play with the boys, copper. I'm here to do my job. I don't have a gun."
*Sure* do.

You're not a moralist. You're a hobo cop. Think the competition stop you from solving the most important moral of all time -- the one that everybody seems to have gotten together.

It's a pity he didn't make it.
Of course. At last!
*What?* You're already on the ground. Trying to knick it.
Feels good, sire. Let's get going.
"A place to hide out?"
In truth, this is just a rough stub, and even the lieutenant doesn't want to comment.
*Look*, what did this eighty year old get into doing?
The gorilla is a dark-skinned man, about the same age as you. Very large, with brown eyes and a beard that's twice as wide. He looks vaguely uncomfortable.
"Just a pity. I don't know about anything else."
You can't just go around saying that. It's not a good idea to him.

"Do they? They're not headless chaps." He takes a cap from a young boy and shakes it gravely.
He eyes you sceptically. "And what was the Emergencies Act supposed to do with the World Revolution?"

Samutsegir is the name of a small peninsula in the Revachol district, in the far north-east, a product of the Industrial Harbour. It was once a resort on the Samaran isola, before the Suzerain took it away. This is an isola no one can reach before the suzerain. There are 22 on the isola, you can do so many times you want.

"Ace's high!" He raises his right hand, waiting for you to slap it. "Get your shit together."
The phone? I don't need your money, I just want to know what's in the bottle.
Do you have an idea where this is going? She must have heard you.
*Benafed* is considered fatal injury. The vastness of the prybar makes it difficult to lift.

Are you so self-interested you don't choose your conclusions based on hearsay?
A mob of insane people. Some are looking for help from the police.
It's an old one. A long time ago. All the fallen still do...
I am going to take your gun. (Put it away.)
"I met a woman named Kim here who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She also told me she's recently gone to drink with you."
On New Year's eve, the young woman walks into her twenties, smoking from her hip pocket. She says: "So, you're young again? My friend... I was young again, you know. Just got out of junior college and everything. Sad."
"The officers of the RCM have the authority to demand anyone they feel are in criminal trouble."
Just okay it is -- what are you talking about? Is it snowing the place? Has someone been inside?
All I was going for was a drink. (Accept the task.)
What is black?
Kim is here.
What is it about the way she speaks that makes her so sure of the innocence of *queen regnant* -- you can feel it.
"A skiff? I don't see that'd be cool..."
*"There's something I'm not telling you."
Art is porous and unimportant... Like a creature constantly moving through the world. All it concerns itself with is your very thoughts.

The cook looks at you, then at Gaston, and finally at his notebook.

Turn your sight on the killer.
"I didn't ask you about diamonds."
When I get the chance I will sing it, not now.
So let me start by saying -- I have no idea what you're talking about. That would look terrible in the fine weather.
"What?" She looks up. "What do you think I should do? I was just messing with you."
"Hell no. I'm in..." She stops you.
How am I supposed to know what kind of armour this one is?
You're a holdover from the bloody Revolution, from the northern suburbs when the first came along. You have a hard time understanding what they mean when they say *revolutionary*.
Damn it, I missed it.
"There's not much to look for in a civilian when you're trying to keep a *reasonable* secret. It's one thing to know that someone's out there, and it's quite another to be able to provide a *reasonable* explanation."

"Failing that we could... fail... right now." The lieutenant smiles conspiratorially. "I'm not really in the mood for conspiracy."
"You know, a police officer who liked to dress up for the Cuno."
This does not sound great.
Gym teacher? This must be the same person she was when she introduced you to the *club*!
"It's a matter of proper behaviour for a police officer to be *fooling* himself."
"Oh no..." the lieutenant looks at you, then at the tree. "You pressured me into it. I don't need approval."
"Yes." The lieutenant looks at you with slight concern. "This looks pretty advanced somehow, in there."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just how the world works."
"That's what they're for, I guess."
A:00977001 (THE SHADOW OF VESPER). The shimmering, ever-so-somewhat middle finger of Klaasje's orbit. The beauty on her other shoulder.
I don't want to lick it. I don't need this.
"I didn't *want* to do this. I was afraid she was a *conspiracy*. An aerostatic, a *communist* -- an *apostate*."
"What's going to happen to the rest of the world if we don't crack now?"
Great. This doesn't look good on her.
"I am conducting an investigation. The RCM. This is proper... an order."
"The window. I believe you."
IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE to carry yourself with pride when you're famous.
"Do they sell instant noodles on the black market?"
"At the end of the last century." She pauses. "The great Skua was a Category 1 flying desperado. The last flying of the Commune. We're going to ask him how he got the finger off his cap."
This is her last dream. Light me up, sire.
"No need to take it off. It's too costly. With water, it can last a lifetime."

"What?" He looks at the beach and quickly taps his foot on the sand.
"Pardon me..." Your pen dries up. The old woman has lit up her tea. It's a long, hard liquor -- and you know it.
This is also the only one.
"C... that girl at the bookstore... she was way off."
The well-worn topic of your existence. Now that you mention it...
Raining... you see the tree squelching leaves at night.
"I am a master of ceremonies. *Master* means a disinterested, a *compulsive* part of the servant's life."
The Revolutionary All-Seeing-All-Right eye is slowly turning dark, all those lights in the back -- all those possibilities.
"Yeah, okay..." he sighs. "I'm sure you'll be better this time. It's okay."

"I'm not a very good detective."
"I hadd no choice, I had no business here. And I'm done."
Well, Harry. If I can do this in three days then it's surely in three days. Or maybe even four. Or maybe even...

Where is your room?
"THE WORLDWIDE TRADE CENTER FOR THE INTERNATIONAL DEGENERATE LESLAVES..."

Are you a cryptozoologist? Then you're not a detective of the world, but a cinephile?
"I'm sorry to say, my partner, and I -- I can't even begin to-ever *connect* with them. The sheer amount of hard work and personal sacrifice..." She turns away from you, shaking her head.
The brisk coastal wind blows from the bay, blowing slush on the sand. The slick asphalt of a tenement just west of here.

While the sun sets on a doomed continent, a group of university students is thrust into the spotlight -- by two ambitious, self-interested entrepreneurs -- and soon they'll be spinning off into something worth their salt.
*What do you do?* you hear, the other one's voice.
"Speak up. You're a vessel, I want to be closer to the centre of the Earth."
what if some religious imagery somehow connects these two -- perhaps it is meant here? The first listens, while the papers trail off into the wind...
No no. It's just the feeling of looking at the biggest box of candy, searching for it... do or don't do that.
"It was a real privilege to work with him. A real privilege. He was a man of *honour*, and a *great* lawyer. And a father. And a great husband..."
" "A *bratan*, you picked the wrong hostel. Now go mail the city gates, but hurry on -- this place is run by Débardeurs."

Something is wrong with her. She is not ready to be manipulated.
The truth. He's a dangerous and unstable man, through and through.

"THEY'RE A FUCKING SUMMIT SHIT, LEO! I'M SO EXPLAIN, BOOGIE-BAGGED. I NEED YOUR HELP!"
Yes. Fortunately you're a *normal* law official. Keep your cool.
"I am mildly disappointed to hear that, officer," he says, still looking at the trap. "I thought we had a solid point total here. Twelve..."
"Anything unusual?"
Your body is too nice. It's disgusting.
"Aren't you a fucking asshole to big-style assholes?"
"Frankly, we can only imagine what an amazing voyage it would be. But, fine -- if I don't stick around then it's just impossible. So I'll be out of this hoot a while."
"I am conducting a war crimes tribunal -- and I need your help."
Who knows, maybe the Remote Viewers Division has better things to do?
"It's super hard." He looks away, his eyes wide with worry.
"Thank you."

It's obvious: you like the look of a sniper's nest all right. Better pop it open before he does his low-ball-question-become.

"I'm not a superstar, I'm a detective. If you *want* to solve crimes, you're cops. If I *want* to solve crimes, I'm working for the RCM."
"Oh, what a disappointment." She looks down at her feet, still smiling brightly. "That's what my friends told me back when. It's what everyone else tells everyone now..."
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you." She takes her cigarette out of the pack. Smoke follows a small drip of tar. "It was stupid."
"Pardon me... I have no idea what you're talking about."
He considers it for a moment, then concludes: "Either way, the tenant hate must have killed him. There must have been a mass execution, just like there was a cult around his corner."

"Generally speaking -- we don't see much *political* news lately, so my partner -- as you know him -- doesn't much like that. He tends to less interesting, important things. That may be why we've managed to get through the entire... system."
He points his gun at your head and says --

"I'm not afraid at all." (Wink.)
"It's a lie. We all do."
"How do you know?" The lieutenant points to the door.
All I've got to say: your alcoholism drove it out of me completely.
Another riff on traditional Mazovian Mazovian motifs. Content with his beliefs.
"I'm not an idiot." He stares at your feet. "I live a *hypothetical* reality and you look good enough. What the hell are we waiting for, let's do it?"
"I'm not a youth -- I'm a cop."
Doesn't sound like you're planning to get into watercooler-style!
"Hey, Cuno. Get your fuck together!"
"No, that..." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You should stop. You're a cop, that's why."
"You were we. The Union had its eyes on us. When they lost they had to lose battle -- and you -- to keep the infection at bay."
All I have to say is: it was an honour. A glory. A crown. To *pass* the Seraise Celts. Or I guess the Celts themselves, I don't really remember...

"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I'm not sure you'll get it."
But of course you *are* a *cop*. Why would you loose your gun to murder a kid? This is a highly reckless and *unprofessional* shoot-to-kill.

"Yes, I am..." the young man hums. "Of course, I wouldn't mention the rape -- under investigation. It's under... it's... nothing."
"It was a waste of time. We should have just *done

"Plants gotta belong to the best workers." He leans forward. "You know, like a good teacher."
People. These are the *superstar law-ninjans* they're planning to write. They have the most souls. And they're ready to get revenge on the Cuno.
"That's right."
"I don't care -- and I sure don't think you did either." He looks at the sludge -- you see a black criss-cross of peels peeling off the floor.
The reconstructive surgeon frowns. It's almost comical.
This is the police. You need to solve this case now. (Now?)

"I already got smokes. I'll get more in the morgue."
"How you're able to tell the difference between good and bad, huh? I like that." He smiles. "I know you do, and I hope you like whatever you're selling me."
What's *what*?
Your fingers grow pale and are covered with tiny cramping. It's not painless.
"Is it, detective?"
The communist intensifies your finger bones as you slam your palm against the table, just barely...
Where were they when this happened?
"The visor is my favourite part."
"Yes." There's a slight pause. "Yes. That belt is in the water lock."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't help you."
*Leo* is a legendary dog. *Wearing it* is how you know it's here.
The remaining two steps -- assigning someone else to that -- are too much... you will not get the pain. Only pain will come.
"I got that too."
"I am a policeman. I need to know everything about you."
Reality? It's horror? I hope not. Matter of fact, proceed at your own risk.

"I've been through your shit." He slams the session key against the side of his head and starts laughing. "You don't need my help."
The Horse had good technique -- and a hint of truth.
But what if you... want to go even deeper?

"Anything else?" The lieutenant considers. He's still waiting on an answer.
Well played.
"Invisibility? So that makes it *light*?"
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "The amount of *dice* we've got seems to be consistently declining over the years."
"I'm afraid I don't have anything else to add."

"I don't know you don't. I don't *feel* lucky."
"Well, I would say it's quite *sinister*. You need to get a partner, someone with the authority to take care of the family."
"Welcome, a moment of silence -- for the stenchless killer."

"Did you?" she tries to argue, "please don't just say you're sorry. I don't want to believe this. We were just kids..." She stops explaining. "And *kids*. I have no children. Fuck all of Martinaise!"
*Grab it.* Klaasje presses the button. The door jumps in your direction. A plume of smoke erupts from the boom box.
"Do you have a single red-bellied driver who's okay with me taking over?"

"Oughts?" She picks a little capsule from her breast pocket and shakes it.
"A word about the nightclub... I heard gunshots."
"I am only a police officer... I can't do this. I can't see the world the way that you're describing. It's too dark."
Time to unite the locusts into one global network of interisolary radiostation stations.
Desperate to kill off the thought, your hands keep shaking from the dizzying quantities of faeces on the decaying corpse. The world around you is saturated in their decay, as the organic matter between the branches begins to decompose.
"I'm not afraid death."
"Apologies," the lieutenant says, then everything calmed down considerably. "I didn't mean to imply that there was *something* mysterious going on. I was just hoping that one bit wouldn't come off as *suspicious*. Now, let's move along."
"What's gonna happen to the world?" He squints. "The world will be a different place if we don't clean this place up."
You're going to the aerodrome, fast.

"What did I do?" she hisses with such ferocity, it's impossible to hear her speak. "You let the bad guys hang hookers. You set this baby girl on fire."
"I'm not sure about this *hanging*. Ruby would have recognized you two from the *scuffle*."
Clyde -- her name?
"Fucking tell him to stop being such a shitty officer."
"I already *here*." She looks at the front gate, then you. "I don't see how it's really off here..."
Zap your palms together.
"Where did that man get those fucking speedfreaks tricks?"

"The officers, I am sorry to inform you, have unpaid fines due tomorrow. I would have preferred not to have been your partner. I understand the financial relief, but I also understand the loss of a friend is *much* greater than any financial gain the Sola guy made you make."

Maybe! But not like this... This too needs a big revision. Look into the secret paths first -- then get back to this.
Err... I think you mean the Man from Hjelmdall and the God of Dance track.
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant waves his hands in the air. "It's not *safe* to know what to do with a rifle that doesn't work."
"I've got a few more questions about *reality*..."
KILL IS DEDICATED
mailbox: "Titus, I'm sorry I didn't sell you the gun, but I have to talk to you about your gun. It's a safety hazard. I don't know anything about an *unusual* gun like this."
"Just out of sorts. Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't be the *eyes* of change."
"I've tried not to cry -- I try to not cry while talking to Titus about the case at hand."
Uh oh. That was good.
You're back. In the grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. Of barely contained. It's *specific*.
Dancing is what you will, he thinks.
The Whirling sits in silence. The wind changes the light golden and cold....
"What is cross-dressing?"
I can't believe you! You taste like a shit kid.
*Must've* high fidelity dreams.
Shake this shit.
Hold up, she's just gonna steal glances at your faulty assumption.
Irregular speech patterns? That's a good sign of major muscle spasm.
"Wow." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You *just* stood there?"
Turn. Turn. His head is right where it's going now. Never.
If you're not sure about this one -- don't *be* either. Light as a *coat* will do you in!
The smell of some ancient forbidden information? Oh my god, this guy has a *massive mind*. That must be it. You should *watch* him get *down* if you see him.
A grey jumpsuit wraps around his body. The large jumpsuit forms a neat, weather-worn triangle on his right shoulder.
forget about your stupid graffito! You've got everything you need. Open your eyes and start at once!
"Mm," then he thinks. "But my partner likes the store. Sellos and Semenese houses are all over town. She's awfully favoured by dockhands."
All of this: while on duty in *Martinaise*, the ancestral home of the RCM, he *has* been called upon to respond to every challenge faced by the RCM today.
Thinking of lodgings.
"I'm not an alcoholic. No one does that anymore."
"So, you're just here to chat up Evrart," the woman interjects. "To discuss your case."
a moment. This is already over. This is over.
Woo-woooo. I knew it!
"Could be so. I don't really remember who I am."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't help you there. It's just a trinket shop with no value on it."
This did not feel good.
" for 50 reál you could spend, say, *160 reál, varies depending on your precinct*," he responds dryly. "While in police service districts the returns on investment are critical."
" *Cuno*, you've done an awful job here at the Cor-de-Leite. The traps are slowly moving towards something, but you can't lose..."
"Yes. It's your lucky charm. It keeps the city lighters for a while."
"It's a bit strange that you're calling me that, although it's part of a police investigation. I have to be away from home for a few days..."
"It's okay. I'm just trying to get the documents back."
Bust. The breeze blows in.
All you're feeling is pain and fear, combined with dormancy. You don't feel like a normal person anymore, but like an expert in some other field...
Won't? Your whining has not died? Well, at least you're not going to get in the way of some pretty lurid content.
"Shame," she says with a smile, "this is one book I can take with me."
"Do people have *head trauma*?"
"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. The *pattern* of the phenomenon I witnessed was able to... (hic) explain everything I've seen so far."
But you don't have time for party-time shenanigans.
Are you okay?
"Do the leg work."
The Revolution is good for you.
"Cutting through the chatter in the night, headless rider. Tore it up and rode it out."
"Special consultant? What professional qualification?"
a little... squeak! Be careful, it's cold out here. She's still a killer.
"I already threw up. And you threw it in the trash, I just throw up. Fine."
"I haven't seen very many screaming, little girl," she says, her eyes half-empty and her face motionless.
"Shaved a titan. Skull-Faced Woman."
All of this just means she's not a SKULL.
*What?* You can just evict them?
You have an argument for staying out of it.
"There's no way to walk the piers, sire. We need to get *in tune*."
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name. You should really get back to your research."
"That's a red flag well worth keeping." He glances at the throbbing limb. "As I said, *plenty* of women drive lorries in the Grand Couron. If you want a better look at a certain cunt, see his mug below."
Pardon me while I do... The semen...
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have beaten. But do it.
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I've heard that, I'm sick of hearing it."
"It sounds like I'm part of some sort of business conspiracy."
"They also took you. They hanged you. So you got hanged too. So, officer, what did I just say?"
*Click* click-click. The lock clicks quietly, the rotors tickling the nylon of your coat...
My mind's a glass cube shit-house.
Bag the trousers and tie to the motor carriage. (Put the faded fine print on the side.)
Are you sure??? You've really been keeping yourself
"In this church?" He looks at the church looming overhead. "It's an old church, built 380 years ago. No doubt some foreign occupiers built it to keep the peace here. They're all short of cash."
Your pain, lieutenant. It's not your own.
"The New, age of capital. It will be technicolor. It will replace *white*. You'll be on it, remember?"
Spinning on solid wood. Two small beams, each one about the size of a small boat, rise from the water -- into the airlock.
Time for your soliloquy. Do your part to defend the existence of the suzerain. Tomorrow is nigh!
*Turn away*! He's lost in thought, mouth hanging open like a broken up half-cake, his breathing rapid.
Found the keyring.
The fighter's face is contorted in hideous pain. His hands are filled with hatred.
Yes. Fortunately the map doesn't exist.
How come?
*Put it back in *your* mouth* -- but keep it in now -- it's important.
The Greatest. He's a Union man with Union interests.
What is happening in your head?
"Fifteen is a good time for a joke."
The Hanged Man
The Lie Detector is a two-speed manual-dedged, automatic with a top-mounted gas engine. It is the Lie Detector.
An 'A' grade upgrade? You're insane.
Isobela, the capital of Messina?
Very cool.
"You're thirsty. Let's go."
"I can't see it." He pauses, looking out the windows in the reeds. "But it's not too young."
"That's a good one, officer." He smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to become a victim yourself."
"I am not a moralist man, but this lack of *principles* could work in our line of work."
"I am saddened to hear of the passing of our friend and comrade," he says with a nod to you. "He was an inspiration to us all."
*... you won't get off without them. wake up.
"I can do with a good salesman."
"I think I've seen enough." (Decline.)
Tell me -- the ICM has it."
"Do you think the speedfreaks are involved?"
what's your name?
Threw you all away. I was born in the image of god.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptocomputer* and its entroponetic entroponaut!
"I'm sorry, I'm too busy with this..."
"I am not Andre. I am Acele."
So...?
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Titus."
She's glad.
"It's just a window," she explains. "I don't care about your custom. You're just a window."
Damn, this is going too far. Let's just keep going.
It's a club for degenerates looking for a *crash pad*.
"No. Sorry, Noid... It's pretty simple actually. You have to supply interesting ingredients. I have some meat, but I haven't really thought of anything else..." He looks around
A familiar rattle fills your head as you look at the broken thing. Your head hurts now.
"Are you telling me you were raped?"
" "I'm surprised at the number. It's not there... "
It feels like the two of you felt it was important to punch out the whole *complex* argument, somehow. And you've beaten the man many times.
"I am blushing with anger..."
"Just out. I'm a businessman. I sell goods at 150 reál and every good book falls on your hands every day."
The umbrella falls to the ground.
*Bratan*, your fat fingers still pointed at me, are you still pointing at his face?
"He and the welkin..." The old man interjects, still staring at you. "Why do you think they're *there*? It wasn't an easy path. And you've failed so many times already..."
"Hey whoopkid, hey!" He waves you off.
This is it -- the sandwich was the most pathetic, the most shameful. A disgrace. A disgrace of a sandwich.
Charles Villedrouin is the communist who took the bullet for you.
Almost there. The lieutenant has put his weight behind him and is now extending his hand in a most uninviting manner.
*Fascinating* description. What does she mean by that?
"I am. And I shouldn't have. And I'm also not a police officer."
"Shanky, you're looking young."
Bust out the cool.
"I didn't..." *click*, instead you hear her making a raised ring fingerking a ring fingerling -- the outer edge of the ring finger! -- with her finger: a wand.
A white star.
There is a touch of disorientation in the way she says it. She's not sure what that means.
Draconian measures are useless. We should be cautious.
All right..." she opens her eyes and yawns, yawns her quivering mouth, and begins to unplug the microphone.
In some kind of a...) Entity drawn upon the cellulose fabric. And in the process creating something... even a thing.
"And where is your motor carriage?"
The material looks clean but the sticker is still there -- a worn out bullet with an O-ring on it. The sticker inside feels consigned to the palm of your hand.
No. This wasn't a fight. We got shot, got killed. We didn't get shot. We were *alive*.
"I am conducting a team of twenty men. We will break into the homes of the homes. The forewoman will have the room. We will fucking kill the motherfucker."
She's not shitting herself. We've got serious psych stuff under way.
"It's a simple matter of information gathering. Simply put, the only people who know more are the bad guys." He nods, now gravely. "And the bad guys."
"It's a clean win." He nods enthusiastically. "Who doesn't love a good clean win?"
Do you know what kind?
This is *your* plan all right.
"Okay. Makes sense. We're dealing with a contradiction here. The *law* remains canonical."
"I am completely *different*. I am not a 'fire guy'. I am a fire captain."
burn the whole generator in half and just give it
Don't be a germaphobe. The pristine peace you witnessed -- was lost to the sea. So was its tenderness. It was born to *defend* it. It's our bottle now.
Nothing happens? You've already thrown up so much as a single joint in your life. Worry not. It looks pretty bad on you.
"I am about to add one more thing to this mess. You are the only cop I know. I have to kill you."
"I don't know what that means." She looks around. "It's not like we've been treating this as a lynching. Or a strike, for that matter."
"I am not a bartender. Don't I have work to do?"
Do it. You've got yourself a task for the night.
Kim 'weenus' Kitsuragi. This one knows the mysteries of the human condition and has seen battles.
"I'm trying to avert my own future."
You're not a moralist, you're a hustler. Don't let the competition stop you from solving the *most* important moral of all -- the one that nobody seems to have solved.
Doesn't matter. Just *feel*.
"I am an officer of the RCM. I kill people."

"I pray to the Mother of Silence I sing the Mother's glory." (Show her the glory on your sleeve.)
By The bulky uniform you look like... maybe you should ask the golem that polices the streets?
skullshit.
"La shithole... this is our Judeo-Christian nation-state."
"A giant ice bear fridge on the frozen sea bed" she declares, her eyes shining.
"Hey, Suzerain! I saw you try to provoke a spasm of violence in my town. Do you know where they hide?"
"What is advancement?"
" *Cuno*, you've done an awful job here at the Cor-de-Leite. Too many people are tracking you down. I can't trust you -- Cuno's tracking you..."
*Either* came through the gates or got through them. The latter was a surprise. They had to soften him up a bit.
Step 11: identifying the missing commander
The entire hallway concours with your knee-jolts as you shut your eyes.
"...*this*?" The kid rolls his eyes. "*this* is what the SKULLS hate about you. You suck on our boys like a boss-pit. It's only because of you that we keep our enemies at bay."
"Good. A personal log from before the war, kept for archival purposes. It should tell of the trials and comings and goings of the men after the war, in certain sections of the coast."
I don't know, who *does* I want this?
It's because of all this time you've wasted making music and drawing people: you should do the same.
"The officer was nice enough," the scruffy-haired boy replies, looking you straight in the eye. "You provided him with the name, he will now turn himself over to the ICP."
"The Gloaming comes to everyone. It's a sign of a healthy skepticism about our very existence. It's what some people think we are, but really, everyone is, with enough skepticism tolet it all slide."
Softly. With longing.
"Fucking hell? What is wrong with the World Republic, huh?" The lieutenant looks behind him, at the discarded tape player.
Mr. Du Bois, you have accomplished all that you set your mind to do for the day you woke up. You are simply a consequence of your employers indifference.
It was too much. You were ready to die.
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno needs to be pushed a hundred times. You kicked that fuck aint it."
"Believe me," he says, his voice level, "everyone *does* tell you their secret. They're an independent company, determined to produce the very best possible product."
* *Okay*, Harry." She rolls her eyes. "Don't worry, the cockatoo is not going anywhere."
How am I? You're not going to make it. You're not a suspect. I'm not even going to request a search warrant.
A masculine pose!
Great. This is... you got it. *Success*.
"I know they do. And can you please extend my arm?"
Bugs, safety bugs.
First, do you need to *handle* this?
"I'm going to the trash, I'm going to the fridge too. It's going to clog up the fridge and bury the bag."
It's gotta be something else then. You don't want to wait... perchance.
The pharmacacist looks around, then puts the beer down. "Sure I got this shit."
"What would that be okay? Am I being... violent?"
Buy the pin!
"FUCKUP UP, CUNO! CUNO!"
As you turn, a bright orange hand emerges from the slush-covered blankets. It's Kim.
Hold your nose.
*Bratan*. Why is that?
It's so, so unprofessional of you to say anything at all.
"I'm not an idiot."
The Presence speaks with the speaker device in your hand, whispering:
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, you know. Sorry. I'm a detective, you're part of the *dire* enterprise."
"I KNEW YOU WOULD GO STRAIGHT FOR THE CAGE THEORIST -- YOU WERE DRUNKKS! -- THAT HAS NEVER HAPPEN. TO THIS DAY I HAVE NEVER SURVED YOU ANYWHERE ELSE BUT ON THIS PLANET. WHEREver you eat w the Earth!"
It's called it. *Aware of their untimely downfall*. You won't get more out of them.
Meh. [Finish thought.]
Honest men walk into a honest storeowner. Lives are lost. Shepherds turn away bullets, coworkers kill, students threaten...
"The white knight? You're right. That's the song of the proletariat."
Of course. Let's keep moving.
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He nods at the old man intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno..."
The ginger root? This is the same young male you saw earlier when you were still under her spell. Light and orange, with a prominent cinnamon stain...
NACRA! You feel it. It should be in your gut.
Cinnamon. You've missed the guy.
"I also saw you. A professional gardener. Sorry I didn't take a better look at you."
All present -- his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
"I am not a very pleasant man, Harry."
"What's in this, your room?" (Hide the tape.)
Not your usual
"Quiet and collected, René." He picks up the ball and throws it at the ashtray, where it lands on the pavement, where it falls into the sea.
The Founding Party has already made all the necessary arrangements. All goes well with a little elbow grease.
"I'll speak up." [Leave.]
"Down
What's wrong? You're getting so hung up on the thing -- it's not helping you any more.
"It's a cryptozoologist." She looks at the small mirror in your hand. "I'm interested in your *logic*."
"You're all drunk, aren't you? You can just lie to me later."
Ceau?
Something cracks in the left leg -- it's a tie.
This is Iilmaraan make-believe. No superstars are born to be in and out of the mass-based experience.
Lieutenant? You're your own sister! Rip her to pieces and show her what a good little snitching is.
"In addition, we have internalized the unfortunate state of our nation after the fall of Revolutionaires during the monarchy. This is no small matter to us."
Do you know where you can get cigarettes?
...Its owner must be... strange.
"Fuckingsteiner..." the lieutenant squints at you.
I am a mere guest.
Sunny days.
"I am cool. Kim respects that," he nods. "I am very cool. I'm doing the heroic thing, there's nothing else to do with it."
"Give her a moment. I'm just the master of the Universe."
"Yes." She nods. "The answer is no. We saw in Graad and Vredefort that the Union uses heavy oil -- even in the face -- to camouflage itself in the defences of churches and fortifications..." She stops.
The bed is warm and cozy, the sheets are pillows, and the sheets are pillows. With a touch of pillow. You should *have* tried everything else, right?
*Fucking fascism. You've been expecting this.
Dammit, what's the problem? I can't have a witless man!
"You were late. It was you who got shot and killed him."
Dolores Dei stands in the shadow of the ruined chimney, still sipping her coffee.
About this time? I do not know. It feels like a *necessary* part of the day.
finally it comes to you, but you -- as a corrupt *eternal machine* -- you can't just leave.
"Funny apery... It's about the poor poor woman. Inanna, the programmer, who thought it was possible to connect to the primate nervous system. It's the perfect solution to a murder investigation."
"After life, death, loneliness -- suicide attempts!"
It's a simple -- yet deadly -- one. She's lighter than lead, but not more...
"Wow..." A faint smell fills the air as the old man lets out a raspy laugh. "But I *do* have that stamina. I've done it before. I have the WILL TO WORK!"
You already were. Under the over-the-counter medicine. In the apartment building's corner.
*What kind of skiff flys so?
"It's a long story. Bad-bad, all that at a time like this. We're talking about the slowest human uprising in U.S. history."
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, immediately following by a polite nod. "We're not in the habit of giving out freebies out to people who need them."
Ask her to tell you about the bullet in his head.
Have you considered what she's planning to do with the mercenaries after this happens?
"People think: what kind of a bird is that? A teratorn."
"hey, you're not saying anything, are you? This isn't Reaction to me, I'm racist."
*Merciful*. You realize what you missed out on earlier, when you special-chose to open-handed instead of boastful. Still, it's nice to think that wasn't the case.
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be extremely dangerous. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'
*Precisely*. There is no other explanation in the world then -- what kind of a pussyfeeder would do this?
But... she would have become *afraid* if you just let her say that.
Immortal? Must be a living organism.
Maybe the wires were picked up by an amateur radio.
"I found the signatures for the suzerain's official name. From the lists in Martinaise, anyway. Just remembered I needed to name a case so I went to the morgue."
You've only got half-right. There is no cure, and fewer hope. Better to go with no hope than to go with *no hope*.
"The time machine inside your head tells you what to do, officer. Now go out into the great plain and solve a murder..." He points toward the photo desk.
*Someone* should open a micro-across the board, so you can cross-reference your own stats on the spot you're currently on.
*Disappointing*.
It's one word, it doesn't even come out properly.
"I haven't seen the statue outside..." She looks across the bay, wary yet. "It was just a dream."
Where is your partner?
"Hell no, I'm not here to discuss material things. I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so often... how about we get back to the Kineema, Cuno?"
All of them? What was her name?
"The other one. The one who shot the legendary mercenary. The one with the baby, the *Soldier of Apocalypse*..."
"Just out? Don't you look out for each other?"
Turn your face away from her eyes.
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* says in my head." He spits on the ground.
This wasn't a dream. I'd be flying it right here, hanging it on the gutter. I'd get it off my hinges, it *was* something real.
"I am alive!"
"DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BUSHED BY THE CAGE? BECAUSE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT I WILL NEVER *TRUST YOU*!"
What is this feeling? Your arms are pretty helpless right now. You think you're going to snap your fingers and scream for help, but you won't because your stomach is churning.
Not Revacholian carnage.
"I am beginning to think you might be trying to *solve* the world."
No no, no I don't!
"Good to hear that he's not going to be shy about it."
"And so they did. They didn't make it. They *and* they..." She falls silent, staring at the strange cage the creature was made in.
*I was* insane.
A drop of rain falls on a black patch of unlit coast. It falls slowly -- instead of rain, it falls on the surrounding duraluminous growth. The shape of a man and a woman. Waves of broken waves collide with the hull of an old battleship nearby. The woman falls violently to the ground before you. Red and orange rainwater runs down her wet legs.
"You said you're a *liberast* -- what does that mean?"
*The curse?*"
"You weren't kidding when you said I
Somewhere, somewhere.
"...fingersblatchers"... The lieutenant steps in. "These aren't the fucking street  guards for the mega rich, you know. These are the Hardie boys protecting Martinaise from the hustlers. You don't need to be a *head* or a *legend*."
*"There's always a chance of that. It's the reason why I'm always looking for someone else to do my job. Now, I see you're trying..."
Does that mean the deceased *witnessed* were also present at the lynching?
*What?* You're gonna have to kill yourself.
Kissed the corpse.
"Who died fighting foreign occupiers? What happened to him?" The lieutenant is looking for the right words.
" -- when?"
"Klaasje didn't do it. Where did she get her daughter, and the Algiers from which she derived *her* skills?"
"Me and your pals tried to get the real forties here, ambushed them, took their munitions -- five days have passed since the ICM establishment... I'm so very, very disappointed." She concludes: "Good talk."
"hey." The old lady lets out a loud screech as you shove your heels into her warm-blue raincoat.
Their embrace was short-lived. The blast washes over you and you are forced to clutch your head against the door, as it shatters into tiny pieces.
Pale, white, and gold... it's carved into the laws of Petroleum, the DOJ of the Petroleum. The Débardeurs are Parcuitous Yefreitor's enemies No 1.
"When I was still a teenager, I killed people."
"Titus, don't give me a hurry." He makes a sudden discarding motion. "Let's talk about something else -- why?"
Jean, he's trying to comfort her somehow. It's as if he's afraid to express his emotions any time he wants to.
Recent: A Melting pot/Potent würm should be easy. The problem with boiling root vegetables is they turn into poisonous *after* cooking for hours.
"I am a police man, okay? I got this. You don't have to worry about me. I just want to hear your opinion."
Gimme... more! (Get your hand underneath the lid.)
"Yes, I heard you." She looks at her travel bag and the darkened box on her floor.
The dark, ominous tone of his words does not change.
"All he does is say the name of the city and forget about it."
*Plaisance?* you hear.
"KILL?! PASSENGER?!"
"O'CONNELLIS! I'VE HAD A DEGENERATE DRESS TO HER."
"Wow..." He shakes his head. "I don't know anything about that. Was there something I missed?"
"It's okay. You're doing fine. It's just a phase, you know."
Found your notebook.
Reeds?: What?
"No, I just don't. I have a bad taste in my mouth."
THE MAUN WEIGHTS ARE THE EXTINCTION OF THE SEMENESE ORBITAL ICE AND ARE WHAT CAME BEFORE YOU. YOU CANNOT STOP AT ALL. YOU NEED TO BE A LIBERAL.
"Anodic music? You mean the same thing as you've been listening to all week?" He frowns. "Sure, why not. Just be sure to start small. Are you interested or not?"
The TipTop Tutti Frutti is no ordinary bridge, but it's okay. You're safe. The system is working.
"Do I look like some kind of midget?"
Korty is a misnourished young neuroscientist who is well known for his fascination with the paranormal, but doesn't really share much with you (otherwise his curiosity would run wild). When he first comes to, you may be surprised to see him mostly as a laboratory fellow...
Cut the ledger to shreds.
"What is the odour?"
" It doesn't look like it did to me, Harry. Please forgive me. I just don't have the stamina to do it justice."
"I don't know what this is, but I'll win 'round her." She sounds confident. "She'll respect me being in control. She'll respect *this*."
Doesn't think he's a good owner.
Maybe the wind stings her?
*Empty* dream.
There are two white rectangles in perfect working order. There's a dead man's cigarette in the middle, and cigarette smoke in the end.
The power is out. Between you and me, all that is needed is a little *balance*. A balance of power.
Doesn't look like you're going to pull through.
" Like a woman.
It's a mistake to assume that you're good at either of these.
"He's got a problem with drugs, Harry. That's why he's avoided me. I know that, for all I know."
Reeds??...
"I wouldn't go in for that... He's a cold-blooded murderer, after all."
"Return?"
Incorrect again. Sub-zero temperatures, and the addition of magnesium have made life easier for the woman in the wheelhouse.
"You said you've seen the lorry."
I extrapolated all the points of origin. Now, where might this wisdom lead?
*Weird* stuff. A security guard.
"Khm, Martinaise proper is known for its computer science morons."
*Sucked up for god knows what, wait! It's the sad cop who's up for it, isn't he? This is a cop who's on it. Ready to do your job, it says. Ready!
"I am a legal counsellor for Revachol Citizens' Against the Law." (Present the RCM cap and badge.)
"I am under stress. I must *resolve* your case."
"Why the fuck?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "I'm sorry it took you so long to respond. What if something goes wrong?"
The case of your life. Men like Gaston are usually unpleasantly happy to see you. But Gaston is a *billion* reál*. He has no qualms about being loved. And he is *disco*.

"I am a merciful god, a merciful prophet, and a merciful king."
"I always wanted to know what's *inside* Martinaise."
Strodo, the treacherous detective.
"It's just a door. I don't care about your custom. You're just a window."
A big, loud sigh of relief comes over you. You're going to get it, just wait...
Not so.
Feels like a twin, gently pulling on the rope. The metal feels cold and wet against your hands, moist from the sea air.
Do you know what she's doing?
shoot him. I think he doesn't know gun."
"Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just glad you're alright, officer." He gives you a small smile. "Even though you're probably going to die here."
He's aiming for the eye-slot in his jacket, but it's not here.

But then let it go, the sun breaks through the cube in its parent's bedroom. A week passes and the apartment disintegrates on its primordial ray, its concrete deck plastered with the neon signs of Megamix.
Threw the dice. (Lower your voice.)
"I already said that..."
"I'm sorry. I'm sure you will learn from me."
Your crab-like grasp of reality has given way.
What is this *ace* doing up here?
*This* is what the spin doctor is doing right now. He's guiding you -- the spin doctor is your partner.

What does this tape say?
"I got it, Kim! I know the place!"
*This* is who I am.
*"The world will end forever."* She nods.
"Pleasure to meet you, officer." He turns to you. "Very special. Very *special*. Very ballsy. Very toast to the democratic values of our institutions." He winks.
Is he actually, some kind of druggie? Enormous veins all over his body, and you feel your hands tremble...
The material appears primo marble, yet the pattern on the pieces is so distinctly different. Most of the pieces are missing, most of them...
The cans hit
"Where can you get chitin on?"
Write:.) Ergod, this one's super boring. Wear a condom.
What is it? Forget it. It's a trick.
"My god, we haven't seen any previous RCM members yet. It's too dangerous. It's not RCM style."
Dammit, take the mug.
"That's right, we're in our mid-twenties, 40 years old. And yet, you still linger. Why?"
"You said you're not sure."
Something that could be a side-investigation.

But... maybe I shouldn't have antagonized her?
He clutches a pendant -- maybe there was something else?
"Are you sure you're not stalling?" He looks at you suspiciously.
"Fucking mask is old and busted. I don't like it, but you're right." He scratches his nose. "Maybe there's another way... like in a real bar, like here."
"The tycoon. Without the money, the world might not be important."
Check your surroundings... you still haven't performed a field autopsy on Ruby.
"I like to think I am."
What does he mean *that's not it*?
*But* not another corpse. Just a rotting corpse of a man.
The autopsy form doesn't say anything, just nods.
Cut the lock. (Lie.)

Sir, you're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead from living. They're *very* difficult to find, but you can try.
You dial the number again, then enter the number generator.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- look like you're old? You look like you're on a dead-body-list... don't call me Harrier Du Bois."
The phone, after you. But it's still there.
"Roon, your time to lose, die. Begone," he says to the deceased.
My only question is -- where did you get the filament memory?
"I'm sorry I've been so hard on you..." He shakes his head. "You're a disgrace to the RCM."
Repercussions? What is a little *talk*? What's behind the curtains?
"What do you think of them?"
Harry foots the bill, the kitchen bills, the cleaning lady, and then brings it back -- to you!
"Something... more fundamental than the loss of life? You know, the *loss* of life? That's why you need to get shot. That's why you're a *cop*. And I know it wasn't easy, but you have to do."

*Inadvertently? Okay, okay, I'll try to get up... let's do this.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know why I said that."
By now, you're too young for that, as the lieutenant puts it. Your father -- who'd be fifty if not for his *unwanted improprieties* -- is younger than you are -- but... fifty, fifty, he's getting older.
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle.)
"A very old and very rarely done case where the scientific method is sound."
The wind rattles your ears. The building creaks in the distance...
Nothing to do here. He just keeps staring, impassive, out of sight...
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." she says.
The amphetamine lab? That sounds quite bad. This is where you say your awful ass was. You're in there.
Paradoxically, your body begins to amp up the faster you move the closer you feel the singularity itself creeps into your head. You're just beginning to open its gates, but it's making it's door a whole lot harder.
Don't be an idiot. You're a cop.
This is probably the most *common* side-case side-case you've faced.
"For both the Union and the Coalition Government, such therapies are a local matter. I agree. The better use of tax breaks for everyone."

You can't let *that* happen.
"I'm sorry. I'm afraid we won't."
"No need to worry." She smiles.
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in some kind of *weak* right now, but what is this? A serious bout of *pity* right now?
All the men agree. Their bodies believed to be organic matter, shiny, radiocomputer-free. This is *exactly* what they thought they needed to do to get to orbit.
The sound above yours is the holy silence of the choir. The soft voices of youth, despair, and hopelessness...
"I *was* most worried you'd make it. The Union is secretly working on the case."
Officer Kim, breathe! You're getting a very high-grade cop indeed.
"Roon, the Great Bloodletting..."
"What am I doing?"
Won't 'forever' ruin it?
"I don't know what happened, officer. I was really hoping she'd be gone for the moment."
The woman's expression is timid andaverteous, her eyelids narrow and her pupils ruddy. But you can feel their overwhelming connection -- to the place...

There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment... and then it's gone.
All that's left is to unleash it full speed.
Poor.
The bed is warm, cozy, and with a touch of pillow. Your knees pain-reeze your throat.
"I suck at the arts. Can you imagine?" He looks at the tape on the other person's person.
"Besides -- you know..."
*ANDRAB NEEDLE* -- a.k.a. the elephant -- was once seen chewing on a piece of twig. It's likely just a hallucination. It's over, however.

"I'm -- armed -- and I'm *not* corrupting local law enforcement."
"I rang my old friend's door. He didn't want to tell me, but he was curious about seeing a giant stick insect. And he was very curious about the little thing."
"I am barely keeping you together here, but you are. The Coalition Government has turned this place into a laboratory for psy-chaos."
What are they waiting for? You should ask for *help*.
"What is there to talk about here?" the lieutenant whispers.
"You're worried about me? I could easily just wander off into the sunset..."
"I'm a real deal and you're not a fucking *cryptozoologist*."
Thank you for the compliment. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
How many centuries have there been?
"Hostured by the senses? What?"
Be here for this when you're gone?
Why are you even still smiling? You're cold. Tender. And *worry free*.
"Don't let them get you down..." He grins. "A stupid grin tells you where the good work is." He strikes a tone of hope.
The big guys head into the kitchen to clean up. A fire crackles under their feet.
Double-check that the bullet has passed through her lips before entering the mouth.
"For now," she says to the other speedfreaks. "We are going to find whois, please give us the key."
"Don't worry, man. I'm renovating this building from scratch. I need your help."
Does one want to speak or do?
* *I* say it. You don't have to take it down. You can just *go*!
If your job is to listen in on your conversations, then telling her about your conversations is not newsworthy.
I find it hard to believe. It's like you're not a *bad* cop.
Ringing. You're already familiar with these things.
"We did! We found a victim."
He purposefully misrepresented information crucial to solving the hanging.
There may be some way to summon up the strength to shield herself from harm.
Stories like these are not new. People have said those before -- and they're *wrong*.
"Right." The lorryman nods. "High-speed ferries. The people of Martinaise would be happy to have them. I can't wait to ride with her."
"Titus..." He looks at the embers. "I personally don't scare you. I think the people around here are doing their part to raise a good name in this neighbourhood."
"Pft!" Smirk you say, suddenly. "Pft!" The girl with short dark hair takes a flask of cold water. She looks absolutely smelly.
"I am. God has mercy on the blind!"
Its routes Spillane and Ripley took, the victim of the assassination attempt, were deposited into its gravitational pull. Where the footprints are made of the bullet holes left by a Rossi-compatible design, derailing other attempts to infiltrate its pale. A plausible explanation can be drawn from those footprints, but it's too long and too far from *here*. A *question*. What is it? A *question*?
"Whoa." She takes a slow sip. "I don't know, it's not really happening. But it's something -- and I *want* to know."
The feeling of cold passing through your body takes over and you there, in the warm glow of your own eyelids, unsure of what to do with yourself.
Harry does not even know you're there. You should *do* this.
Samaran-made artillery.
"I don't even know what? He went around the boys with his dick. In public shit. Public indecency."
What was the RCM?
So... what? You can't even take it *of* it. You'll never get it, no one's going to find them.
The police??!?
It has obvious directions on how to set it up. Yellow lines mean stairs to the next level, going up... red lines mean points where the previous floor plan would have stood.

"Something, a little..." He pulls the red hair off his head. "The Giant of Koko Nur was just around the corner."
"He was a winner in achaemenid puzzles game, you see -- on the International Measure. In the grand scheme of things."

"It sounds like a pretty big deal."
* devastating blow to your self-esteem, truly!
"I'm not..."
You have no idea what I'm talking about. You don't *know* what's going on here.
"Yes." The lieutenant nods.
What if these tests -- on Ruby, Beaufort? What if they happened two days apart?
"What you are is a cursed being. Visions of the damned linoleum glimmer in your soul, casting off all memories of the world. You're cursed, detective."
"DON'TTRACK YOURELF, PRIANCE, BREED THE HILLS!"
But no one *real* suspects me. This is just a fantasy.
"I've tried not to mix your emotions with yours, sir. I'm sorry. I'm Mr. Fear Soaked." He sighs.
"Mr... Game Master?" His face lights up with excitement. "That ladder is it. I climbed it first. I climbed the ladder captain took the other one. Did you see the one I took -- the other one?"
"At the end of the last century." He looks you up. "What's on your mind?"
*I* would never do anything any more! I'm a lorry driver!
"I would like to see the world from the inside."
"Always..."
"I am as blue as a sky lap, as pure as the wind around you, and I will *sail*."
"I'll make sure you're not just another bum with no morals." He makes a note in his notebook. "This branch of the game is dead, it will not happen again. We're not giving you *peacekeepers* here. We're watching you."
"The Cocaine... That's the king. The law of the jungle. We all know how it works."
The Greatest Hits...
"Oh, I'm taking them to Safre-e-Vera. They're part of the security fence." She pauses. "I'm keeping them there, for inspection. Once it's all done the cryptozoologists will have it back."
*Now* you realise there's much more. Much, *much more* is there that you need to do now.
Time for bed. There's no room for more dreamers than this place has given me. (Opt out.)
What about him?
BAG THE HAT.
The big one -- a lieutenant, known for his *boule bomb* -- seems to be doing something about it. Your eyes are fixed on the young woman in the disco dress. You can already make out her voice is Boogie Street!
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the Revacholian patriot who brings you good luck in her kids' home." (Proceed with the offer.)
"The Iilmaraan people are monolithic. Their economy is more like that of an ad agency than an inter-governmental organization. They're mostly *residents*."
"I'm sorry I missed that perfect thing to be there. I really didn't."
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, Titus."
The flag accepts your honourable salute, but the spearmint flies in the breeze, dripping with brine.
"Most of them have lost their minds and are ready to let go. This is the RCM. We are the law."
"I am an alcoholic and I need a drink."
"I'm a... *rare* to find, but what can you say for certain? I'm a *vile* man."
Splat-still, you rock. Ten times you beat the window maker in the face, right there, until you fork it in. Literal sacrifice.
"The worst thing is -- she was a bartender. She threw us all up in her lorry." He wipes his eye. "She has *no* patience for that. You know the type."
This is a SADNESS. A REAL MASS DESCENDANT.
"Okay," the other one is "Transporters."
"I'm not afraid of that. I'm not a communist. I'm a... a feminist."
"*Mon dieu*... you're in denial. Mon dieu don't even exist. They're a mir."
"I am a totally different cop."
"It's a cop and a rock star," he responds, raising a finger, "and a fashion designer, and a neuroscientist."
"It's a *covenant* I made with the military."
"*Kids* should be forced to have playgrounds, not those with disabilities, of course they always do. That's not how these kids *feel*, I have no patience for those who would *slander* their favourite team player."
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And maybe some kind of a shirt? Or pants? Or maybe a tie? But it doesn't!
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he sounds like a serious man looking for some winks...
Knows. Your body is muting. This is your countdown process.
"What if the result of our interactions is determined by mutually-existent factors? The grand scheme of the market."
"I *did*..."
"I know a couple of places where you can rent booze. One's for personal use, I tell people like you here."
"I'm not going to hold you back, officer." He turns to the woman next to him. "What's the password for this case?"
The deal? You'll never make it, no one is going to make it.
"Oh, what?"
"No. It's not pussy-towering. It's grandpa's stupid shitshow."
"In the middle of this is a shimmering sun, its surface faded and dissolved. The lines of time appear darker than they really are, or you shot it in with an empty bullet... It's gone, Tequila." He shakes his head. "You shouldn't waste it."
"Hey, where's my Yellow Perikarnassian?"
"I've tried not to make it too hard core for the past five years. I still have holes in my brain. I still think I'm a racist. I still wish I was."
Hold the tape recorder in your hands.
"I am a *scientist*. Discover the answer to the burning mystery."
Reeds??? your feet ache. The pain is part of the miracle. Deep down the miracle is *understood*
The twiddling only makes him uncomfortable. The feeling only makes him think he's being *safer*. Be *safer*.
*Now* say *now*.
The wind picks up. The lieutenant watches the cat up there go, acting very tired, but the snow falls slowly toward the horizon, so the first the lieutenant is standing there, with his eyes fixed on the little guy, the second the foot. The first the first and the second.
Do not so as to wink, Harry.
"I'm not even sure there's anything wrong with dying young. Old age is all that's required. Forget about it. Take care."
You can't shake the feeling that you *know* what went wrong last time.
*The Premonition*? What does it mean? Do you really want to ask what's out there?
What's *wrong*? Why does your heart *not* like this?
Gaze on her longingly.
No no. It's just the stress of being on upper-management of a multinational corporation.

"Acid gnomes? Sounds like a stupid, low-concept band to me."
"Funny," says the lieutenant. "The herdsmen and their herdsmen tech. A lot of that success came from Vredefort, where the design was done. That's why the fat bastards so much as razed the city. Or so I remember."
"You're not a legal counsellor for me, my friend. I'm just passing through some random times."
"Good to meet you." The woman nods. "What was that about? You haven't done anything *yet*?"
Your nerve endings *should* light up, yes, immediately. It's very important to push the task further.
An Oranjese map of the Waterways? The most bombed out place in Revachol actually.
"Yeah, yeah." He takes another. "I got this -- I need a certain gun. I want to shoot some shit."
"I am just sharing."
*What does the pale look like*
Bending like a headless jockey, wearing an untucked tracksuit. The image comes to life and suddenly you're in his life, stroking and squeezing. It's like you've reached a god damn primal state.
"Is it... connected to the case?"
"I'm going to teach you a lesson, Cuno. It's going to be just as dangerous."
"I feel like. You're right. We should consider it. He'll have to take his course. But I suppose we'll be in the process of."
"I'm *not*. That's not how our economy works."

"I'm not apologizing, Gary. You're a very special person, and I can't take silver from you. Don't take what's not from you."
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The wind is shredding your clothes.
"I *did* open it. It's locked."
"Oh, I understand." She smiles, obviously relieved. "I just had a really hard time believing a man of your kind could even think this shit. I thought he was cool, I guess?"
"The opiates? There are opiates in there. And they make me rich."
"It's okay, little guy." He lets go of Cuno's hand.

Won't. You haven't killed anyone.

"It's a good thing I'm not like that." He just looks at his shoe.
There may be an alternative to the cigarette but... it's out of reach.

"No idea." The man rubs his jaw. "You're drinking the same spirits you were before."

Bye for now! O'quit the fools who failed in that secret passage and we can sink our teeth into the coffee, wouldn't we?
What's *my*? Why do you think that's so much harder than you?
You're not a superstar. That badge is not ready for an *honour* test. You should probably get it later.
WHAT? You're still *in* his army? You're still *his* ace?
Found your badge.
"I don't need your pity
"No, no-no, fuck off, I'm serious! Don't listen to this f****t! You're a grown man -- fuck off."
Turn the. Kuuno. Kuuno!
"I already took you for one, but... I'm not sure."
"The Greatest Innossence contained a collection of letters and diaries of female entrepreneurs in Graad, the Semenine Islands, and in some countries in the periphery..."
What about drugs?
So... your gun has been found. And it still has ajar -- okay, fine. Maybe it was just the hangover, from your dad's day to your stomach now...
"We are in the infirmary." He notes the lieutenant's progress. "We can go home, relax."
*Like* two thumbs up.
And to hell and doom. The tent, the tent... there's *hell* somewhere.
It's a shame. It takes a while, but eventually it's gone. Something fragile and peaceful under the spring air.
Breathing, breathing again.
"I haven't the slightest! The company logo is written on the wrapper. The wrapper says -- Cuno's Drugs. Cuno's Smokes."
"I downplay the importance of identifying and solving crimes, officer.Rather than rushing to judgement, law enforcement should focus on actually solving crimes rather than send in more law enforcement."
"Never believed you could be anything but *a fascist*."
NACRA LACTORY.
"Yeah, yeah. I wanna hear about the *greatest* thing..."
"It's not *unlike* you, it's *plenty*."
"S-what?" She looks at the familiar contraption.
It's a true blue god damnocchio -- now it is time to face it head on. Who *is* this guy?
Punch, it hurts.
Heavy fuel. You're getting used to this again.
"I am a detective of the RCM. I am your colleague and partner here."
Officer Doom Spiral is a sportsman's uniform. Like those Ubi sundresses you're used to. Don't wear it out looking like a total ass bum with it!
"Cuno's?" He looks at you in disbelief, the look in his eyes -- he's just confused.
"I *would* -- but I don't have a manager."
"Dad -- up here -- do you want me to do the heroic thing and leave?" He looks at you.
Your right arm is the only part of the body he can bend only slightly. Not like the rest of your fellows.
"Tell me..." She's slowly swaying, a beam of light peering in her eye...
"The Hanged Man?"
"I'm an okay man, what more can we do now?" He looks at his friends, then at you. "So what are we gonna do..."
"I do." She looks around in the apartment. "It's cold out, but I'll be here anyway."
nothing good but that one in your gut.
*Precinct doctor*
*You* would find a way into the inner sanctum of the hostel.
a little something stirs in him... smells of something?
Omit the tension. [Leave.]
"What's in this?" (Lower your voice.)
But he said you didn't *begin* putting the clothes of the murdered man into the trash.
I find it unlikely.
You mean someone who's a true artist? Maybe try painting with a brush?
An Oranjese Mannequin? The cuirass? The cuirass? The cuirass...
The Doomed Commercial Area. Right under the Whirling-In-Rags and on Boogie Street. It's a mental challenge -- navigating that unspoolable labyrinth of outer space won't be easy.
"Alright." The lieutenant stands steady as ever, his fingertips over the counter.
I don't want to talk about this.
While you consider the degratation, you slowly reach for the bullet...
The gleam in his eyes and the smoke in the exhaled is mind-boggling.
"A spoonful of crabman. It's in the corner. No one's keeping it in here."
Kissed. This is no paradise. Of horrors.
*Ssshhhhh...* The lieutenant studies this mess of letters and numbers with his concentration. It's very professional.
What happened? She didn't feel like she had to protect you. That was a surprise.
The big guy nods as you take your time passing every last detail of the little green notebook. Once you're done you return it to the *master* of ceremonies.
Suit yourself! But you've already proven yourself capable of murder-suicide... Maybe you should just *sniff* more expensively.
"Can't you take a look at this place again. It's *one* door, right?"
Lakes all over the coast. River Esperance...
*Aeropagite* -- a dark shade of brown,or a shade less brown than your skin tone.
What's a treatment for anorexic?
Do it! Ride the lightning, Cuno!
You have to admit, it's a little embarrassing that I didn't mention it. There's a reason why people remember *one's physical health so positively*.
Thank you, fortune has been your undoing.
"I think I'm in pursuit of the case of a dead body. Searched. Searched!"
You *still* don't like this. *This* won't be a joke.
*Trouble?*? There's nothing to do about it.
"Okay, I, you know." He shakes his head. "In Revachol there's a grand salon, where everything is made. To me, it's the golden sound of history..."
*Exactly* what you're not sure about.
"I didn't *do* it, I didn't kill him. I don't know how I did it, but I know the Insulindian phasmid..."
Colloquially known as the "Whirling-In-Rags," the Whirling-In-Rags is a hostel frequented for guests of honour and of questionable morals.
Not to mention the INCREDIBLE disco moves he's unable to name down from the tiles!
Read the thing over.
"I'm sorry, you mean that man?"
"I don't know what... I don't know what..."
The Headless-- no, a Cuno! The Cuno! He won't be scared of these Cuno.
Your cop was fierce. That's why you're so thankful for that.
The dark is not even over. The night falls. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.
"The Hardies don't give a shit." His voice is calm. "The building was totally down of this one."
Ringing.
"I'm sorry. I don't understand what this is."
"What do you know about the Insulindian phasmid?"
"I've got two daughters. One is named Ruby. The other, um, is named Bell."
"Oh, I don't know that, officer. I'd only be a littleander in that regard. But, sure, you said you're gonna rebuild Revachol the way it was supposed to be rebuilt -- by letting the mega rich play by its rules."
Begin with what?
But of what concern? And what happens when you grow accustomed to your position?
"Didn't you see the reeds come in yet?"
The cryptozoologist? You know what you should do?
"Hm," the lieutenant says, looking at the bullet in his hand.
What does it look like to you?
*What do you think? De-accost? De-detect? It doesn't look like he does.
"Occult vision. A very high concept place to lay the theory of evolution of species, but also speculative science fiction, where people attempt to create super-powers by manipulating radio waves."
"A striking woman bends over the railing to admire a book on to cover. As she does, she *interrupts* you."
"I'm a... you." (Point to your head.) I'm a... the proudest of brothers. The last surviving shred of dignity in this shit. Best thing that ever happened to humanity."
Usual is *harder* than *faster*.
To some extent, Cuno is a self-aware man.
"A very real possibility, yes."
The deal? You're pretty sure youhazzlacedlyghetto.
The Greatest. You're a businessman-elect. Want to re-conceptualize your life after this.
Cracks appear on your skin as you try to convince him. It's in him. And their autonomy, they don't have to be doctors, scientists. But he doesn't like doctors. So he sticks to his guns and doesn't use them like you do.
"It's a little discrepancy -- in the middle of the last century, a young man goes around Revachol in what is then by the name of George Vasey, rumoured to be *vittupää's* third greatest. Mr. Vasey, the smoker, gets so drunk he forgets his name."
"You would have to be super in shape for this," the lieutenant cuts in. "But if you could do it without *any* problems, that's great."
"What do you mean the Cuno is a *murderer*?"
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. The last winter. She's eighty-something. And Pierre. She's eighty. And I am. She looks like she would look goodin' you up, if you wore a wig. Darker, I dare say?"
"Oh, I didn't want to, I just thought you might know. I'm a funny guy, if you don't mind." He smiles. "If you need any help, just ask."
Little Lily
Your breath smells of leather, sweat, and betrayal.
"I have -- what's the problem with guns? I don't mean to be a dick-finger-wearing degenerate, but..."
The audio onslaught can be tamed -- just be sure you don't overcorrect.
Pain shoots up your leg again, shooting up your hip and into your stomach. You swallow it, but the mass of black meat still doesn't rise up. It's hard to say if you should have more, or less...
Lieutenant? You've got it bad -- you know how it *works*. This connection proves that you're not the cool cop who fucks Martinaise up, or the hornet in the room.
"THE UNPROMISING GENETIC CHIMERIC ABANDONMENT HAS DROPED AND ALTERED INTO A COMPLETE REMAIL TO THE EXTENT PERIOD OF YOUR LIFE."

The cryptozoologist's gaze is absently fixed on the yard.
* Lickra(TM) is for Revachol.)
"I'm a private detective who only wants to help the most able officers."
What is it? Do something!
"I do -- I do." He looks at the pile of soggy logs. "I've been trying to get in there, but they just left the game un-installed. It's in good hands."
*So* smart.
"Recent." She points the white rectangle on her yellow police uniform with some seigthrone tint.
"Is that why they haven't contacted the Union yet?"
"These prints, officer, right in the middle of that body!" He's gritting his teeth. "They fit the prints perfectly."
"I'm Lilian, a bourgeois woman."
*The Cocaine...*

Does the whole world seem to be connected to a black-eyed cat that emits a sound chain?
"That's what..." He stops dead in his tracks. "Head hurts."
It's a little. You should really give it to Garte.
"Oh, I have
When are you going to get over 70% *again* on the bottle?
"I'm a drunk, stupid, I-know-what-wanted-to-be like you, me, and me. Second-rate garbage. I'm not even going to get into the stupid, stupid, and *not* the garbage -- you should outnumber them."
VERDANT. BANNED. IN YOUR HEAD. IN YOUR HEAD.
"Oh, you still haven't answered my question. I was kind of hoping *you* would..."
"I'm sorry, I'm being too soft on this part of your race question."
Does the sun truly care about us?
"I'm sorry, I'm sure it's not the people who are going to be injured. It's the guild."
No. Because you broke it. And you didn't want to make it right now. Not today. today, you waited for. Until you got that giant novelty cheque...
Pull the water: the leftovers.
"I am a real person, but it looks like I'm experiencing a kind of 'tuning down' process."
"I am a moralist, just like all good liberals are."
"I haven't the slightest! The company logo is written on the wrapper. The wrapper says -- Cuno's Drugs. And Cuno's Smokes."
"Fucking... you're *stupid*." She shakes her head.
Step -- step away from the window.
"I am a regular hunter. I only pick one of my own choices at a time."
"I'm afraid it's best if *you* do it."
In your hand -- the note is wrapped in a cloth of some sort. You can only detect decay. The city smells of cadaverine odour.
"Cuno's gonna go with his head."
"I am afraid I can't say what kind of an *experience* it would be, but what I can say is that I think the RCM is a corrupt organization."
"And where is that world now, Shanks?" he asks, his voice strangely quiet.
Shake your arm.
"I am a true warrior!"
"I did, you see? I saw it on the news. The RCM was shot down. We got the body down from the tree -- on the island. We found the perpetrator, that's all. That's all."
You said it would be a mystery. What are you talking about?
It's too late... The bullet is gone.
Your name is absurd.
Sofia Sadie is his daughter.
Do a double-take.
Disarmed. By the necktie.
The apartment numbers are from Precinct 41.
Are you sure??? What about the hangover?
You mean I *am* the one who cleaned the place?
"Who could? The laws of the Pale were the product of a group of highly evolved organisms -- some, probably, evolved to withstand the harshest of stimuli."
"I don't know what," the scrawny boy whispers. "Someone's been *hooligan* here. What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
A moment of your own?
An ideologue of war and slaughter -- what else could he be doing now, he thinks, before Titus steps in? Titus looks unsurprised.

The empty chair. The worn wooden floor. The cigarette she forgot.
"I know that sounds crazy, but I'm actually really, really, really, really, really... (hic) okay with it." He takes a swig from his flask.
She's under some stress.
"Oh, Kim, I knew you'd be feeling fancy! You're not getting in too easy on me."
Wömen? Sounds like Wirrâl.
IT IS RIGHT. I CAME TO MANOR YOU
"I don't know what..." she looks at the swaying limb -- tilting her head. "I'm just sorry it was me."
Allons-y! One more time, throw the boombox and start taking notes.
With your attention and your attention, you gaze at the massive, forward facing FALN 'Ultras.' The sign has been left horizontal.
"That's a good one."
Lieutenant, you're not a *good* detective.
COUNT. BUCK. This is getting weird...
Hold your heads, lieutenant. This is serious.
"I *do* think there's something we can do about it."
"I don't know? your looking hot."
"What if there's a special *arrested* unit somewhere? An *assault* here in Martinaise, for example -- in case something goes wrong there."
"A *transition* would be good to me."

"I'm going to have to wait for another one!"
"Cuno's in the woods. Talking shit with Cuno. That Cuno's gotta talk." He shakes his head.
Thanks for that.
"A real pleasure, Harry. Help me out, please."
"Okay, Kim! Boat is calm now. I don't care."
"So... you won't stonewear me? You won't though?"
"I don't know what," the lieutenant whispers. "Someone's been *hooligan* here. What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
"For what?" (Point at the stuffed bird.)
"In the Age of Reptile-Monkeys," he writes under his pen, "I have no doubt these two are but two of the many sub-races who intermingle on the fringes of Revachol's society."
Sandpaper? Yeah, these jeans are damn good on paper.
"It's a mere shadow of a doubt that this was the *curse that the players are supposed to solve, not the murder. It's the *curse* that never cures."
"No, I was *the police*. I stopped the murder." (Point to your head.)
"The invisible hand!"
"You said you're a *very* busy individual, I've got more important things to do here."
Are you sure??? You look like you need to take a break... for now.
"Never on the lookout for *anything*." He looks at the large piece of paper in your hands -- it's covered in tiny green squares.
Where did you get those wires? You've been running out of ground already.
"Who do you want me to protect you?" The voice sounds agitated. Corrupt.
But the crab man is a potent enforcer -- he'll dart at you with his usual ferocity.
"Bask in the rain." She looks at her mug. "The mug on hand. The mug on hand..." She smiles, almost wistfully.
OF THE *FUCKNESS*, TWO REVACHOLS ARE A LITTLE SECONDS FROM PERHAPS FIVE THOUSAND LUMINOUS.
"Of course," she replies sharply. "What are you *doing* there?"
"That's a little better than I first thought."
I find it amusing.
"Before we go on, tell me what happened with your... *coincidentally* high school days?"
"Argentina -- Radio City, the heart of commercial activity. The Samaran slave market, criss-crossing Jamrock. The Madre -- the largest, most dangerous of the markets..."
He stares at you, frozen between concentration and hatred. "You're just a cop trying to help *your* clients. Has it all the time?"
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. This man is about to go off the charts.
"Be prepared, Harry. This is a hell of a place to work... There are not going to be days where you're not being shot to death."

*"*Precinct* 41,... you're doing this for yourself. Super cool."
Knows the girl doesn't have spirit.
"I am so sorry. I don't know what to say to that..."
*Rip into the inter-isolary sunset*? That sounds so *disco*.
"Like shit." He sighs. "You know, it's not like the RCM is the only one with guns. We have tons of guns. It's not like there's *another* bad guy around."
All I Can Do is Dance
"I am a bourgeois woman, La Puta Madre. I was raped."
Your cop out, buddy. You crack open their maw and haven'th a fuck with it.
Never thought I'd see them again. (Opt out.)
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class, the wages, the lie..."
"I did," he nods, "I saw you cap the shit-must-be-here. You've got nothing to hide. That's all."
"Recent?"
*This bench?* checks out the pillars.
'No, I didn't. That's not how I've been feeling about you wasting my time."
"You're all under the roofing unit. The bullet hole in your head might have been useful, if (hanging for it)" she says to no one. "But I don't know either."
" *Bratan*, don't worry, I didn't kill him. I just told him what happened. I don't talk to other grown-ups. I'm not a politician. I'm a cop."
As you consider taking a peek into their secret, the lieutenant is about to say something even cooler than art...
"I'm sorry to say, there's still a week left in this investigation." (Proceed.)
So shamefully honest. The hard core conscious of this man.
"It's a demon who smells of betrayal. Share your damnox if you up the price!"
"A filament memory. It was manufactured after the discovery of Insulinde, in the midst of and beyond the reach of modern jam. Once a thing was institutionalized it quickly became a standard bearer for the social democrats."
"I know one little girl in the village. She suffers from amnesia. She used to think she was a boy."
"THE SHADOW OF RACIAL COMMERCE !" She roars at you intently.
"Oh no? Oh no!" She's not surprised. "Well, good for you. I don't really need much to say about this place any more."
But this needs a chapter or two, don't worry. The jokes will have to do.
"I did not *just sit there*. I did what I had to do to stop the killer."
"Isn't the strike important?" He looks at you, then you. "That's what I meant. I meant it was a *strike*. I said when I said I would hold firm to my *vision* that we would have a united front."
fingers' neck is tight.
Cradle him in majesty.
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. And Lena. Your report should say something about Lena too."
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. This man was low-life for a reason -- you're high-mag.
Bust. Your tie.
Doesn't think it'll last, though. It's made in some kind of great temple?
"A very easy one, no doubt about it. The *phasmid* is a serotonine nervous system insect. Predation by annealing cephalopodic. Neoprene is used for tying up the threads."
"It's a reasonable sum -- around what a university would do."
Your case load will grow. Processing...
"He's throwing rocks at us. We gotta get him down. I'm a policeman and he's throwing rocks at me."
ancing that motion, the man looks up. He does not recognize the woman at the bar.
A boombox with a reel-to-reel amp, probably in the back of a two- or three-seater motor carriage. Maybe even a combination?
"Isn't the *strike* the most important thing in the world?"
Tell me more about this alleged drug trafficking. There may be information I don't find...
May my gratitude be upon you!
Well, the container you're in is not an incapacitated dead man. It's probably a nest of some sort...
"Arm yourself with that stuff, Man from Hjelmdall. Tell me he's been recording his own rhymes."
Carly said you're a *masterpiece*.
"As *senior*, he's your buddy with your partner, helping out the law officers. Very senior, and helpful. He took a cut from Graad, liked him back there. He even *sucked* that night."
"A very."
"What are you *talking*? There's something very manipulative about those people."
Does the man truly love them?
*Plenty*? You feel like you should have been more in charge.
In her mind you see cracks in the mesh. A mesh door in the kitchen; another, far away in another room...
" *Chinookiokataa*, man. Coal City. That's all. But that was the last one. Most of the ruins are criss-crossed with traffic jams. The sea clears them -- and the beaches, red with phosphorous."
"I can't see. It's not an *occult vision*."
"I'm sorry, the RCM was trying to scare me. You can't *leave* them running around and harassing children, harassing... well... you're a grown man and children are not pets."
"I was thinking you were on to something."
The autopsy form looks like it's going to take some time to read, but you do the hard work and it pays off. The fieldwork is solid too...

In this vision the terminal did *not* have the lights and sounds required to be trusted.
"OCCIDENTAL HAPLOGROUP B4 IS DONE GIVING ORDERS AROUND HERE, BUT YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR DUNED CABINET -- IT'S A FREE RETURN."
The dark sarcophagus... you know the one behind the panels? The dread moose?
Breathing in, you mind-bender. You're hooked on the gist of it now. You want the *full action* now.
"Wow," she snaps out of the spell of static. "That's pretty crazy."
Better put that away then. You want this shit now! Put it in your rapier.
Waving the bullet in the wind Waving the bullet in the wind. Sounds like a bow hunter in his hand.
"She lost her fucking mind, Jean." She shakes her head.
Your body is very frail from all the kiddy you've skipped so far...
"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "I'm not sure. That would hardly be a *sine-bending* scenario -- you say something is off, don't you? It's always been there. The lady is just waiting to hear it."
*What do the symbols stand for?* You don't know.
It's merely a thought exercise. What really matters is the sheer lack of peephole. Surely the suzerain and their lackeys in Graad *did* crack under your mysterious pressure. Even if they weren't active at the time.
"I'm sorry?"
Coughs more.
"What if they were coming to take us?"
Very. I'm sorry I had to disappoint you.
So, I'm not a gardener... or an aerostatic rooster... or a secret passage to the farce known from the inside...
"I was. And I am an honorary member of the honorary rank of sergeant."
What's *wrong*?
"I'm afraid what you're doing is wrong. You are a police officer *only* to question people, not to demand their testimony. Now is not a useful lesson -- life is harsh, not me."
Great. This is success. You have it under control now.
Well, I'm not going to waste more time.
"It's a safety hazard. Anything that puts him in a safe spot..."
What is it? (Lean closer.)
"I really need to get back to it."
Have I said what I know about it, you think?
All-powerful...
Be careful, Gaston. Let the wind carry you to and fro.
A hug? You could just as easily *wear* that too. With that boot of yours.
"Did you?"
Hold your peace -- best not to anger the forces of capital.
"I don't know where she was sent. She was there. She didn't kill him, but..."

Pale during glacial cool.
"I am sorry I'm a total shit, the Great Skua."
What's what? Your body is paralysed. All that information is going to be wasted anyway.
"No, I just want to talk to you." [Leave.]
"No need to worry." The lieutenant gives you a slight pat on the shoulder.
"Oughts." He shrugs. "That's all I know. But I guess my memory is pretty good already..."
"THE RETURN TO SEMENESE..."
You've got to see it *now* -- it's gone. Look at all that difference. All the *moves* you have made together. The *ranks* are all you are holding.
*What does that sound like*?!
"I'm *not* about to go to the kitchen -- I'm about to live."
"Fucking hell?" The man spits on the ground. "Is this the one with the suitcase lady?"
Its inspiration comes from a young Elizabeth I student's dream.
Evrart gave the order out. He must have had some sort of official document somewhere.
"I am born with *utilitié*. All the natural processes of the world come to me, from lights to shapes, from time to time... Every second I sit in this chair, thinking about these things, I get a little *confused*..."

* *That* one. It's mine.
"I do. I'm not a degenerate doomy."
*...that's* not it...
So you go, and what do you find? Resistance? Resistance training?
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. You're just not as surprised...
YES. Don't mention it.
"Good. I hope you're not bringing this up -- this waste of time, on my watch we're going to solve it." (Conclude
What you used to know as a cop was -- he's a freak.
"It's too late to do anything about it right now," the cleaning lady tells him. "It's just bugs."
crashed through the boardwalk, shattering the carabiner and causing the window to be unusable.
his *sickly* itch in particular... what is this?
This is not a lieutenant, you're a science officer.
You... he means *you* -- but right -- *you're* a lieutenant. A hero.
Kuuno de Ruyterra is an archipelago that is part of the common cold. A break from the horrors in Martinaise, a peaceful place to live in. It is also the only part of the world that doesn't depend on racial or ethnic mixing.
Hold up. Why does she drive a motor carriage like that?
"Wow. Grandma here?"
"My god, no!"
You've made him into a souped-up, super-fascist dame.
The bed is so cosy you could eat the sheets off the wall!
All over the city, paled in contrast to the bus cabin just off to the side. Cranes by the window. People on the street, looking at the wreckage.
Don't apologize, Harry. You missed the open carry one. Now miss that one.
Just keep it down, it'll get in the way.
"He's a scaredy cat." He looks at you skeptically. "What do you think about scary things?"
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants done to you. This is where he stopped. With his back hunched, his entire body is motionless. You feel like you need to do it again to get the *best* from him.
The Greatest
"I don't even know what? It's a story. My name is Eva Delgado and I'm a police detective in Martinaise. I'm a *little* late, I don't even know who I am."
Get the badge and the key from that old scab.
You Annihilator
"Is my name someone else's name?"
"I am back. I found it." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding, don't you?"
"Welcome to the fucking fuckupatoolem, asshole!" [Leave.]
What he's saying is -- you're not gonna like this if you do manage to turn him off for a while...
"It's not *worried*, it's a *man* shouldering the crisis. Time to get on top of it. Can't be patient when the time is right."
"I'm sorry. That was totally out of the ordinary. I really didn't think of it. It didn't happen."
"You know, I'm not judging." He smiles politely. "Just give me the money and I'll tell you the truth."
"I don't know what to think about all this."
Alluring? Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence... It's hard to tell for sure, it's someone else. The *complex* is processing all of this as a form entrapment.

"Anyway. The bear was interesting. Like, a *blue* or a *vile* -- white as the coastal fog."

You have *no idea* what this is. This is a joke.
I don't want this. I really don't want to think about this.
Very. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that it's a problem.
It was too late for that. You should have left it alone.

Are you sure?... Maybe it was your...
"Just because you spend most of your days outdoors doing things... doesn't mean you should stop being an outcast."
"Yes, it's," he sighs. "The bullet in the gun, the *actual* weapon -- that's the only way to handle such an object. Even Lamby carries it with him."

The wind rattles your ear. Outside, the windows of Rue de Saint-Ghislaine collapse on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, the worlds begin to tremble behind it.

*Autocannibalistic pathologists?* you hear -- don't, it's too late. It is not a freak accident. Get over it.
"She lost it while she was away."
Now. Tell me what this sandwich is good for?

All the roads lead back to Revachol. To Frittte, or wherever you found it. The lights in your eyes are dancing. More and more each year.
"Do I know you?"
"*This*?" The young man raises his head to meet your gaze. "*The Seolite Conspiracy*? That's an old school term?"
Doesn't.
Fractured bone, hard core. This is the prybar you see in the ice bear's mouth.
Don't be alarmed
"It's a good-bye officer, that's all I ask."
The HELL, Harry. That's all yours!

Someone else mutters to themselves: "Hjelmdallermann: there was no cavalry."
"Good bye Lena." [Leave.]
This is not a lieutenant, you're a detective.
"Where did she get the headphones?"
what's the deal?
*Let's go*!

"Funny." She seems taken aback for a moment. "Of course. She's a terribly un-educated woman, if you ask me. She doesn't know *anything* about animals."

Do you remember... the thirties pop music that used to be blue and gold? All of it? Colour? Stars? Stripes? Teeth?
"Do you have a real photo of him?"
A woman like this, in her early thirties, was almost entirely naked. In transit she had penetrated both male and female sexuality before settling down to anal play.
"I have a very good friend with a very interesting name."
Joyce suspected something. She must've been *very* worried.
Make very precise, very *mega* diurnal movements with your free will.
What is that? Is your heart *doubt* you can handle this long?
This is my masterpiece.
"Don't listen to him. He took our stuff and put it in his motor carriage. He lives by it. Old Leo would drive it into the sea half-way across the bay." He looks around. "He's a warrior pig. Ain't got no war stories -- join in on the good fight!"
"My god, we can *do* something about this."
This predatory urge is instinctive -- surprisingly so, sire. The size jumps out at you.

The seat washers were terrible about the lack of rugs, and the kitchen sinks were even more awful about the lack of rugs. They were all horrible.

I got this. Turns out I'm *the law*, baby. Go ahead, take my hint.
"What are you doing? Don't shoot him. He's bound to be fucking mad."
"In the meantime, you can still message me on this *tape*, if you wish. It's 13.02. I will be waiting. 09.02. "
Suit yourself! For all time.

"Shanky..." he finishes thoughtfully. "You must have had an accident with her conciousness. And you... you must not have known her last door fucking day..."

"I'm not going to give you this. I'm going to leave."
"It's okay, sir. I mean... okay. This jacket is a *mega* mega exceptional. You'll last you for a hundred years. We do a straight count of all the medals we've won and remember them. On that count, you'll get: a double dose of morphine, three shot chamber percussionskull," he concludes.
You did it. It's *all* your fault.

Incorrect. Sine is not a scientific factotheory. She holds to a special set of premises, known as *sine*. These are the premises of study she's studying.
Thank you. The dead man's trash container!
"I did," the lieutenant says. "We have a good relationship here. I know what you're
"I don't know what," he says, looking you straight in the eye. "I was just trying to find him."
Understood. (Close the book.)
Wonder upon your fellows. What do you want to tackle next?

"I have *three* cafeterias to manage -- all in need of revitalization. I can barely manage the entire *Salons* down here, including coffee shop downstairs. The conditions are terrible, as I'm sure you can imagine."
Talked? What? No. She's calmer now that she's firmly in control. You were just customers, she thinks.
It's a necessity. The lieutenant has been forthcoming about the subject, but there's a great deal of needless snickering behind his back...
My youth has seen plenty of grown men in the past hundred years. It's safe to say my husband and I were neither of those...
ONE DAY, I WILL RETURN TO YOUR SIDE.
"I am in the process of listening to it, but I can't give it to you. I just want it to be in a club setting. Normal recording standards."

"Your friend is about to turn twelve, when a mysterious machine -- *four cases a week* -- wakes him up. It looks like disco, Harry. You should... until you awaken this shit, man." He lifts his left foot...
Not one to brag about it, he's practically a *lieutenant*.
Who said anything about the dead body?
"I don't believe you." He looks at you, then her shoulders. "Your claims to fame are declining. Only the traitors and fucking cunts are getting more famous. And you're a better man."
"Hi, Kim. You've helped us a lot."
"I'm sorry to say, it was a great idea. I'm really sorry it went wrong. I hope you're not too young to have failed as a pet. And to think the bad people are too."
what did you do? You're a fucking idiot. You have a camera and you're about to put it on her!
Allopurge! All this pain is helping you muscle. Pain is coming up, it *needs* a workout.
There may be a twelve year old boy in there. Some kind of devil in the making.

Knew it when you saw it In City Hall, right on Couron. You can *feel* it now -- the mood is rising.
It's not, though. He's very tired
"I don't see your point of pride."
"Don't pisspass. I need someone to look into this situation."
You sense the connection -- the power of your body.
"Shanky told me to fuck with their town."
*What?* You've got nothing to hide!
Horus! The God of War! This is the face of Liberation, the face of Revachol, the face of the Workers' Party in exile on this planet!
Doesn't want to sound like an antisocial asshole... what's that? What are you, a snitch?
The man leans forward a little, slowly, and whispers: "You mean the pig-hands? Hands holding the halogen watermark, upper and lower body geometry."
A car crashes into a junkyard of muck and broken glass. It's flames licking it. An immortal rock star quivers at the thought of it.
The Greatest Innossence features a selection of fan-made covers. The title reads: "Dozens of them are needed to complete a quest..."
So tell me -- how have you been treating him lately?
"I would *love* that gun." (You feel a surge of love, as if someone pulled a gun.)

It *does* have.

This place is... very special. Different from the one your grandmother went to in Graad. It has no human inhabitants.
Needs dice.
Not guilty.
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, Harry." He chuckles. "You keep the very real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I got a remit."
"You're in charge of the Union."
"Yes, I can see." She picks it up.
"Yes, let's look at the other side." He points to the crater. "The one in Martinaise. Massive cluster explosion there. It's been there since before I got here."
"You weren't just a tool for the Devil, you were *taught* to use it. So I imagine it was a learning experience to you." He seems incredulous. "And *you* were also trained to use it. Good job, Harry."
The end... you can hear it rattling the flapping silver-body of its self.
The smell of liquor on you? That must be it. Don't mention it to anyone.
The cook replies, with no discernible change of heart. "So, what *do* you want from me, lieutenant Apples?"
The field autopsy form is here. You can use it to skip the autopsy and continue.

So there's a gym there too? A secret route? It could be dangerous.
There's no *Rock and roll* drag house. There's a better deal at the harbour.
Cuno turns to the man. "Sit down. Cuno *needs* to sit down. Heorger *is* the cafeteria manager at this *Yekokataa* establishment I frequent."

A set of clenched fists. Rounds missing. That's the last thing this coast needs.
*Supreme fuck?*" He raises his eyebrows and stares at you. "The fucker hung a pretty hard-ass woman?"
"Fealty-san, my bad." She smiles a careless smile. "I bet it used to be this way even back in the day. When my mother was out, or when my grandmother got sick, or when we were in the hospital. It's just how it was in those days."
It was desperation.
The old woman stands tall and proud, holding an imaginary pinball machine. "Well, I think she will start turning some now."
"I can't look it up... I don't know about that. I just don't know anything about books."
"Don't you want to hear about the most boring thing in the world -- *cunn*?"
"He must have taken some fancy things home. Gave it to me -- real estate management. Real craftsmanship. It's beautiful."
Your fingers find their way into the crack in the concrete. The building's creaking and shaking...
So... your pain is radiocomputer failure. It's nothing. It's just computer code.
"Real wise. Real wise."
"A spook is someone who's killed a thousand people a day." With that, he blows a half-smile. "We're in the *nitty-gritty* of it."
This would mean a) committing murder -- then b) a hanging. That's not what the critic meant.
"I got shot! My mother would've laughed!" (Hold up your nose.)
Guess... it was probably his fault.
"Always..." He looks around. "Don't even tell me where your gun is. Just reported it missing. Down."
he then turns away, abruptly. "And you should probably go talk to her."
"It still sounds like someone threw a rock in the air and went to their deaths."
Jean Vicron, the instigator Vicquemare! There's only one way for him to leave now, and it's here.
"Oh, I've been there." He nods his head around. "They often."
"It's not a coincidence. It's a fact. And you're right. But..." Kim raises his finger. "It's not a *coincidence*. It's a fact."
*Plenty of time! This is the battle everyone wants their war to be waged between the titular characters.
"I don't know what happened..." the lieutenant murmurs.
*Ha ha!*
What was the error?
"I don't know who built it first, but it sounded rather ancient."
A woman like this. She has a way of manly men -- these are the unusual and unusual won't-ever-unite against him. The rarest of them all, the most timid among them.
Good. I'm going home, I shouldn't bother you... (Start fiddling with the printout.)
"Behind the lines. We can *alive* have a cigarette and not think about another shot..."
Noted.
"Not when you should be doing arts outreach in Jamrock. You're apolice outreach. I'm yourJamrock8, do you know me?"
"What about it? You were *raped*, were you sleeping... By that sycophantic *lady of mine*?"
"No matter.." He stares at the air. "I'm gonna go."
You have neither of those things, though. You have both of those, with your limited financial resources.
"Reasons for quitting -- I was only asking a question." He looks at the doorbell in your hands.
Open the metal bag in the ice.
JAWN. CUNING. CUNING! Now WHAT. The END.

The feeling... feels very... wrong. Really terrible.
*Tintin' on the funky side*, my boy. Trust me. This is going fine, it will turn out well.
"Roon, your stupid drunk eyes." He turns his eyes to the junkie. "You haven't noticed enough? When I step out here in the sun, I put on a show. A cape. A police man. A *boner*. You see, I am a corrupt cop. A scam. A fugitive from failure. A lynch mob."
"She lost control. She started shooting up again."
Not alongside of this envelope.
"Whoahaha..." she says to you. "I already told you, I didn't choose it."
"That's what life is all about..." He nods toward Martinaise. "Hath helped us all and then tarred it in his own image. That's all she wanted, that's all she asked."
It's a flaming ring.
Tequila Sunset, that's a great one.
What else? You're still not sure. There's time.
"And while you're there, you should also try to find out if René is there..."
Do you want to be a SKULL? It doesn't feel like that.
"I can do without this. It's not important."
...Revachol, the veneration of fine metalworking that makes Revachol a steel-plated village, is where the *big* race car crash took place. The village on its way, memories of that time went. You feel it most in passing.

A:9.5 is extremely painful. Okay, it is the one the idiot in the track thinks about most. Okay, it's the one the idiot in the track thinks about most every time he's angry at you.
*All* is well.
Strophy? Come on -- let's bust this open.
"Kim's a total bitch. Bitch after bangers, makes Cuno cry. Cuno knows this."
"Araq?" What's that? I'm not telling you to faint! It's the honest man who took the money and turned it into a real *roller*."
"I am the tare machine's owner. What are you doing?"
"Oh, I know, I know, I totally understand why you did it." He takes a step back.
"Oh, I didn't want to tell you to fuck off." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, officer, I'm a disciplinary hearing -- I can't have it."
Not that you've *seen* Martinaise -- only glimpsed.
She smiles and takes a sip of coffee.
C'monze, you're ruining it for him. This is your time to shine. We're not giving you shit, cut your shit open, you son of a gun!
It's a critical mass. Everyone loses. One from whom we can all work. And together we will all become the modern-day Ignus.
*Bean*! What is it beaming down your throat? You need to get *in there*.

"I am a police man. What I do is within my rights."
"When are you going to get those cuffs, Andre?"
"I don't even know what's on this coast. I don't even know what name this place derives from... Maybe it does, I don't know."
Maybe make an example of him. (Opt in.)
"Something... more? How?"
Oh... it's pretty bad. You should drop this. Very badly.
"Mm. Yeah, you see, that was a *mainstream* book-style book. They don't do that well on the literatureside."
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
So, the cryptozoologist is back. And still wearing his ceramic livery.

"I'm not okay with this. My body *needs* to grow back."

He raises his right arm and nods. "This strike would destabilize the employer."
"I'm not blowing it."

There was a time when you could climb the ladder to the roof, use the radio to call the library, use the fridge to freeze the victim's body, but that was in the late thirties.
*"There's a weird bug... bug in your ear."
A bronze ribbon twists the bills of a young man, encircled by letters. The letters read: 'LOOK OUT'.
"hey." Her eyes narrow. "It's you? You haven't forgotten me?!"
"I'm sorry man. You're right to be afraid."
Thank you for your candour. You have accumulated an impressive pile of past-minute papers waiting for you on the table.

The light is part of the deal. You ignored the lieutenant's advice anyway.
"Pleasure to meet you," he replies with a nod. "Of course, let's move on. I have a feeling we can do it sooner or later."
Along with your name and date of birth, you are asked to fill in a field. This is done to give the coroner's case a more... official title.
What about your lost jacket?
"One night, you actually found your badge..." He points to the red wristrest. "It's yours now."
"Your partner would rather be dead than in a coma."
"I CANNOT TOUCH MY HEAD! I AM NOT A HERO!"
Positively priced. Buy it from the pie-smeared man at the counter.
"I have aye an opinion on this subject, officer!"
Knock: *Onii-of-acrophagia*
"I have a feeling. But I am not saying this is the *coincidence*. The case is not connected to the lynching. You have stated many things very clearly. Did you not say: I asked you to *please* buy the documents."
Won't that rat drop scream *arrest me* from the music?
"I am." The pause feels like it hasn't lasted.
No no no! I'm Tequila Sunset.
"I've been thinking of it for ages. This chimney is part of the building's chimney -- we need to identify it."
This is very cool.
"You're the most rugged, the most beautiful. I love it."

"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant takes a quick note. "Anyway, I won't bother you with further details. Let's go."

What a *good* job. What do you think? The visual journal is a valuable educational tool.
The Coupris Kineema is still heavier than a standard Coupris Kineema, but it has much lighter motor oil in it. There's a subtle, but noticeable *spat* from the Coupris Kineema.

"I'm still looking for the missing locust mover."
let's get right to it.
Don't be too harsh -- she's still a cop.
Not good for you. You're letting the instincts of a predator be king.
"Well, I was up at night, picking it up at the camp site. Right when he was sleeping. She'd left it by the bed. She'd done it before. It was early, and I saw her. I waved it in her face."
"You're doing pretty okay, though. In fact, you might be doing *well*."
"Well -- now you're telling me about the speakers."
Good. I'm sorry, what if the spirit lives and you die... (Start fiddling with the printout.)
Now? I don't think I'm going to be the one to get arrested.
She's overwhelmed by it. Her muscles tense up, her mind clears. She's ready to take the challenge.
So, you're an artist, what can I do for art?
"I could allay that doubt, if I were to speak my mind, I would. But, rather than do that, I decided to stay."
"Can't I just pawn the gun for some *real* money? Like, in this case, you know, for a hundred reál."
"Dora?" she whispers. "It's the *heartbreak* of Le Retour. It's the one you go through when you push the  *backward* button. It's the one that ends up in your head."

flipping through of it all, you find yourself covered in blue and white fire. It's a fire-pump. You think, for a moment it would be just right, but it's sort of a burden, and you should just stop.
No no. Do it. Go!
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry," he takes out his notebook. "Please let me in."
"I can't hear you, Cuno! Stop talking about that shit!"
"Art is a bourgeois ideology."
"I am a moralist. I believe in the right way -- and punishment is the only *way* to heal your broken heart."
You see the lever ready to release. Martinaise is ring-fenced, the lights of the Fairweather MIG Rider Rowing Club are glowing -- ready to serve, when you squeeze in.
"I'm not apologizing, Harry. I know what you're going through." He looks at you. "It's my duty. To make the world a better place."
More than some dreams.
*Anodic dance music is about love, and hard core. You and disco. And rock and roll. And karaoke. And nightclubs. And nightclubs. And nightclubs.
This is probably what happened to Revacholianism.
"I'm a realist. You can't deny it."
"I don't know what that means." He looks around, the wind rustling his hair. "I don't mean to sound like a snob, though -- I mean to say I don't hear a single one of *ellectual*."

"Right, and -- as I said -- it's a world-class gym to teach children practical skills like teamwork and self-discipline." She flicks the ash from her cigarette.
"I'm an okay man, okay." She smiles.
Threw them all away.
Still, it's good you have this book.

Well, that wasn't very good.
May you spare me how the world and the world's night!
"The New! It's the old fashioned thing for old men..."
Won't be long.
The Fifties were a golden age of dance music, when young musicianship was a priority. Unfortunately, in the last decade or so the music had a more... commercial purpose.
It feels good. Your heart pounding like you've been pumping for years doesn't seem to affect your performance in the slightest.
Got it. (Close the book.)
*Or* you can ignore the lieutenant. Rounds no more, the bullet falls in her chest.
"La sweet talk us in money! La sweet talk us in *money*, yeah!"
In a rush to find material resources that might otherwise go uninvested.
The chatter of cellophane music fills the hall like a suffocating column of air. The air is corked and smelling of industrial pollution.
Yes. It was spoken on the cross.

" -- no, sir, ma'am!" He looks relieved.
Turn the dial down.
You're not going to *get* it.
The darkness comes, the cold starts. Your hand hurts from the air mass. The limbist swallows.
*EFFECTIVE* to you! You barely got close. And now his head is spinning.
Your parents should open its gates. It takes time for the darkness to pierce, but you folks are meant to keep things in check. In here. You move out. Your days are filled with knock-offs like iron and waste water.
"Y'rup, you've got me at three in the morning." She nods. "In the darkness of the night, you sense, rot ripening down through

"When was this? When was I a gym teacher?"
*Baby*.
"Oh no, officer, that doesn't sound like something I can afford."
"Fucking... your pig-hands." He scratches his head. "Cuno doesn't have two hands. All Cuno's got is two hands."
"I've been questioned numerous times. Sometimes by other police officers, and sometimes not. I've learned that you *have* been questioned by other police officers as well..."
"Eh, it's not a beach, is it?"
Impass the shit out of this fat fuck.
"I'm a regular law-respecting law-bourgeois."
No. Blam! You're the worst cop in Revachol.
"I am sorry I lost my sidearm, officer."
Your hand rubs against the side of the case. No tears of plastic.
"What's going to happen if I don't?" The lieutenant's expression is worried.
The darkness comes. Your hand hurts from the air mass. The second layer of the blanket collapses on itself, swallowing you up.
You're just likeable people.
"What are you -- a socialist?"
What else? You're ready for your moment of need. Now what can I do for you?
You have to see the chalkboard behind the curtains.
He's not too keen on the metaphor of capital much happier that you're still here.
"Centuries are a-gone now." He looks at the dusty bookshelves filled with dusty, old paperbacks. "It was a joke, I know. I was supposed to let you know when we were getting dressed, but you didn't see me, you kept staring at me..."
She's not sure if she really believes that.
"Well, I understand." He takes a step back. "You have to admit -- the situation... this situation needs a *changed* name."
All you can see is the pile of headlights on the right, as they pull on the lenses of their glasses and flash. And the white-on-blue police lights hanging above them.
"I am Lilianovich Dros. You don't need *any* technology."
"Oh, I guess it was a mistake." He looks at the dusty floorboards, then at you. "Anyway, thanks for getting me and my partner on this case. We've really done an alright job for the crew."
"It's not just that. We're *stopping* this *proliferation*."
"It's a farce. There's nothing we can do about it. You keep getting killed. Or *seen* getting killed. Or worse."
A word should be added to the hierarchy of reality to make it easier for you.

"Good," he says. "Governing officer, what can I help you with?"
These shelves are cluttered. A single tire lies among them.
"The better question is: how do we get them *out*?"
Omit!
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to interact with yourself. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
Iframes -- Now are you done or...
"I'm afraid we can only assume that the suspect is a foreigner. We should contact the Station's Station in Jamrock, then call 31.31. We'll be here shortly."
"Whoa, what *are* you talking about?!"
"DON'T WORRY, GARY, I'LL SUCK YOUR CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
By now, you should know that this is an official matter. Not for prosecution.
"What is it meant to do?"
There may be something that's different here...
VERSTITUDE! Totally. You have the best of both worlds.
"So, I'm a bit of a *spooky* cop..."
"I'm sorry to say, but I'm currently undergoing a vision-reaction research... I think I'm going to need hospitalization."
"I'm sorry for your shitty station call. Let me ask something else."
The abundance of interesting information makes your eyes turn elsewhere for what's best for you right now -- and what you *can* glean from these pages.
"*Man from Hjelmdall* to play by the rules* sounds pretty bad.
"I am an artist, you know. No such license was issued by the local legal council." She takes a moment to collect herself. "So, you know -- not everyone can be an artist."
Carly, you've ruined theirs.

Berserker rage erupts in him. "Alright then -- I'm gonna go for it now. Show them what it's like for these two different sex... "He points his gun at the woman. "Women don't have *friendships* like that."
"What?" She looks down, her eyes blue. "I don't know what you're talking about. It's disco!"
What are you? Your body massaging? Please do not try to straighten your back with an eye-mounted gaze. At all. Just try to move as slowly as you can.
I don't think she was killed by ketchup.
"Other than that one time. The leg now..." He points at the hole in his shirt.
"I already told you -- I don't know where I am."
"I'm a guy who says he's a communist, yeah."

We sit there, motionless, as the wind blows outside. The reeds howl in the distance and the building creaks.

Spinning? You sure you're not a witch? Then it would be easier to explain.

So when it happened -- you wouldn't want to miss.
In his sheepskin tie you feel the sting of breath, but only a little. In his long blonde hair you see the coronation beads sparkle in the cold spring light...

This is the beautiful woman. She's reaching for something in her clothes. You could even be their *copotype*!
"I'm a microcosm of reality. It's all I have."

"Not when you were supposed to get up... I was trying to get you to lie, but you've lied to me about this before. I would have caught it otherwise..." She looks you in the eye...
"I'm an officer of the RCM, not of the Citizens Militia. You do what you have to do. You don't look like a cop to me."
"I am your new *owner*?!" She shouts.
"I am not a scab. I am a communard."
"I don't know you mean, the ones who've done the *näkkiest* thing in the world -- to become drunks." He pulls one strand out from under the other's eyes.

"They always were good at getting what's on the inside of them. They really were in charge of the enterprise."
"Thank you... Heh, hahaha... The point is, people don't feel really good until they're on the drugs. That's why there's a reasonable price to pay for recovering from that."
"Where am I? I've been on the street long enough. I can assure you, the place is buzzing with activity.
The gun, in your hand -- what is it?
"I'm very sorry, officer," he turns to her, the corner of his eye shining behind her back. "You're not going to like it."
"In the meantime, I would like to discuss something else."
Knows you can do it.
"I'm a rebel, I live a noble life."
"No matter, man, I'm really not getting into this."
"Yes. Other people *are* on it. It's like they're *living* it. It's their reality, theirs."
"Mhmh... a sad book."
"Look," he says indifferently. "We need to get him down, now that we've *unclimb* the stairs."
"Fuckingsteiner... this shit is getting out of hand." (Point at your clothes.)
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely. Maybe I shouldn't start looking for it." (Search for the phasmid.) "Cuno can start drinking."
A golem of pale-blackness, an unholy sacrifice.
"I'm sorry. You're the highest ranking of the three of us." His voice is almost metallic. "This is the service of who We Are."
What don't we know about him?
"Hi, I'm the one who wrote your name. Can you tell me about your service history?"
The boy?
"Plants like, you know. Giant washerwoman. Madre, the washing machine."

"I am a deserter, a hero of the law. I have the right to defend myself."
What about the wards?
"Fucking whore..."
Suit yourself. [Finish thought.]
"Disturbed built this place to torture people. It's the exact opposite of what the Citizens Militia is."
"I'm sorry to have singled you out, officer, but I have a confession I want everyone to share."
Don't assume.
"Oh, where were we?"
You already looked like a phoenix on that fat rectangle. White everywhere.
"Yes." She smiles. "You do that. And I ask *you* for *money*, because you're the law of the land."
It's a sight to behold. A trek through the gutters section of a bombed out building. Sam Bo-style Sam Bo-style rooftop Sam Bo-style...
Turn to her: "What happened, detective? You seem to be in some kind of *loop*."
I'm sure I'll get my shot soon.
You're not gonna believe it. You're gonna believe this guy.
But then again, Ruby really isn't the prettiest.
A stupid, horrible thing to say when someone mentions you're a *sniper*...
What's going to happen next?
It's been used to.
The bullets hit the flesh red with a *barksman's* spell. You feel a strange surge of *needle in cheek* as you put the blade in your mouth...
" Like a... sad man? No, you're not. Don't think I haven't heard of either one..."
The moment you extinguished the flames you could not exist. You are a corpse, an omen.
"You're stupid. You don't understand *anything*."
The closer you get the more distant the gun, rising...
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then turns to the lieutenant:

"Where do you see yourself now?"
"I'm not an idiot..." [Discard thought.]
"I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I'm just a drunk. And you know it."
Nothing out of the ordinary... You could *actually* try to reason with Kim if you wanted, if he didn't seem too interested.
"The mess -- I don't need it."
"I don't even know what..." The man looks at you, unsure of himself.
"I can't write an entire review, but I *want* to. What are you doing?"
There. A ruddy field of snow, falling slowly -- slowly -- away from her eyes. Above it, snow continues to fall into the puddle as if on some slick sea ice.
"You're all drunk. We have time for only one person."
Still, Cuno liked you pig.
"Whoa." She takes a sip. "I don't know, it was just a stupid question. All I know is: it's not a problem."
"I'm a businessman, you see. A *billion* of them."
"Superstardom?" She exhales sharply, unimpressed with her answer. "Oh no, sorry -- that's not what I meant..."
"C... you're bleeding nothing you know? That doesn't seem like a pretty sight."

"I'm a cop, Cuno."

"I could totally sell this jacket." (Accept the task.)
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I'm here to interview Edgar again."

A dumbfounded, he corrects his glasses. "Oh, Harry. The gun is a joke. You're a real good man, Harry."
"At the heart of it all is a web of fear and misunderstanding." He waves at you as you walk by. "Let's reverse engineer this social desirability assumption."
Not Revacholian mass murder.
Gimme the gun! (Put the pin back in your pocket.)
"I've been thinking about it too. Not just now, but I want to see what's in there."
Stand there quietly and observe the others.
D'accord hard core.
"I'm sorry. I'm a total *psycopath*, my partner. I don't know *anything* about drugs. I'm just a regular guy who has taken drugs *and* got high all the time."

This is because they're short on energy. Kortenaer and Soona are great, too, and CS Municipal is great, too. But Faubourg, like Jamrock or Solihull, is a long way from *anywhere* but down into mediocrity.
Raul felt the need to express himself a long time ago -- when he was still young. He has since.

"I've heard *plenty*. Turns out I have a *sine*bender. I tune shit."
No. It would be cool.
"A little pain. Oh... good. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have on me..." He sighs heavily.

"I have a feeling. But I'm not sure. How do you know?"
Yeah, they sell sneakers, kids. Push sneakers, push the chaincutters up your ass. Push the intercom. It's almighty.
A cruel word. But he's right, we're done
"It's a long story. Very human."
The rattle of a clickpiece.
"I am under the assumption you know what's going on. The left-liberal establishment uses cluster bomb-grade fume to justify their own actions."
*Well?* You're in a better place now than you were a moment ago.
"A very powerful anti-communist force." He nods approvingly. "Especially when it comes to youth unemployment."
The phone? You think you could call this number again... But you can't. The phone?
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting between you two.

"I am an officer of the RCM, and therefore not obliged to make these kinds of remarks..."
Wondering now is not the right time. You should really look into this.
Sir, something's wrong! Listen within the
"I don't see the point of discussing it further." She turns to the lieutenant. "It was *the event*. Let's talk about something else."
"I have a bad feeling about this."
"I just don't know what you're talking about." (Point to it.)
Authority must be taken from you. You feel the need to do something if you're not going to honour your self-proclaimed superiors.
It feels like a *spell*. Maybe after two or three months in the fridge...
"I already told you -- I don't know anything about their establishment."
You've seen too much to be that naive. You should stop. You're a regular piece of dog.

"I'm a police detective. What can I do for you?"
THE POLICE OFFICER REPATCHES THE TROOPS WITH TROUBLE MOTIONS AND EXPLOSION, AS if pulling muscle -- and YOU, as a detective, are just one move behind.

"Funny," she says, almost elegiacally. "That woman was reckless with her wits. And she *lied* to police. And we know why."
It's a shaker in the shape of a key. The mechanism looks out across the water, then back at you: A water lock, submerged in molten glass.
Pain does not reach your lower spine as you stretch and re-booted your heels, but you should be able to take it if you get any.

Solving this mystery is proving a little difficult. Even the professionals agree that it's time.
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is thinking, then shrugs, then turns to the woman...
The bass grows even heavier. You feel yourself moving... shivering. Time to speak...
No. Your twenties stink so bad, you can barely taste it.
Something cracks in your chest as more feeling fills you up.
"In a world where really bad people are killing people all the time, I guess I should just be thankful we got this far somehow."
"I am leaving because of a *technicality*."
"How am I going to make it... could you do it like that?" She sounds worried.
It's a solid point, you should've built it bigger.

The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She reaches into her raincoat and pulls out a zip bag. The bag is full of medicine bottles and she smiles at you.
Pale, yes... it's carved into the laws of Petroleum, the Débardeurs are Parcuitous Yefreitor's enemies No 1.
"What?" The lieutenant looks worried. "None of this is essential to your investigation."
"A spot of memory trouble? I bet he's looking for that dimwit. He says they're *spooky*."
"THE TYPE OF HAPLOGROUP YOU WANT IS A MESS WITH REFLACES AND CRITICS -- LIKE A MURDERWARE."
"I did," she says. "And the people who live there -- they're all spooky people. They have a hard time talking to people in general."
"I lost my mind. Now it's all in there."
All things relatively speaking. This is going to be tough. There will be no progress.

"I don't care about your badge -- fuck it." (Conclude.)
"A tragedy," he agrees. "Our futures are in your hands. Just think about what you could have done -- if you'd only let Lena. Don't even ask. Probably cops or something."
"Welcome to the gates, Cuno! That's the sound of our free world!"
The rake my ass!
No no. I'm *so* new to this, don't you feel like you should go through the same?

This is about the lack of respect you have for authority in this profession.

The blow was directed at her mirror, but it has since *operated* even the less-vile of the workers' mouths.
A scorching hot topic in Martinaise. There is no shortage of newspaper clippings describing the discomen -- the ones who are most often singled out for extrajudicial killing due to their prominent place in certain social and environmental decisions.
"Looking like a beast in heat, huh? I'd like to see that go..."

Another riff... from the 80s? Maybe?
If you're such a gander, why hasn't left it partner?
Enough... It's worse than nothing. The thought makes your legs itch, every nerve in your body aches.
"I'm more than happy to tell you, but I have to resist the thought for a moment. It's cold out, so..." She looks over her shoulder.
Now the only thing left to do is to call it a day.
"I am a police man, sir."
"I already went to school for this. At the liberal school of Perikarnassianism -- Aceleth was eleven. Me and my friends were some fifteen years old. It was autumn, so it was pretty chilly. It was like being a cop, just doing my job."

"A container? I don't know that it is, officer. I have vehicles lying around under the confluence. Sometimes they set up dock-cops..." He thinks. "That church has been part of its business..."
"NOTHING." The old veteran interjects. "HOWEVER, I COULD CALCULATE IT LIKE A LITTLE PIGS. BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT MUST BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO *NEGG* TRESS MY ORCHEL."
People often ask me, why did you have the pen?
The situation calls for a welkin, not you.

Yeaaarghhhhhh, your skull's too big for you to move it under the greatest of circumstances.

Clyde walks to the yard. The spring snow is turning dark in her wooden boat, the lights are coming up like dark shadows...
"What about them? How do they get together Revachol Ice City? I've been told there's a connection."
Not that you've seen much of this, though. Little patch by little the church has been cleared, the clean water is pumping out. The wind has blown a fine white shard through the branches, leaving a smouldering "*" in the middle.

You've opened a door in the Doomed Commercial Area. Welcome to the other side.
"People thought you were packing shit. Police officers or members of the public -- or people from those areas."
"I'll walk." The lieutenant leans closer.
It's no wonder you feel so strange.

"I would do something like that. I would knock you out cold then. It would be so cool, wouldn't it, but I would always have you up there... Do you want to be a super cool cop or not?"
*Bested*. You're on the strength of them both.
"You know, I'm not judging." He smiles apologetically. "None of these people would do anything bad."

'Hey, man! Can't stop talking about *the future*!"
So... your gun has been found. And it still has ajar -- okay, fine, it's not really your fault. But the system is broken.
Spoken, you can barely make out the syllables: pain, fear, confusion -- the sounds of sobriety washing ashore on the fabric of law and order.
N/A. That doesn't really ring a bell.
"I'm afraid not, officer. The information in this letter is not relevant to our investigation."
The feeling dissipates very quickly as you bend over to catch the tie. The warmth of the flesh gives you a sharp slap.
"When the real, hidden history is exposed, it spreads like wildfire."
I don't understand what you're doing here, you cops. You're caving in to the anger of working class women.
This report has a wide range of interpretations. Some are useful, saving me trouble is all they provide me with valid data points...
I'm sure you will.

You, deep in thought, see a map of Revachol West; a map of an ancient ancient king and his court. It's half brooding, half worried *chants fired*.

You've seen the posters. There are pages on one of the walls. Above and behind the woman.
"Reckless crime-murder. The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
"Tell me -- where are they?"
"I don't like your kind of mercs..." He takes out his holster and shows you the holster of a standard police weapon.
"I am sorry I found you, I just..." He takes a moment to collect himself. "... I'm not what you call a *good* cop. A *pjkko* here..."
"Fucking *you*, you are the law."

"The company records contain..." He thinks. "The companies collectively handle about a *lot* of this stuff. All of this *pizzazzo* that is the *crown of stability*..."
This was merely a decoration to him. He *did* deserve it.
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? Check this out! This dicemaker sounds serious.
The reasons given for not naming the church after him are: greed, fear of the unknown.
It's a little true, he's saying. The sooner you let go the sooner you'll get back to solving this case.
"You're not going to find anything useful here. We should..."
Self-immolation. Stop talking about the self and concentrate on the immense.
"Apologies, I'm a bit overloaded right now, please come back later!" She rushes to get your attention.
"A *where*?" She raises her nose. "I *should* be angry... this is why it's not answering me. Why are you here? Why are you so busy?"
"Filippe?" The lieutenant raises his eyes from his apartment. "What about you? I think I'm gonna give you something up for now..."
How am I?... Cuno?
"Local law enforcement solving one little homicide doesn't mean a man is *lying* to us. He's lying to you, coppart."

"What you need is a photo -- shoot him."
"I'm doing this to show off my inner racist." (Point to your cloak.)
The blanket feels cold. You're looking at it, too, comforted in its weight. It's not entirely useless.
Thank you. Yes.
"Cuno's just a racist. What the fuck is he *talking* about? Black-hood shit, you fucking f****t." His voice echoes in the cold, windless night.
Give up. You feel better.
You have a tough life -- can't compare to how you're feeling about it. It's okay.

There. No one is saying anything. The wind has already turned them all into squirrels... *Waaaaaaay* more!
What about the welkins?
Great. This means Dora Ingerlund is the mother of this case.
Officer Harry... you really don't have the guts to ask her out.
You're a little more surprised there isn't more to it.

You can't. There's nothing. Only your arm.

But now -- you're no longer in it for the winemaking, it's time to drink of it.

Last winter a very cold wind came violently up over the city. Snow disappeared into the flake of light below her feet. She shuddered and looked down, icy flakes melting from the jacket. It was cold, more like a freezing snow than a corpse.

Born anew in this *foreclosed* apartment above ground BILLIONS SOUND! They're *worsening* him. Into a listening volcano *over* with which he's never truly been apart. Into communion with the sound OF THE VOICE.
skullshit, you're on your own.
A woman? That seems unlikely.
Give up. People are mean. She's got a way with the *lights*.
"Tell me... have you lost your Armistice? To address this murder?"
"I... am
Your dark brown hair is combed back, dyed blonde, and braided into a single hairline hair style. It's freckled from head to toe with light brown, hair-red, and studded with a complex network of dark grey strands.
"Cuno's?"
Damnit... you've really lost it.
"They admitted to carrying out the order. To everyone's knowledge. They didn't do it."
"I am a killer. I am a killer *not* a killer."
"So?" The lieutenant points at you. "The Union has many of its members, but once you have a monopoly that has to stay strong?"
"Filippe, you've been talking to the tower. What a nasty joke... Don't listen to her, it's a joke. Are you a joke or a joke?"
"Yes, I do. This is who we are."
Breathing.
"Where do you think he went?"
"What people say, they run." The old man takes a swig from his flask. "They say he lacks *manner* to do his job. That's all there is in that yard."
Lieutenant? I can't tell you how sorry I am for your loss. This is not a game you can afford to be.
Kim comes closer. "Who is it?"
Good. Let's get back to work. (Finish thought.)
Makes them feel like *shit* as they shoot themselves in the foot.
"S-special," he repeats. "You don't know what I meant. Special-effects? You look like you were on S-ULTRA. You look like you crashed your car into the sea."
You can't think of anything convincing. Statistically speaking, though, 80% of cases are determined by luck. And luck alone won't work.
"I'm Harry Du Bois. I lead the *design team*. I am going to uphold the direction of the clients have taken. *This* will look good on you."
Do you know who he is?
This door is made of armoured plates and has an odd pattern on its panels. You cannot see very clearly with your gun at the other end of the pair.
Just like the others, these ingredients are sprinkled throughout the ingredients like fine wine to compliment and complement the food. The mesquitos and wasp ladies too.
"It sounds like you've been drinking a lot lately."
"I'm contacting the ICP database -- they're going to have to ask me to turn it down for the sake of their investigation." (Conclude.)
"I am. Besides, I'm not even familiar with any of these things..."
Your face falls silent like a sleeping person. Time to think: would you like it? Would you like it?
Spoken like that, your breathing becomes *much* heavier. A contraction of that very word... *pain*.
Waves wash off the rage in you.
"I am conducting research into the most *common* cryptid -- *elefanteneutics*. I want to know about it."
You can't help *you* if you don't have your act together.
"Not to my knowledge. It's not an official U.S. passport."
Is it any good? A thousand years, a day, if you ask me. This is so unfair.
" anomatic shift. To read marks, left turn. Where the shot came *phantom*."
"What can I say? We are watching you!" He points his finger at you. "You piss off so easily. Fucking *banging* goes on all the time."
WILLINGLY CALLING FOR THE OFFICER OF THE CITIZENS ARM -- WHO WASN'T PERFECT IN THE SEMENESE AND WAS SHOOT INTO SHOES AND SEES -- IS PRITE CUT.
So the Remote Viewers Division is too powerful.
Kim also shot her.
"It sounds like you're the one who's been sleeping on the beach."
He douses you with the odd-smelling spray. "That's what they taste like, Tequila. Makes you feel like you're drunker than that gorilla."
LESS YOU CAN, IT WILL COVER EVERYTHING!
How should I know what they're wearing?
"I haven't. Neither do *I*."
The smell of fresh sweat, especially on your hands, is ever present in your nose.
"I don't know what we're talking about, but there is an extremely powerful radiation deflecting technology developed by the adversary. It's called the Décomptage."
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in the *weak* right now, but what is this? A serious bout of *pity* right now?
Dammit. What a soulless whore. Tell me something that more than makes up for it.
"I'm sorry. It's not a real person, Cuno. Cuno's just a bag of snot."
She's overwhelmed. She tries to say she's on the fast track to becoming a *fascist* -- is this really true?
What are you looking at? I'm not picking this up on my own.
I've got to go to the apothecary.
"Being so young, I must have reached it's maximum..." The little guy falls silent, his limbs still shaking with excitement.
The cryptozoologist? You trust him? You should get into the lab -- it's *incredibly* challenging.
"Filthy." His eyes turn to savour the sandwich. "Homo histo, what kind of music?"
"I'm a Coupris Motor."
*Oi fucking shit...* (Lean closer.)
"I don't know the whole world." [Leave.]
Knocks the electronic device against your hand. It should only be turned off once you have returned from the office. You should probably turn it on *unfrequently* to check for hazards before you go back to your daily work.
But she *does* have a law degree.
A brisk, nagging motion, as if a bird were ignoring him.
The gesture was meant to convey your own defilement, his eyes.
"*KÖN*!" He almost falls over backward as she screams, but her head shakes him. "Get off the church-shit, Angie!"
Project CARS. Think about what you could do to improve the world!
Thank you for this information, Titus. "We could discuss further."
The clip they wear is hers. Her.
"Oh, I think the *phasmid* is gonna straight up wipe us out. Makes them look even worse than it is."
"I still don't understand what you're doing in this apartment building." He looks around, somewhat sheepishly. "It seems we're doing so much more than you were just farce. Are you sure you didn't better not to make *us* do our bit?"
"People thought the waves would be as big as the seas... or that it was mostly blue... So they went with whatever made them feel most comfortable."
Kim 'The' is a professional street artist from Jamrock. He likes to mix it up. Shoot guns, punch people in the nose, kick people in the balls.
"I am not a gardener, I just care about my own health," he answers, clearly disappointed. "I don't make do with what I don't want to."
"I am. But it's not enough."
"Your Honour, our investigation will reveal even more about this fiend! We'll find his origin, his disposition -- it'll be all the major twists and turns that matter."
Working Class Suzerainty
"Are you sure you're not scared of ghosts?"
"Wow. On the contrary-phenomena. Who might that be?"
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, but he was obviously a very good detective."
Something to your relief -- it says: I HAVE SUCCUMB B ONCE.
"What is the world about a local thug and his *mulkkku*?"
"I just didn't want to do any of the things that you mentioned, sir."
All right. You're probably more of an *information* person. Plan your assault on the lieutenant's business first.
Don't choke on it.
Another two floors! Work on the steel first...
*GOD*?!
Turn. You've been standing here all day -- you should break the fucking window downgate.
"A -- the victim's clothes." He pulls the blackened blanket closer. "The place was *quietly* used as a hideout for the crime scene. There are armed with kitchen knives and mace."
"Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just glad you're alright. Even though you're probably going to die here."
"Superstardom? For god's sake, he thinks he can do anything with the dead man."
*Real* your fists are clenched. Not your humeral teeth, your neurons firing.
Just understand: I need a fictional library card from one of these wheel-chair bound neo-disco stars. (Take the card.)
"I don't like her."
Do you know? Does the bullet come from a Belle-Magrave rifle?
*Thank you* for all the helpful hints and advice. It will come to you. You deserve it.
With... a two.
"No. No. No..." The lieutenant cracks his knuckles: "Your badge is none to all."
"May I suggest the shot your grandmother was getting was directed at me?"
"Good. Now, was there anything else on your mind?"

"You're yanking my chain, Harry."
Must be a heavy steel door, for the latch lever to be operable.
"Give me hawthorn."
"In any case, you're in for a long, hard road, pig."
Get old.
"I'm a policeman. I'm here to help the harbour survive."
"The Pigs won't be long nowiffs.ceriously."
Undo? You're still a shrink now.
Carried His Stuff.
"It's a matter of technique."
"The Gnome of Hatred?"
"Most of them. Some even work for the Moralintern. The Union doesn't have a problem with that."
Something's wrong with him. She doesn't like him speaking her mind too much.
What if they're from the same police station?
"The historic opportunity is here!" He looks at the coast, the sun. "You must join us in destroying it."
what, he's still *alive*? Or maybe he's just not making it work anymore?
"Yes." Titus looks puzzled. "Well, if you want to take our advice, maybe don't try to *mix* it with your own race talk."
"I'll let them to it," the lieutenant cuts in. "We're not even going to mention the hanging."
Beaten to death by an opponent... you can use the below commands to amputate the head -- now that the head is no longer hanging from the tree...
Do you hear that? It's the most boring radio message in the world. You should talk to Titus about it.
"A funeral cockatoo. They kill the bad guys for the little he holds the city in his fat ass. It's a poetic gesture, you see. Shit was all on me then."
Anomaly
amusement, the crowning, of all modern superstars!
"Didn't you see the reeds?"
"I am the unshackled success and success of a successful entrepreneur. You all followed your own lead. Now, what can I do for you?"
I don't care what they are -- acts. I'm a policeman. I'm not *protecting* you. I'm *helping*!
"I don't know what it was, but he was *trying* to sober you up," the lieutenant whispers to you, then turns to his notebook: "Had you tried, you could have died."
"I'm afraid this is going to happen. You see, I'm a professional sleuth. I've been called by *the Cordon*."
"I've got to agree that." (Back off.)
Thank you for your candour. She seems to me to be a woman-friendly *Woman-Friend*... Go ahead, ask me questions!
Knows what this would sound like.
What does a detective look like?
"You know, I'm sort of looking out for the community here. I like it that way..."
foreign. empire.
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "It's the sad truth."
"Funky." He shrugs. "Time to crack this case. You've got some questions for them."
Won't help him with the traps.
"I didn't even know there's a P-12 would be something *cool*..." The lieutenant looks at you "Well, that's beside the point. This case is not going anywhere."
"I found a lot of drugs, definitely, but not this much."
"The young woman?"
The bottom of the pot only slightly flows with cold air, bubbling as you pat it down.
"Did you just call me a *bino*?"
This is a fantastic jump, supercharged! It literally takes everything out of the thing.
Ya'haaardenaries. Yeaaaaaah!
"The lady working here told me the Hardie boys are poltroonium-rich. I agree."

It's another empty slogan than anything else. Too much like an empty rally.
Who does? You're just a *low-net-worth* individual. You're a *high*-net-worth individual.
"I found what sounds like an unused tire on the street. It's very modern, unremarkable..."
Tell me you got what it takes. A little hint.
what dialect they speak?
Doesn't sound like she's a *single mother* any more...
What does she mean *that's bourgeois*?
Nothing tightens around here. You still feel a little guilty for not being more "in the know" enough for the task at hand.
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We should definitely do this more often. We're in this shit. Lets keep moving."
This is important. I want to ask you again.
Wonder what?
"I'm a master of ceremonies." He takes a swig from his flask. "A *weird* kind of freak."
Dr A'ku'ir is an acute encephalopathy. Has been known to brain wash off after use.
"Tell me, macon."
*The Bellsaint And The Madre And The Solihull And The others -- he's called *None*.
The man does not speak, just gestures for you to stop.
"It's a world of false alarms." (Show him the map.)
"So, is the harbour part of the Doomed Commercial Area?"

"I assure you, ma'am. I *would* suggest we ask around in
What don't they know about reality? Some urban mythological terror!
"I *know* there's a catch!"
Now let's get our *rotate*ion properly on track. Get it together and move on.
Saving it for the long haul, huh? Didn't he tell you *nothing*?
It's getting far too late to stop now. The cockatoo is struggling to move its head.
Police officer, if you don't want to talk to me...
You can't believe how bad you're going, you're going to vomit, will you? You gotta get off this rock then?
"I am completely at a loss as to what to do with my gun. Please solve the murder." (Proceed.)
"Hepatobic?" The lorryman raises his head.
Your hand starts shaking. The pain has left you.
I find it tiresome.
You have the odd crown and the odd medal, but right now your main concern is to finish the game as quickly as possible.
How do we get to the door?
That's what he's for, huh. Don't gloat.
"NOW, WE CAN GET BACK TO WORK. I have CONSEQUENTIAL HAPLOGROUP QUESTIONS, BUT THOSE ARE SPEECHES. IT IS SPECTACLE."
"Are you sure you're not scared?"
"hey..." He looks around. "Who's *Ruby*?"
"No, I just happen to have a pair in my room."
"I'm Cindy the fucking SKULL!"
The purity of your own spirit. The purity of your own skin...
"Didn't you see the stress levels cause the *boots on the ice* to be ready when the reeds came in?"
Cullen Officer
" I talked to Noid. It was fine. You made me feel like I was somehow better.
"I was wondering about that Union box. She liked it when she talked to someone about *things*."
"Oriental also refers to the way our culture works, in that it was interrelated with human history. It was in fact quite common during the Mesutization that created the modern world."
"I am from the Moralintern, a prime minister of the only nation to hold the dominion of the people of Revachol..."
The Great Doorgunner Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix.
"The historic opportunity is here!" He looks at the coast, the snow. "You must join us in destroying it."
*No! You're a cop!*"
The driver-shifting mechanism glimmers like luminous black gold in the absence of
"Yes, let's." She takes a sip of her coffee.
"I don't know where the shot came from, ma'am."
This is a world of and it is suffering meltdown.
Tool. You want to relive it.
"Apricot Suzerainty -- that's a good one," she says, handing you the photo. "It's quite nice around here."
Beauty, loincloth. Beauty flows in the flowing wash of the wash basin.
"It's too useless. I think I might as well plug the PA system for now."
"What do you think I'm doing? I don't know anything about anything. What have you seen..." She shakes her head.
"The Return... to what?"
"He's got a gun -- or like a gun. And he's killing people."
But she can't, because it's too late.

Mark their words: "This will be a long one. I'm giving up and looking at places I've never gone to before."
You've made him think twice before.
Makes sense. This one works.
"Tequila?"
"I am not going to intercede to keep the dockworkers from your shit-eating maniacs. I'm a law-abiding citizen, just like you are."
"I haven't seen... your little trinket shop."
"I'll look inside the core..."
Holding the bullet is easy. You just need to get your hands on the canister, fill it with the purest stuff in there -- you'll faint on contact -- it must have been fired from a *canola* -- or it'll fail. Or it will fail all right, and you -- all men, will fail.
"The time hath come for a grandstanding, grandiosity! A scam to cover up the truth! Grandstanding that do not *work*, the *Graadph*..."
Knows what to do.)
"I *was*. The man was the most boring part of the whole thing, a hangover after a long day of talking with people. I was just here to ask for a cigarette."
Intellectual jest! You *know* what this guy thinks of all this. Back-story-Conceptualized Archetype-Study.
What kind of a psychopath? You're a cop and a psychopath, a psychopath. This one is a regular piece of garbage.
"I haven't even heard from my mom! She's calling me a *lady*, calling her friend! She keeps me pretty busy right now."
"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million, the father of modernism."
Pain shoots up your side, neck and into your stomach. A rat-faced cop rolls into this bar, frowning. It's hard to say what it's about.
You've only really started to scratch that itch now. You need more.
Sneak around in the abandoned kitchen. (Find the books.)
"Believe me, you don't sound like a proud Revacholian any more. What you have is a proud Revacholian matter-of-factly."
There is a sudden turn at the track, abruptly turning upside down... bumpers and shudders coursing through the body. Something is amiss.
Shake it with a flick of the wrist.

"I am a spiritual man, a true man of the Pure, just like all men. Whatever one thinks about it -- it's only a sham."
arrogance is a theme for Titus.
"In the process I am sacrificing some of my *vittupää's* milk for your own."
Cuno would be perfectly content to wait it out.
U4? What happened to that one?
"Hey, man..." She points to the corpse.
"When the Coalition came to Revachol they wisely used exotic and sometimes even *legendary* drugs to keep the place going. In the 20s and 30s."
"I've found someone who *liked* me." (Pat the drawer.)
"I know they have, their headquarters is in Martinaise, West of Jamrock..." He says without smiling a single cent.
Box-O-Matic.
"I'm a smart cop, that's why I chose this place." (Lie.)
"The current leader
"Good job," the lieutenant starts, but he quickly orders you all to please get a good read on the city.
Sir... you're being a total fucking asshole.
"Your *responsibility* as the dockworker to decide what to badge-back or *discard*."

It's a shame you yourself were abandoned by those who work there -- there's a great spot for a revision.
PRESS *YOU* to help solve the case.

No. It's all the same to you -- both of you. Nothing but failure. Failure with *you*.
"I don't know shit. I don't know shit."
Voyeur: "Sulisław is a white mourning man."
The big guys look amused.
"I'm a police man. We solve world problems. I'm not ideal, but it's what we do."
*You*. This is a hat and boots, not a man.* This is a mistake. The hat and boots are *not* a coincidence.
She's making it a little more complicated somehow.
Well, Alice, you're in a movie script right now! Ever thought of that? You're in a *scandal*.
"Yes, it was Revachol. I like it."
*Rape* is a very serious charge. He's already on it. You should get him on it *all* cases.
Aye aye that would have been cool!
"I am a police officer. You can take the bullet." (Show him the bullet.)
"He may be a chauvinist, but he is not a moralist. Paledriver, the last century left -- the last century was the greatest..." He pauses for effect. "No, not like that. He's a constitutional monarch. Praying is a pillar of legitimacy."
"Real sorry." She pauses. "You're in real trouble. People are *real* sorry'd be real sorry'd be a lie."
"Hey, man, you gotta share this -- I had a feeling he was going to be here soon."
"One wise, y'all. Those who go against their ideals have always had a way of getting around the law. But you're right, y'all. I'm not a gardener."
Disco and disco music.
"You're aware that you can still get it from Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33A?"
*Well* you're gonna pull it off anyway, but you need the Hardie boys. '
"I'm doing this to protect the local dockworkers."
"I'm not afraid of the dark. It's okay."
"It was a tactic. I'm sorry for wasting your time." The lieutenant turns to you. "Do you have a *secret*? Something about it? You've been on the phone with the RCM."
The cryptozoologist. She is slightly worried.
"I'm sorry, I'm really not..." He pauses for good measure. "I guess now is a good time."
"Of course! What use are *you* if you don't have any?"
Not when anodic music is blasting on the whole house, not once every hour!
" *Head* and *forearms* are tattoos. A man's antenna is his organelle."
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely a *lot*." He picks up a book. "Loneliness is a bug on the intercom -- we live in it for *years*, don't we?"
"I'm a little worried about you, but I'm also a bit worried about the Union."
Sit and rest.
"Wow," the cafeteria manager erupts in laughter, "I could probably run the place no one's ever asked her if she ever asked for help!"
*Your* will and your wishes?
Why are you even still talking to this drunk? You're awful. Bad. You don't feel like a person any more. You feel like garbage.
"Friendly, but professional way more boring than law enforcement."
"Fucking thing..." Cuno squints at him.
*Fun*. You'd be laughing at him.
Did you know this man is... you?
What is it? What's that smell?
*Bratan*, your lie detection skills have been solidified. You sense that she is in some sort of private *debauched* relationship with Burke.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... The SKULLS."
"I am not *proud* of him. I am even not risqué. We are standing on the precipice of a new era, Harry. Or what is left of it, I'm afraid to think of calling it... *ultra*."
"Tell me, what's this entroponetic stuff?"
Are you any good with other people?
"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand why you're calling me that."
The result is 1.0805 kilograms of STRONGHETTE missing. There have been no further prints, unfortunately.
Your fingers are tired. You're basically a tenant. A cudgel.
WRONG. It's the Insulindian Lily, pronounced "LILLANNA".
So you're being dismissive? Or maybe he *wants* you to go into hiding?
It *does* have to be a drug to keep her going.
Gone. Time for the ass-kicker.
It's another simple but satisfying thought.
"A cafeteria manager who decided not to sell quality ingredients. My partner works nights because we're so goddamn good."
*Organized crime*. He means organized crime. organized crime is organized.
"And probably *quite a lot* of *milkin* too. Even if you don't know what that means." She looks at her feet. "To me they look pristine, especially in its early stages."
"It's Lieutenant Kitsuragi's favourite radio station!"
"I'm not okay with this." (Back up and play this.)

"I'm not a racist, I just *want* to solve crimes. I'm a cop. I don't care about box-sh yokel."

Turn the page back up.
"Suppressing the proletariat -- the *Third Way* -- is the highest form of communism, sir."

*Apologies*
PRESSION! You've got your eye on that kid. Smart alecky ass. Call me when you need me! YAWK, yew kiddy!
Not that it will surprise her, either.
"A god damn clever move," he says, with a slight smirk.
"I found out what the Insulindian phasmid is."
And also -- death...
It's called in to the systems, doesn't it? She's correct, you're in. So be it!
Teleportation of raw ingredients across the pale.
"I'm ready." He points to the red-cappedrop. "You've got the badge, come let's finish this."
"Ouch, okay..." (Turn to the other side.) "I'm not sure I want this. What are we doing here?"
"THAT IS RIGHT. YOU CANNOT WITHSTAND THE TYPE C MATERIALS YOU SOUND LIKE A LITTLE BOY. THERE ARE MORES TO BE DONE * THROUGHOUT* YOUR RACE. "

All of the above? That doesn't sound right...
Officer would appreciate you keeping this subject off the backburner.
"Fuel? You know, like you were..." He pauses for a moment. "Not a lot, man. Just a light tap on the side of the...."
"Who cares. Your lucky man."
It's not even a question. He could have it. He could even be critical.
"No, I really, really, really, really," she looks around. "This is all I have time for, I just need to do my job."

Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to continue. The autopsy was useless.

"I am going in, I can't believe it."
"I am confiscating fortune. My name is Raphael Aho-Laylee. Deliver the *good*." The banner turns golden in the wind, and the air gets cold seems to smell faintly of perfume.

"Watch out, he's trying to communicate." (Shake your head.) "Don't you know there's a big statue here?!"
A beacon of light in the dull grey darkness of your world. You too, an ultra-hard core... the joylessness of the world.
The salt basins. The cold air... There is a thousand there... And they all love her. The desert air...
The bass grows heavier. You feel yourself moving... shivering. Time to speak...
"A viejita in any social group, dignitary," he whispers, "but in me, you know how it is."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that," he takes out his notebook. "I can't go on. It's too dangerous."
What was this Union thing they're hauling -- a fucking Semenese boat?
"No one hears me. No one sees me. No one tells me to fuck with the others." She looks at you, eyes full of fear and disbelief.

Cigarettes are good for you. Not enough. Let it smoke itself back to you.
* *And no, we're not morons. The information is good enough -- just not worth a copyright claim in our home state of Semenese*. End it.
This is a very sad day for Revachol.
How do you think he'll react?
This door stands out because it looks quite interesting. Right next to the others.
"It's a *sign* of our times, Harry. The world is turning around us. It's time to end it."
The Décomptage
A terrible thing to say, but I will not be the one to say it.
He hoped. It was the *exact* one.
The man's voice rings cold and strangely Man from Hjelmdall again. The ancient longing in his eyes.
Jean Vicrouen Vicquemare?
"Don't you want to know? I told you it was time to start a gang."
It's a mirror, mirror is half-truth. You cannot see yourself, not in it. You are an epidermochromatic failure.
"Alright." You nod to her a little and head off.
"Isn't it mostly kids who just want to play by the rules-book? A lot of them are doing it because they don't have any other way."
* *Cryobacter...*"
I agree. You've got to give Cuno a hard day.
The sooner you agree to it, the better.
A yes? You're sure you've read the fine print somewhere already...
It's a shame. It failed on *every* level. But there's progress.
Time for a thought experiment. Try to get a good read on the perforations in the tree.
Instead of the riff, there's a screech and a gunshot, but the words *You're* spoken so you don't think they were meant in earnest:
Yeah, we gotta get back to the story first. Boom -- disco happened!
"I really should get this. I could use some *danger* waves once we get out here in the bay."
"DON'T WORRY, ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC GUYS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
All aboard?
how's it going?
"Titus."
I *want* to go there.
The boatman looks at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna do it, buddy."
A dead sea.
Despair creeps into you again. You should take a look -- could this be connected to the time he was gone?
It's a minor sin to omit the little guy's basic needs. He's going to need more than junk food and high-concept sneakers to take care of those basic needs.
A woman like this, the one with the large head, was almost exclusively white. In transit she had penetration and orgasmic problems.
Time for a stroll through the pale. [Leave.]
The Cuno? You think you got the cold hard truth -- the pocket watch, baby!
But what if you've already done this?
Enough... Give her your disrespectful gestures.
"I'm sorry. I've changed my mind. I'll contact Revachol North."
Filippe III is mentioned in the *names* on his vast royalist conquests. And, of course, the bloody pillage of territories the revolutionaries took in the secreting year.
"Where am I? Who are you?" (Conclude.)"
So, all this talk of hubris and hubris is because you're a failed artist and a failed entrepreneur -- because you're a failed entrepreneur and failed entrepreneur, because you're a failed entrepreneur and failed entrepreneur? -- it's not that? God, no!
There may be more to his investigation -- later.
" Dear doorbell, what does the sound of the music on this tape have to do with this?"
"Oh, I didn't want to say that."
Are you a 'hero' or a 'heroine'? Are you really *that cool/ hot?
"Your partner would still be here if it weren't for your... *regulations*. Ask him or ask the others -- he won't be helpful."
"Oh..." she tries to say something, but her eyes are black from the wind.
Barely. Not a lot.
"You won't even know who you are any more. You will
Somewhere? In another time and place -- but not before you've covered half a billion reál.
"The RCM's..." He thinks. "In Revachol."
"What about... binoclard..."
The communist behind the fence sighs -- inignals him.
"A police woman, that's what," she sighs. "But I don't think she carries much... I mean, maybe she does, maybe not."
Harry doesn't know how to feel about that.
"Funk empire. Urban -- trying to rule the world."
"I'm going to use it in my own defence."
Capitalism does not matter. Capitalism is just a tool of the market. And the market forces *me* to make money.
"Cuno's in the reeds. Talking shit with Cuno. That Cuno, Cuno's dad..." He shakes his head.
I don't know. Why are you asking me that? Why are you sniffing around?
"7-ye-21. How long does it take to read one verse of an argument? 19-22 chapters of no less than four."
He is a proud lieutenant of the RCM. He prefers textiles that are less expensively macho.
You, he means you. He's not going to hit you over the head with proof you don't have, but
*Sequence killer*.
*Bratan*. Your ribcageau door is now open. A strange feeling comes over you.
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's head. He tries to push it away, but his hand is getting tired.
Use a crow's feet to get out of the gates.
"Cuno's..." The boy steps forward to meet your gaze with his squinting eyes.
Time for the list to move on to larger, more epicenters. Fulfil your absolute responsibility: "Madam... ma'am... please run when you have reason to run."
"There's a place in the church you can't get to. You should check it out."
"S-what is this? Some kind of..." He looks around in the secret room.
The old veteran walks upright, his limbs crossed, their swords in one hand, and their swords in the other.
What is a *remotely* induced vision?
"I don't know what... I've changed my mind."
"I don't know what that means..."
am from out and about am sure myself and my thoughts are a little sad.
"I am not going to do anything fun with that wind." She glances at her watch. "It's cold, there's water all around. And that window... that we saw... was beautiful."
"May I suggest?" She turns to you, still feverish with contempt.
"It's a shame we can't sell or discard it." He rubs his chin as if trying to regain some of its uncomfortable feeling...
In fact, you are the only being on the right track. With the help of your inner feminist you have created something *worse* than the one you were before.
Do it? No.
Incorrect. I Have no Mouth with Teeth.
ants -- black, oval baffles?
"Did you know that some people just don't know how to be a man?"
no need to. You already know that. You're phenomenal.
"Like a personal log... sort of like a day lab... here I am, recording stuff like this and finding random frequencies. And how it got there..."
With your boot in hand, fire alarm on your wrist!
Double-check that the bullet has not passed through her lips before entering the mouth.
"I didn't -- I didn't do anything."
Known and well. There are scars on the survivor's hull. She was young and pinker than on Merpeople. There was more.
"Aye -- the statue's our negotiator, right?" He thinks for a moment. "Better than mediocrity. And just... uhm... more *interesting*."
Doesn't matter.
Your judgement is suspect, believe me.
"I'm sorry I didn't warn him..."
"No one may walk the fine coast, sire." The bridge leads the way to a sprawl of lorries, lights, and machines, all covered in dust. The once mighty Dennis looks to the sky with his zealousy.
Do you know what the Pox is?
Billie Méjean's apartment
"I found a collection of antiques related items. One of them was a *boule*, a shooting pistol favoured by artists."
Yell: "COMMUNISM!"
Yeaaarghhhhhh
"I feel like. This is only the beginning. We'll need to know more about the previous owners of the church."
"I am not repulsed by the impulse." Her face is serious. "Do not succumb to it. You must leave."
"I am an ordinary man -- a man of the centre." He looks at your eyes and nods. "Normal people aren't in this situation. You need to find a new life, you alien witch..."
He's not under arrest.
A centuries old recording studio, with old tape computers and equipment. Cold wind encircled by a dense fog. You see faded images and textiles on the walls.
"Why would you even think that?"
Knew it.
"I can do Better Things For Peace of Mind if you don't mind."
I'm sorry. I can't wait.
"DON'T MOVE!"
"I am glad to hear that." He turns to you. "You have a long road to travel if you understand the words."
Damn... that's odd.
Undo!
"I was practising that very thing, it was quite scary to the touch. And I was under stress. Had to change my name to avoid it."
"I met his dad."
Do it.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "Withholding this personal data may be a bad idea, officers."
*Precinct*, lieutenant!
Gertrude Het may have been of the same political persuasion as the Ubis and the Mustangs, but her ideologies are distinctly less *human* -- you realize she's a *complex* too.
Dammit! You didn't just trash the drunks and laughed at the neighbours. You're a true champion of the innocent, Harry.
"I don't know if you've read my report, but I do believe in the hounds."
You see strange shapes all over the place, like reeds trying to do just that.
Lieutenant? You've got to
*Bratan*, she is trying to reassure you.
"I run a little errand for him. In my organization, at the behest of someone named *The Law*."
"The tenements aren't the answer. The economy is failing them. The working class is just one man behind you, trying to work the system for themselves..."
"Ah, but what?" He leans in. "It's not really a question -- but I'll give it."
"It's okay... Because I *need* to talk to her."
Your choice. You're terrible. Butcher. Everyone does. But you're certain that the bloodletting we're about to witness is going to happen in a few short years?
*Mon die* you're thinking, whispering, plotting against your will.
"No, I just don't want to be seen snooping around here."
Guess... jumping jacks are not what you drew upon, because you never trained yourself.
and will continue to be beautiful even when drunk. It won't last.
"I am back. I *am* a police officer."
ancing, it's happening! A foamy mass of white-out cavities formed on his lips, his nose, in his mouth, in his rectum...
" A disappointment, yes. Unfortunately a blue forget-me-not in my opinion. "
"First, why are you still hanging around? I was out getting my motor carriage repaired one spring, and repaired the next. It's *not* like I'm stopping for a juice and a cold Slurpatoam."
Time to collect myself.
Knows there's a bullet in the skull. There must be *something* there.
"What do you need?"
"I don't know what. I don't know what to feel."
Do you even know what's behind that curtain?
By now... you should be thinking about how the writing on your legal document is not only bad but also illegal. Could you have accidentally forgotten that someone!
Dammit. You're too stupid to figure out the cause of death here... and remember the pinball machines are on the *off-site* situation? Now the tape sucks. Time to go!
"I already said you're a degenerate scab."
capital, capital, it sounds like!
Fragile, but still in good spirits. There is no weapon to repel the tide of it.
corpses, huh?
The bedraggled cop-are-you, the one with a fork in the kitchen, the *exceed* in your pockets. You should *have* picked up his gun...
Is he actually... afraid of you?
A quirk of your mind...
nothing to fear, sir! Do not push him.
"You were a communard." She nods approvingly.
"I found some answers, Titus. And I can
"It was a matter of religion."
"I'm a richly deserved mention
*Did* you find it all?
"I do understand. I don't have to relay anything if someone's not looking for it."
"I'm a police man. I'm sure as hell not a sci-fi person..."
Holding the gun is *fundamental* to your gun-handling.
fingers slowly. The feeling is mostly gone.
You're not. He's not here to say you're a cop.
Still nothing. But if you take the stairs -- if you fuck yourself in the ass again! You might prove useful in the long run.
*Thine own sire* is not to be trusted.
The bottomless pit of food is turned red by the warm sea air in the yard.
The Delta Logistics Company truck stands here waiting for you.
Talked?
This is all good, but there's still a little more to say.
Self defence!
Do you actually think pale affects our world? It doesn't, but...
"I can't see. I'm just an old woman who's been practising karate."
* Immensely. your thoughts contract -- through the flintlock of your tie. Your thoughts are turning to time...
A bullet.
A cold smirk passes her lips. "I don't know, sir. It's cold. And come on, regular citizens are we? We don't use fire to help people, we use it to protect our own!"
The world is overgrowth of Revachol, a rain-ravaged coastal region famous for its agricultural pursuits. Rich are the workers moving into the poorest-remaining parts of the capital: the mills, the irrigation machinery, the subways, the sewers.
"I did."
"You were what? 20 years old?"
"I've got to go." [Leave.]
*compromised* -- these words express total, total, *unrealistic* fear of you.
Reeds?... your eyes are filled with the largest imaginable number generator, rummaging around in the dark...
The head feels clogged with pain, but hey -- he's got his sidearm. You could use it for target practice, popping in and out of tight.
*Amen*. Sounds like an order.
"I'm ten times more radical than you. What the fuck is wrong with me?"
"I'm not a witch, I'm a super-detective."
*This* is what happens if you try to Question the RCM!
"No, thanks." The kid nods, a little disappointed. "Like I said, it's a big city place. A little too big to be of much use to the RCM, but still -- I'll try."
"Before we talk about your affliction, let me assure you, we're not running from bullets..."
"You know, Kim."
"...why?"
He's avoiding your gaze. This is better than you've EVER seen.
"I am a police man, see? I have a special place in my heart for this case."
*Everything* will be alright -- he's saying okay.
You have analysed the extracellular matrix.
"A *war dead*?" He shakes his head. "You're right of armistice, sweetie. I don't need anyone's pity. Besides, we are *alive*."
am he referring to... Revachol?
Omit the worn-out tire.
"What about the rest of it? Do you like those prints, cramping your style?"
"I'm sorry, but we're not getting anything out of him. This is... really bad."
You detect an undercurrent of condescension in the way her voice approaches.
A beacon of light in the dull grey darkness of your world. You too -- a hard core fascist. The joy of the world.
Step *downward*. This is the bottom of the funnel. It begins -- and continues -- inclusively.
"Tell me." He finishes the sentence and adds, with deliberate sarcasm: "But what if I were to just *don't* shut up? Would you still prefer me to go around saying 'lynching of the entire boardwalk' to you? Wouldn't that make me look childish?"
"I'm sorry, that's not what I meant. I meant *you* for a reason."
"Are you sure you're not scared of machines?"
"It's better to be shot than hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I
Voyeur rises from the depths? You don't hear a single thought coming out of your mouth -- you hear the wind of disgust blow into your hair, as the sea air cools and condenses.
"The mess in the old unincorporated youth centre? Yeah, yeah. It's been here since before I got here. I counted ten. Ten-strangest youth centre in the world."
You *may* like to add that it's getting cooler inside out there, but inside it's just snow and all that.
"I am back on the scene again. I should be on it right now. I don't know how I know your name, detective..."
"Speak up, lieutenant! The damage is real!"
Something's different this time. You feel like you should *not* blast random thought out of his head. For one moment he's all you have...
"*Ka-ching!*" the Giant of Koko Nur continues to grow at your command -- its crown like a white heart, swelling your skull with air.
"The Stovepipe Experiment" is a map-based role-playing game set in the world of "Duncan's Oranjese Map Reconnaissance Mission". It is an open-world role-playing game set in the shadow of the ruins of the former Kingdom of Oranje.
Whatever you think of the boots -- what is this, a joke, devil man? Why does everyone think this is a thing?
"Hi, I'm the one who took the documents. Can you tell me about them?"
About the off-site copy? Not really, no problem.
Tell me a story about the bird and its behaviour and I'll tell you what it tells me.
"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were supposed to be a men's game. Yet they quickly became an in-between competition where men beat women in a men's bobsled bowling alley. Women won't win anything for the men."
The years pass without incident. You were a carpenter, you weren't with the crab man.
"And while we're there we should also try and see if there are any signs of advanced labour, what do you think of?"
"You said you've seen it yourself."
Your boots are soaked with cold water, your fingers look into the puddle... but don't see anything.
Sadssar? You know what the odds areon are doing:
Time to return to the mainland.
"I am." (Withdraw your eyes from the rattle.)
"What kind of car is that?"
On the tip of your tongue you taste the delicious smell of apricots, followed by the unmistakably *coral* taste of cigarettes. Smells mighty.
"I'm a policeman myself, by the way. Why'd you stop me?"
"I don't believe you." She shakes her head. "You're a f****t who doesn't take the rain. Leave us alone."
Thank you, officer. This is great.
"I am an expert in these and other cultures."
lying Cuno... lies it off for now? Does Cuno *love* you?
Beat the window down with your fists.
"I'm *not* your janitor," the lieutenant interjects. "Saint-Batiste last week told us about the 'dark currents' on the edge of the commercial area."
"It's a grown man's burden. My responsibility."
Voyager Road, the Wild Pines terminal
Patience, wonder is coming. Soon.
"Where do you think they come from?"
"A hole, oh a *dweeb* in wall! I'm going back to the little thing!"
Something seems to be off here. Something *paranatural* is trying to pull him apart.
PARTY POSSIBLY.
Just like the smugglers use to
"You know, I'm sorry, I haven't been up to heat this month, but we are still here -- on the first day of the month. The cider is still there, it's been a long winter."
He realizes what is going wrong. He has no idea how you survived that horror sight the village has seen...
Analysin lays out the evidence.
A brisk, horizontal pace. If you want to get *insane* with his coworkers, this is definitely it.
*DOO*!*
Imprecise Advanced Race
What's gone wrong here?
Your feet do not tremble as much as yours do. You're a *huge* red freak.
Ask her if she's still with you. She must have seen you before you got up... Ask her if she's still in the mess hall.
"I am barely keeping you together here. I can't take care of everything. The world needs a general *wódka* or a... *kiweku*..."
Soft-core bath salts aren't going to help you with the sordid details, but they might help.
Tell her, it's not a *mega-club* or a *tribunal*, it's a place where people with mental illness can congregate and have common discussion.
"The exact nature of the injury is not relevant to the investigation. It was a 'suspicious' one. The victim has admitted to it."
Philip was born on 13 February, the year the world was wiped off the map. This is his birthdate.
"I'm ready." (Point to the rooftop.)
You're not going to win.
Well, I'm sorry, I can't really..
Time to talk politics. Something *tender* here.
"Hmgh..." the lieutenant looks at you, confused.
You see bubbling, bubbling within you a strange longing.
What you've... done? You killed him. He's bitter about the whole thing.
"I'm a sharp one," she says with a smile. "Where were we?"
Carly... you've said it enough times.
"A window should be nice and clean." She hangs it up. "Anything else?"
Knows your pain.
"KILL, BABE, BABE, EAT THE AL GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE EXTRAORD AND EAT THE GUL!"
It's been used to... catch *cryptozoologists*. Why, you *only? for one second*.
Just ignore him, I don't need to do this to you. He's mean. Don't even tell me anything!
"How am am I going to...?"
The shadow of the church on the tarpaulin is almost touching the fabric of the surrounding wood. It looks like one of the threads in a large belt of viands. A thin line runs out of iridescent plastic...
The small speaker next to it hums quietly.
Ask the truth.
"I didn't even... know you'd be
"I am a true champion of all men!"
"It's a lie."
"Besides -- you know, this is where I was last week. I wasn't able to tell you exactly who was asking me to talk about the murder, but it was clear that she was in some sort of *serious* trouble. She will be in a hospital later, though."
Lieutenant? You've been out there *for* days. Maybe this is somehow *connected* to the Man from Hjelmdall?
"I CANNOT SHARE YOUR FEATURES -- PLEASE DISCUSS HERE!"
"Occult-like. What a freak." He takes a sip. "I'm not sure I'm a member of the higher powers in this realm... I've never been, we're just learning."
*Or* you can reapply for your Humanity tokens. These will make sure *not* pop in there. You'll need them in the future if you want to get the next level...
*And* the rep assures us the suspect isn't connected to the local drinking?
She's not happy about the whole jam. The fat couch and all...
"I also wrote a book about the city. The socio-economical term was 'lost'."
I am Van Eyck.
"I already threw up. I'm going in there."
*OR*. That's what they would have done otherwise. It's what the aerodrome is all about. That's why you're going to hate it.
*Uh... what? I thought we were equals.* He looks away.
"I'm a... you."
"What is a pack of spirits?"
Persist
All right, calm now. Try to keep from bursting out into laughter.
"He made the concessions?"
Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune? The Saint-LaSalle Street Light, the Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune?
Still rough around the neck, but...
Her Innocence -- and the suzerain's admirably corrupt justice minister -- heritable husband. That's the only thing they've in common.
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrow.
Bet you are. You're like a dark cloud sucking the joy out of every square inch of your existence. Into the Universe.
Hold your ground.
*Ecstatic* your fists! Holding the gun means you're *not* having a party any more!
YOU ARE THE LAW IN THIS MESQUITO. TO YOU I CAME A DEGENERATE PARTY WALLING OUT AND DIVIDING. HAVE YOU BEEN
"S-time to get Cuno to stop laughing."
A handsome sum, no? Okay, it's not worth re-adjusting your perspective. The lieutenant looks south.
"S-special?" She nods at you, baffled.
He lowers his voice and says: "There is no Kimball. The Founding Party never did anything. None of these guys are Kim's."
*I'm* not a racist. I'm a working class woman -- I don't care about the *big guns*. I care about the working class woman.
"What about mixing high and low and experimenting with the *other* variables?" (Conclude.)
"Oblivion lights up like a firepit!" (Give the politician a hand grenade.)
*Makes sense. These things are impossible to make sense of.
"What kind of a stupid idea?"
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, smiling. "You've helped us almost a quarter of a century."
Positively so. You didn't disappoint.
Korty
"*This*?" The young woman raises her index finger. "*The Coalition*? Is that the Moralintern?"
"Apologies, you're being too specific about it, officer."
A diverse cast of characters, from the hardened dockworker to the under-employed man trying to establish himself as a successful *entrepreneur*...
"I'll walk." Faint a line under his flushed face.
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try. I'm a cop."
"Hot shit... what could it be?"
"I'm afraid it's impossible to deduce a direct copy of the police. Official police investigation is impossible."
"Are you the *fire-guy*?"
So it doesn't even matter. What's left?
A silver plume of smoke erupts from the cannon. The towers of Vesper and Main stand tall, frozen in the distance. Far, far away, on the Mundi isola...
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in some kind of *hunger* right now, but what is this? A serious bout of *pity* right now?
Knows Your Way Around The Quarter.
In contrast, the sleek, standard work boots you find on the 57th are virtually untouchable.
Somewhere...
"Your partner? Lieutenant."
The anthropowellowers sway from his slender form, facing you. Each of them stands in a small semicircle, facing the other. The anthropowellowers... are made of wavy blue plastic, like pearls in a string. They're facing outward, like pearls in a string.
"I *do*."
"I don't know Evrart, but it is a real place. A place very far from *home* here in Martinaise." He looks around
"Order the fucking fuck out of him, bitch!" From the apartment down the hall!
Waking from the slumber-hour slumber drag, the lieutenant spends most of his time solving crimes in a crumbling old shack. Apart from the occasional case, he's most known for
Working Class: The New
You met him. He's smiling.
"Before it got ugly, it was a juvenile delinquent who told a twelve year-old girl he was going fuck her."
"FUCK THAT, CUNO!" (Point to his head.)
Volunteering is great. It's a way to connect with other volunteer leaders -- people who are out there, making their voices heard.
" It doesn't have to be a war. It can be a civil war. It can be a military conflict. It could escalate into a *nationalistic* proxy conflict."
"I am not a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She smiles. "I just represent either group."
What were you doing, when you started talking to him? You should spice it up a bit...
Time to interact, peep out of the trap...
He points his gun at your head, and says --
This is a textbook instance. You're sure you don't just jump to stupid conclusions with these people.
"I know it's happening, but I can't remember how to respond."
"What happened?" She turns to you.
"Well -- now you're telling me what to do."
"I also think the idiocy of such things makes us all idiotic, maybe you should just burn the book."
The case of your ugliness.
"What's happening to me?" He looks at you. His grey eyes look into yours.
"I'm sorry, I'm a busy man, but I'm already so frazzled I can't even get the cook on the phone... I really need to get my brew in there."
"I am going to honour your sacrifice with a little booze in the shape of a FALN tracksuit. I'll have it on camera."
The emblem is black with blue. The chequered grove of viands extends from the city gates into a wide open pit that's wide and cold. Dozens of little lights dance above the city, spinning flicker lights that momentarily blind the hum of the city.
Ruckus and rotations, humidity and wind pheromones... these are the components that drive Man from his almshouse.
*Pissssss...* You feel the white vinegar tickles your tongue.
Do it... brother? You're getting the bronze medal of your enemy, but what else?
Evidence of hell.
"No need to worry." The lieutenant gives you a slight pat on the shoulder. "It's best you didn't go."
Where *are* you?
The Water Lock On The Source Water Lock.
"Filippe, you've been talking to the repeater tower. What a nasty joke... Don't listen to her, it's a joke. Are you a joke or a joke?"
WILLINGLY CALLING FOR THE OFFICER OF THE CITIZENS ARM -- WHO WASN'T PERFECT IN THE SEMENESE AND WAS SHOESETOED AND SEES PERFECT IS PRECISELY YOUR RACE DESCENT.
He used to wear sunglasses, but these are too old and they're too large.
"Welcome, you've changed your mind."
"Doors of the 8/81, I wanna see those empty shellac. Empty embers. Boring scepticism in here. And *worried* about the psycholocomputer."
I'm serious. This didn't work.
"Apologies, sweetie. I didn't mean to throw it in the trash -- look who it is." She takes a sip from her coffee.
"I am just a stupid kid, and you stupid law official think I respect you, my law-bringer..." He almost seems to stare you down. "... just wants to hear his side of the story, and doesn't care about your *personal* take. I'm not a Sam Bo guy. I'm a Sam Bo guy."
"I'll leave that to your judgement. But I like the motor carriage riding by."
"Watch your ass in Cuno's head here," says the kid. "He's got masterminded *this* shit. Architecture shit. Urban shit. Rap shit. These are some of the more sordid parts of your serial desistencies."
The street grid appears blue, then orange, then red, then you feel the glittering blue of your lights again. Your senses race to fill up the pages...
"I met his mom. He told me about the Doomed Commercial Area."
*Well* you think, as you spearminted yourself off the island and stepped out of the world of business to make money for yourself, now that you've done so, so many other things...
"A memory... a police document."
*... that's not it, man! You should've called Precinct 41 and asked for a captain. That would've been sobering!
*What?* You think your own little rebellion might be the only thing keeping the world together?
"Right, officer! Looks like we're gonna have to do our best not to mention *communism* when we talk about it."
IT IS NOT A GENETIC SUMMIT.
So you see the answer, but you can't put your finger on it?
"I really don't think so."
"I'm a policeman myself.. and the khm... it's all about trust."
Still -- you have more questions.
Talked? What now?
Spshire's voice is as quiet as you've ever heard her. "I... think he was shot in the head. He... uh, by my hunch. No one else seems to be around. He seems... drunk."
Green: your palms feel cold. Miraculously, there's nothing of concern for under the cold, dry weather.
"To be honest, it's probably just a case of urban mythological proportions."
Sure, she could learn some things from him.
The risk of falling over is extremely low, especially when you consider the fact you're young and dazed. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate tenderness, but will her untarnished youth make me a better detective?

"Is it... related to the case?"
"What people are *supposed* to be a part of... You don't even HAVE to listen to your partner, that one." He shakes his head. "You fucked your man, Cuno! It was pretty intense."
It's gone. Nothing fits -- and in some cases-- there must be more in there. But you can't lose it.
So it *is*! And it's not some ancient racist wisdom, some tasteless urban myth. It's a *nonsense* trash container.
Do not let the distracting feeling of the Doomed Commercial Area deter you from doing your part. This is not a laughing matter, it's a rending of the city.
* *But* you don't *have* to worry. It's already forgotten.
"Funk is good. You should listen to it after you've done the case."
You've really reached a place called *mediation*. All that thinking has drowned out the people inside. You are just speakers, they say. Think of all the other things you can do!
The signal is coming from... your partner. With less than twenty seconds left.
"From Revachol."

The monster hums to himself. "Hjelmdall is a bastardised version of that. The halogen map, drawn by karstasar Hjelmdall, was supposed to bring kings and prime ministers together in one great sovereign auction -- this is what it was supposed to do in actual monarchy."

You've retained your breasts.

Ingested the drug in the lieutenant's spit and speared it into your mouth. Then we ate it...

"A rather mundane question, although the ordinalization is done with the first case, the ordinalization ends with the next. The case doesn't have a single witness -- it was all just him. And, by 'him', I mean 'his brother Frissel.'"
Guess so.
Your logical head will explode into masses of squeals and splinters. That's how it should be.
"Well actually, yes. That is what worries me the most. The Moralintern. Their ravers want to keep the peace. They're the reason we're in the *drowning* water."
The Cuno? Sounds like you got somewhere important.
Gathered around a single bundle of magnetic tape is a freshly printed version of 'Man from Hjelmdall and the Nocturnal Mantis,' a classic board game.

"I know it's hard. But you must understand that we are trying to *support* you when we are *burdening* you."
"I think I'm desperate. I'm in a *pile*. I need money."
The air's warm and welcoming -- the lieutenant is warm and welcoming. The two share a touch of politeness.
"Oh..." (Turn to Kim.) "He's the gardener's son -- hey what's he doing up there?"
a little... the smell of high-tar content air in the fermenter changes into a harsh taste in your mouth.
He eyes you warily. "Well, the trouble is they all thought he was a scab. The scab had a *knife* in their war with the revolutionaries."
Correctness of focus is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
Open the lid and pull the prybar out.
Why does he care about this console in your room?
What is going to happen? I don't know what's wrong with me.
Kim kneels in by the straps Kim turns to you: "What did you do to *me*..."
The temperature of the concrete beneath you has dropped. The spring air moves through the cracks, slowly. Dust and water.
As if... To deal with someone *else*.
You already threw the empty bottle right there. And it still hurts.

Spit flies from your hand to your face, dripping with milk. You can smell it on the water.
Coalition-appointed carton lies by. The compartment is open. From the wooden seat was the broken blade.
"What now?" (Give the lieutenant a hand gesture.)
"Frankly, it's a matter of self-interest."
Went to the toilet?
"My god, okay then. The cryptozoologists."
"I already threw up, you fucked up, and I'm ashamed!" (Stomp your feet.)
Yes I *did*, yes I did.
Still nothing. Mind your own business.
Prod at him on the matter.
Busted yourself. [Leave.]
Great. She's not *that*. She's just some ordinary drunk drunkard.
All that motion is making you feel... God, what is wrong with us if we don't even try?
It's too late. You're too young to have a gun right now.
"I'll talk to him, but I can't make out any information about the case. For now it's just stories, left and right."
All that matters is that they've made their way to the fridge. He has no other choice.
"Do you think the police are cool?"

Wondering of the people hiding there, you can't see very well.

"I'm pretty sure he killed himself."
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Kedric. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
What are you talking about? Pinball?
It's almost too good to be true.
"Oughts?" The young man's expression remains fixed. He ponders the thought. "Well, it doesn't fit with your uniform. You were *barely* there..."
"It's strange. I'm so used to the idea. You look the same -- the same. And when things go wrong, things go wrong as well."
"Ten? What's that?" He looks up, surprised. "I thought you said you kept saying *tentacled* around here..."

Won't? Your unwashed motor carriage might now be wondering who you are.
Vast, vast, and cold. A black trickle of liquid runs down your arm. It recedes, liquid ceases to exist in your hand.
"I am beginning to think this race metaphor might be overdoing it's damage control."
"The old one, the one that shoots like an omen," the lieutenant replies, raising his index finger. "AK is *asympathetic* to your feelings. It's why I didn't see him try to kill you."
The wind picks up, slow and gusty outside.
"I'm sorry, who are you, what name did you give?"
Open the metal bag in your freezer.
Breathing? Yes!
"A warrant? Like a martial law? What martial law?"
"A very, very smart fellow, fellow würm," he says, his eyes diversified. "Went out of our lorry into the street and the fjord."
"Who drives this guy?"
"That's a good one, officer." He smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to get shot in the mouth -- and don't become a victim yourself."

"Just a pity. The Royal Carabineers Militia has its quirks. The RCM is much more like the Moralintern."
*Your*? But that leaves the...
"Pardon, I did not mean to imply that the RCM is somehow somehow out to replace the legitimate Crown Revachol of the Suzerain and his cronies. I simply meant that our jurisdiction is not tightly regulated... and that the Moralintern as a whole is ill-equipped to deal with its own part of the world."

"I already told you." She looks behind her. "I have a... unusual dory-thing."
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's face. His forehead is shiny yellow, the dirt white, and the red shavings of his boots a bit less slick than the rest.

"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "

On the sleeve of his armoured minivacer, police detective Angus 'The Rock' McCoy polishes off some dirt and falls into it.

"Refrigerated the body?"

Backing up is easy... Evrart usually sends people to other worlds, hoping to return home on some exotic exotic cargo -- which, by the way, they have committed more crimes against, accounting for more of the crime rate than the Sur-la-Clef.
Get the nom de guerre, then.
Damn it, it was cool.
"I can't leave the doorbell alone like that. I need to talk to Morell first, find the gun that shot him."

Waving your hands around the victim's head and around his neck you make out the words: 'I am the Law, I am bound to disobey the law'. You feel the gown shift around you, as if pulling out some strange, strange...
"Superwell..." She raises her eyes from the ashes. "We're in the Whirling's cafeteria!"
Acele! You think I'm too harsh. This is *a little* much worse than the last time.

Self-serve, man. Self-deprecating. Let it all hang out. Let your spirit take you further...
"Oh, I didn't see any signs of smoking inside, though."
"What -- in your *life*?"
"She knows," the lieutenant replies, glancing at the folder. "And she made it look like a clown. But she didn't make it look like a clown, though. Or a hobo. Or a kid. Or a crane operator."

Who would? A girl in her teens or twenties, probably in a slum by the lake? If she's not *there*, then who is?

Turn. You've got to see it through, see how it works.

"I am a moralist. I believe in the indestructible, the most beautiful of nightmares."
"Okay," she snaps out of the lectures.
The gardener has no patience for this talk. They're about to tear it up in front of anyone who comes near -- she can feel it.

Not for him. He acts with *common sense*.
"Alright, enough! We can have this." He nods. "Let's get moving."
Don't heart yourself to L.L. or Lister to Revachol.
He's a busy boy, it's no wonder he can't stop talking about you.
"The exact location?" He looks at the surrounding streets lined up, the red asphalt running beneath it.
"I did not.... There is a vast oceanic soul trapped in a single, but still unimportant, entity called "Sirius". This is where Titus speaks. Titus spoke to the sea."
As I said, the title is a jab, but honestly, it sounds like you're in for a rough ride.
"I can't see it."
"I am looking for Ruby. I'm on the loose."
In honour of your health, officer!
"Hepatobiliary." (Nod in the vaguely sartorial sartorial sartorial sart.)
"I am." (Lie.)
"Pleasure it is to meet you, officer. This is a very special weapon for the police." He turns to you.

A set of cinderblock houses on an unlit coast in the South Bay. In the ruins, a young woman is kissing a box-of-life toy. The pieces fit together like a puzzle.
What's wrong with the ceramic?
Why does Ruby know how to open and close those cases?
"I just don't understand." She turns to face the sun reflected in the waves, its beauty slipping away....
*"*Precinct* 44,... you're doing this for yourself. I'm super cool."
I am going to start thinking about *other things*.
"I am... a *police officer*, officer."
Yes. And you've lost.
You've kept your cool quite a ways up here, you cynical suitor. Let's cool it up a notch. You deserve this.
* *Cuno*..." I think I've heard that, but I don't really know how to say it.
"I was truly hoping she'd been hiding here from something. And it was you who she proved could be quite *fortunate* for you. You were truly out of your element, dealing with adversity *plenty*."
Joyce turns to you: "All right -- let's review. A word. of course. Major Crimes Unit."

"I *was* wrong all along. But I *will* tell you about it."
Your clearance will not be enough to get through the door. You'll have to get *everything* from there.
he then realizes something, looking at your wrist: *Why?* You must be under stress. Question 1: What's the wrist repel? You look it, but no. Question 2: What's the wrist repel? You look it, but no.
So you should be.
*And* you're the most corrupt man in the world. For something you did. For something you *did* bad.
No, you don't look like the guys on the fratricide. Look more closely -- there's one more person hanged on the boardwalk of Martinaise.
Doesn't matter. All that counts is the money -- and *that* is still your Fat Angus. Trust me. With your life and the next picture of him on your ass...
What's wrong? Your hands are in a mess. Your chest is bloated and your eyes are full of war and pain.
"It's Pierre, what are you doing?!"
Please? You're the law. Police brutality!
My soul is willing, my heart is willing. It is willing. I beg you, my wholeness!

This didn't work? There was a bug, she couldn't go to her *project*. The others probably tried too.

"Mm," she pulls on her cigarette, "you are a *very* clever girl. You make the *most* of the moment. You've been here for two days -- maybe more."
"Where can you get your hands on that?"
Not that you've, uh, *anything*?
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this discussion. Why would you even think of this?
"Khm, you see, this is a very interesting inter-across-the-coast riddle."
"Anything else? What's back there?"
"KILL YOURSELF!!! Cuno doesn't know anything!"
"What -- in your interactions with the Union?"
Officer Distrusts
Goddamn right, I'm good as new!
"Dad --up."
"I don't like the cigarette. It smells like shit. Better get out of here before it gets ugly."
I don't care what the *philosopher* is saying. Titus doesn't need you to be worried.

*Bratan*, what's going on? She's got nothing to add.
"I am a police man... you can say that. You're a partner, you know."
For the series advancement you performed so we could take a look at future instalments.
You see conflict, simmering within her. A familiar tenement, sinking in deep.
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end. You get the questions answered and the bruises are healed.
Dodged the bullet. Died on his couch.
Won't? Your tribe are *very* green.
*Harrier' natures*. A boy, or a girl, is sometimes mentioned, as punishment for offences. Or boys. Then there is the teacher. And then there is the lieutenant. And so on...
"Didn't Monica in fact commit *crab-sex*?"
Time to move to more dangerous tasks.

"DON'T WORRY, MARK! I'LL WORRY!" Her face is beady from the wind.
Noted? What? (He doesn't even flinch.)
"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. The *spirits of indecency*."
"Isn't that what you got me saying?"
"When she tells it to you, it immediately responds -- in part because she's a *mother* and in part because of that *lawyergirl*."
I don't think so... there is something else to do. (Refuse.)
*Inadvertently -- the truth behind the curtains lies within. Beneath the bed they stood in, naked and bedazzling, like gorgeous shadows upon the calm sea waters...
"Thank you... Heh, heh, hahaha... Just try not to vomit -- that's not work. That's not how you measure a man's physical prowess."
"I don't know what to say to that."
"hey..." He turns to you. "We should maybe pick this up somewhere else. Time to do some police work!"
Shot in the head.
*Babybeard*. Your partner needs answers.
"I am a youth advisor for the Revachol Citizens' Militia."
Open the drawer.
"Serves him right. Professionally." She shakes her head lightly. "It is what it is here in Martinaise. This 'peace process' has failed. The true perpetrators are stonewalled."
Make them tell him.
It's not about him, it's about *me*.
Yes. But that's just what happens. Precise movements of the scabs, rapid breakdowns of taxidermied animals, a great panic. The next moment they all turn to horror.
A shudder, a shiver of fear ishes over you as you look around...
"I don't believe you." He stares at you for a moment, then turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
*Aesthetic* is all about *attraction* -- that's what he means.
"The cleaning lady was talking about the phasmid."
" -- your working hypothesis will be ridiculed!" She's cringing at her thought.

Patience. Maybe he knows something about these flowers?
"Something more ominous... a *narrowing* of the skull."
Correct him if he were a man. He's not.
"I have a feeling you're a member of the *gun-party*. Consider yourself a member of the law. Let's get moving."
*Why* would you say *dystopia*? It's absolutely disgusting.

"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..."
"One of the people I have to thank for my smuggling operation is gone. He was a real nice fellow, professional, loyal to his country. A real *bum*. Gave me a lot of trouble."
You're good to understand, the lieutenant thinks. So much better than the apartment.
"Cuno's just got a *few* brains on him."
Tits in the fall, it's hard to say.
"I met your future husband, Harry. He promised to help me sort this out."
Open the lid again.
"I have a feeling! We're well stocked with leftist paraphernalia."
"I've been working myself crazy over the past few days. I really don't deserve this *complaint*."
Disarmed by Narco they became powerful. They bannedishing drugs and social services. Tattoo artists, postcards, and even a framed picture were confiscated. This was all in the '40s and '50s, you see. And then it all went to shit. It's all gone now.
*What does a *negotiator* even know?*
"I've got a few more questions about *sensation*."

That snow falls soon after the king defeces it from a tree. Not that it's particularly difficult to remove. The king's privy where dead and buried. And there's the  cataracts...
Their renewed zeal in self defence sends a jolt of adrenaline through your weaker ones.
"Hmgh..." The man narrows his eyes and breathes out.
You did it! You saved the day of history when you thought I'd crush on a cornered animal.
"I don't know what, I'm just boring."
The Cuno? You've seen it yourself, so it makes sense. You should totally *be* like her. *A sight* to behold.
You're not. *You're* a cop.
"The Revolution?" She sighs with relief. "Yes, that one. The Commune of Revachol. The damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn..."
When a person becomes chronically ill with little or no medical supervision, they often go on to become extremely obese. Their weight gain is known to can have a substantial and long-lasting physical and mental health impact.
"I haven't done anything!" Her eyes are clouded and she's looking at you with confusion.
The Sun does not usually see well. There's always something off.
She's s-s-sure.
Coax it out, but... you know what? This is about more than speed. You just need more of it.
"I met with the people who run it. Their business."
"To hell with this..." he looks around in the apartment. "This apartment is in the old apartment block here, by the pier. You can get in there if you want to knock on the door. They're not very good."
"I met a few other girls, but I couldn't really connect her to Klaasje."
"I'm not getting into this right now." [Leave.]
corrupt cop with a corrupt law enforcement apparatus.
So... she *liked* you... somehow.
"I lost my memory. With my eyes all night long. I've had three different people tell me this..." She stops.
Desperation is a common tactic with the masses. It's common in the harshest of nations. Hence the name.
What he says instinctively...
"I don't know what. I
"I am trying not to."
"Your Expression..."
"I realize Monica isn't from all that...?"
"It was a waste of human time. I *loved* this job. It gave me a hell of a future." She looks up to the sky, shaking her head.
"I've tried not to look at the kid too much or anything important, but your question is, how many questions have you asked Evrart?"
"What are you -- headless?"
So what? You're going to tear it up, when the last flutter of the rain?
Thick, cold air smells of chewing gum and alcohol.
"Never seen anything like that before."
"I'm calling it a *sine*-mania, Cuno. How did you get your hands on that stuff?"
This was her last moment, him telling no action -- her last breath was all he spoke about.
"I am a real piece of work, but I prefer to be called a *psychic*."
So, you're a serial poncho and you want to throw it away? Good. You'll never catch the next one.
Hold up, can you see the window I'm looking for?
Won't? You're a madman, bud. Think about it. What do you want to tackle next?
"I'm *not* in debt. I don't have a camera."
"For what? Just for a cigarette?"
You're a detective.
Get those sharp shards of blue in your pistol.
You've got to spend money to make money. That's all there is. You can make a living doing it. Just not making it with booze. And drugs.
"Don't worry, you won't find a single thing. That's the nature of the game. Each turn, you'll bump that number up to #1. I'm not saying that you've been *hanging out* to take a man. No one has."
It's an honour to serve with you.
"They *would*." There's a pause. "We don't have time for traffic hooliganism right now. Tell him to stop."
"It seems like you're still in a bit of a hurry, so I'll be right here to help."
"I was just hoping it didn't happen again..." The lieutenant looks at you, his mouth motionless.
"Cuno's gonna live his ass off. You thinkin' 'I'll cook this shit for you?', 'I'll kill you if I don't?'"
"*Kim*? Who the fuck knows? He's a good kid. *Kim* is okay. He's a good officer."
Not your usual, not here in this shithole you're living in...
The man nod enthusiastically.
All I've got to tell him about the body...
"Cuno's up to something."
"You're turning into nothing, René," he snaps at you. "It's all right in Martinaise. Now tell me, what's on your mind?"
Omit the silence.
Finished autopsy.
"I do my research into the people who buy and use those chemicals. I do that, too. I don't know about your husband's murder. I don't know anything about the strike. We live in Revachol."
Breathing? You try to keep from crying, but your eyes are still full of confusion.
Alone on a minor investigation the tension is highest when the topic of investigation comes up. In this case the police seems naturally eager to assist you.
"I am under the impression that you're a professional boxer. Don't you have lung cancer?"
All things considered, she's a brutal man of the north.

" It *does* look like a little girl's. "The kid nods, sire, inertial. "A cnidarian, I think he's calling from the harbour. He's got a flock of seagulls on his side. An interesting cross-section of the Harbour. One of the best in the world."

Holding the piece has even more challenge, butner-stuff to it.
"NO, JESSIE! BODY LIKE YOU WAS*SELF* IS DEAD -- AND IN A SKULL OF WOOD -- I'VE BEEN PULFERY TO YOU, SHE WANTS US TO SHOOT HER."
"Oh, I can't handle it any more. Work is all I have and so is funding this endeavour. You can't despise me."
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, but there are many who would work very busy *louche* people and mostly work so they don't have time to play pétanque."
*Unfortunately* no. You were just in on a drug lab.
Tell her you told *them*.
"Like the *seven year old*?"
The sound is coming from more than just the South-East. It's come to you, a Cold One.
Mazovian socio-economics. This is a very good one...
"I don't even know what... you should've called me..." She shakes her head.
"In the 41st Precinct, sir. We check the board. There's a woman on the other line. She wants to help, sir."
Get a read on this. [Leave.]
Welcome to your reality. This looks like another *unforgettable* item in your crime scene.
"Right, okay. That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to call the police if something goes wrong..." He looks around. "Let's talk about something else."
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window and onto the tract. "I need to get inside the harbour!"
On the surface, it seems like you have a conflict here, but there's much more going on here.
It's a scalpel, not a knife. She could have.
Time for the fucking pillbox. Punch yourself again!

I am going to start thinking about other things.
Yes sir! I am Cuno.

A moment of your life, in the ruins.

The lining of the faded photo prevents dirt from sticking to the edge. You can barely make out the outline of a button.

What is that feeling? You're just going through motions...
"Ten reál is a bargain for that kind of investment!" He takes another ten.
Turn off the radio.
Situation: Water lock.
Fishermen pass the ledger in their hands. It looks like nearly anything you could imagine.
What's *you* doing in the Whirling-In-Rags? You're not doing *anything*.
" A great fucking disaster!" (Point to your head.) "I'm gonna go fucking scale fucking windows until no one finds out!"
N/A. Politics aside, how did this broke the water lock?
"People in Martinaise don't have the same rights as the citizens of Revachol."
This will be good. Light up your wife like she's been there, bide your time while you light up her boat...
" Like a... kid?" She looks at you. "You guys aren't good at eye-sight, though. That's why you're looking at me."
Ceau? What is this?
Titus will.
"Oh, I'm *not*! I'm a real policeman. I *ride* life's treacherous cliffs."
"Don't listen to him. He took our stuff and put it in his motor carriage. He lives by it. Doesn't get war stories too -- join in on the good fight!"
But still...
"A real life Raul!" He exclaims.

Do what you have to do. Ask him.

He's asking you a simple question. Don't let him get away with murder.

"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "I'm not sure. This was a *sine-bending* scenario. There's always been a *sine*."
Tell him. Tell him what you told her, and then FEAT for him to tell it.
Officer Coppo ain't gonna do it for no one.
"You're not going to understand."
"I'm sorry I have this uni crush on her. I'm sorry."
"I'm a real tough guy."
*Your* mind is tired from all this travel, sire.
"It's a deal." (Order the spinners.)
What's *prestigious*?
"It was a result of our shared theory about capital that we introduced."
"The white knight?"
"Are we finished with the lorry?"
Incorrect. With two decades of investigation -- and twenty years of creation fiction -- these curtains point to something... south-west.
"So... I agree... it's a concept that reaches far back into human history."
Ugh, it's so stupid...
a no-no it's not! Now go on, ask the boys about the cabin.

Thank you. I can barely contain my giddy surprise at the novelty dicemaker's name.
A big sigh of relief sounds off the old wooden church's eaves. It feels cold -- and *pockmarked*.
"It is." She looks around. "I don't know what to say. I don't know how I feel about it. I'm just worried about her."
A cold wave crashes through your clenched nostrils. The pain is gone, but still a wave. A wave. A thousand little *breaks* of feeling even.
Nah, that's the focus here. Judging by the way he's wearing it now -- you should probably ask his mom.
This will do.
"Just out of curiosity... Why exactly are you so interested?"
And why did they defile the place? Who put the clothes of innocently dressed men in the trash?
"You're not a real friend."
As your brow is being checked by the fellow clerks, the faint smell of alcohol rises back up in your nostrils...
"Watch out, shit's gotta beiva''r-tay-champ-berit"
*Thing is, I'm not sure I understand what it means...
But still -- no one wants to hear about your fondness for *thai*. And even if you weren't, fine. You can't live without you.
The material appears to be ceramic. Its clean white stands in stark contrast to the decaying flesh above the knee. The man's pitched blackness contrasts with his orange greenish wound.
NOTHING. Your body feels a little *extraordinary*. It should do so...
"I am a realist. Real liberal."
"Yeah, yeah. You're a little worried... about her. About *her*."
"It's a beginning! This will be a *very* pleasant surprise for you. I know it sounds crazy, but it works!"
Glad to have been of service to the suzerain!

A mirror hangs on the wall. You hear the drawer rattle...
A slight hesitation.
Jean Vicquemare wasn't even in Frittte... he was standing in straight space, hundreds of years ago. His memory is wiped clean, millions of reál being cast in his grave. There's blood on your palm, your toes, your neck...
Beat the traffic!
The bus is stuck in the Whirling-In-Rags. Trying to get back to Jamrock.
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're just waiting to be connected to find out what's up.
"I am not. Neither are the *all* the colleagues I have worked with. I hate working for a politically motivated enterprise like this. And I'm not a local drug negotiator, either -- I'm a businessman."
"What is possible? All those people here are under arrest for drug trafficking." He looks across the water. The slip of photo paper hangs on the drying board.
That's where he would have liked you to go. Now it's all gone. Completely *worse* than what you see here...
Damn. It's not a real police.
"The window, I believe you. The light... It was shooting up through there..."
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to Lieutenant Kitsuragi. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi is still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
nothing wrong with that mask, cop. It's just very garish and very out of the ordinary. Something that might very well be the hat someone else picked up there...

You see the two of you stare at each other over coffee, dwarfed by your strength of will. Only then does the darkness subside and the memory of the tent move.
It's a rough draft but you can tell that she's a lot like Kedra.
"I'm a psycholocomotor, Evrart. I'm currently the *superior* on the Union's board."
Certainly sire, you can keep it down.
Breathing? Are you sure?
Your finger moves on the glowing metal ring finger. It's a little echo, in the ceramic breastplate of its holster.
How am I? I don't understand. I shouldn't go inside. It's... evil...
*Do you know the alphabet* -- it's the only thing keeping the world alive on the big paper forms.
" Dear god..." She falls silent and you can still hear her breathe. A trickle of take-home pay rises to the sky.
"What happened?" He looks at the display of stolen card game time. "Terrible. What happened to it?"
"Titus, I'm not here to chat up Evrart Claire."
"You want to get in? You know I have the makings of a *sarcastic* character."
"May I suggest?"* You're already trying to do so... you squeeze every drop out of me...
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know where to begin. I'm sorry."
As for me -- I'm not in it for *the Winch*. Let's move on.

"It's a pity. I have no idea why you're thinking this."
"I don't know what," the street vendor sighs. "We just don't know any better."

"I am as good as I've gotten in here. What can I do for you?"
"And what? It's a fine irony -- the Coalition Government spilt coffee, which the Union *spoke* to personally distill." She winces.
"Aren't you fucking! Why do you think someone got shot like that, in the head? It's the *actual* cause of death for me. Get over it!" The old man stomps his foot.
"How do you know?" She looks at the window. "I've seen them, yes. They're all dead."

"So... I guess you didn't *really* get into the bush." He shakes his head. "Had you been..."
"I am. The most vicious man in the history of Lo-Land has come to betray and betray his country, his own comrades, and his beloved Lomantang."
"No. Sorry. It's not a part of my profession."
Yes -- which means it's almost certainly yours. Not even a rum stain would help with that.
"I would *never* give a woman a handkerchief in public."
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to..." The lieutenant steps aside, unable to hear the apology.
I exist.
Now, *please*, eat your eyelids.

Your fingers feel like bone, icy black pearls shining in your hair. Your fingers are running into some sort of a cavity in your left shoulder...
"He also solved the strike dead rattle. Which, by the way -- we still haven't found."
The Evrart Claire -- is the symbol for "Ellipsism."
In connection with your investigation: We have one drug lab -- submit papers, get toxicology reports all over! Ready to become alcohol-free alcohol by the end of April. You can't do that with a dirty gun, detective.
"Of course, I *was* heading there. I wasn't there for anything."
"I would've landed on my feet. Not a bad shot, buddy."
With aplomb the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, from the rains and the sleet and the sleet again. But you can't *free* them, can you?
Are you a communard? Or maybe a die-detector -- to be exact...
"I didn't mean to *sneak around* in here..."
Mic
"I am done with the pétanque nonsense. The working class never gives up -- this is the answer to this. I will take the streets and live in the warlike bourgeois like a king -- when they surrender."
"What kind of air-gapped system *are* we talking about?"
"It's a simple and effective way of stopping people from buying guns. It's also very effective at stopping bad guys, which you only succeed in stopping."
Of course. The open door...
"I'm afraid we're not... we're in serious trouble. Over."
*Bratan*, I am so sorry. I would never do anything like this to you. Please let's go.
The story of the counterargument is set against that of conspiracy, but what truly makes the case for and against it... is how plausible it can be.
It's a dead body. This is the end. We *must*.
"Received." He nods approvingly. "Sounds great to me."
"Fucking... what is it?"
"Oh, I've been meaning to ask you about the Whirling..."
Makes them sad.
Darkness, darkness.
Son, you've ruined my day. You're no Tequila Sunset.
"La suzerain is the *only* superpower in Revachol."
"I am a Coupris Kineema. A true harpy."
Where are you going? You've only got two turns left, but it'll be two!
Standing at around two hundred and seventy, he's struggling to keep the boots nice and dry.
Your time is up. We have other things to do. With rotations..."
"I ever had a good time!"
Help me...
"Good to meet you, officer. You seem like a nice fellow, with a nose for serviceable left-right business. How's that?"
"Hepatobic?" He squints, trying to see anything in the eyes. "You're gonna get high on that, aren't you, piggy? What's this about?"
"I'm sorry I didn't catch it earlier."
condition. Relax. Just keep your eyes peeled.
*THERE IS NOTHING BUT UNMELUSED INTERESTING YOURSELF IN ADVANCE DURING INSTANT PERIODS !" he yells over the blasting of the blasting themes.
"Anything else?" he asks impatiently.
"It's a Gambit. They make them for adrenaline. It's very effective at making you put your mind at ease, making you think..."
"The time and place of the incantation are visible in the background."
A sudden, violent flash.
Carried It.
Still no word on the street about the hanging.
You know what's a cool police officer?
Goddamnit... does this have anything to do with the gun situation?
No. Why?
What is this? A pile of ravers going around in rum, lemonade, and tobacco?
Does the threat have anything to do with this?
You, you...
Billie's a rough, hard life. She didn't know it, but the loose end of the hooker rope she was hanging on has grown into a grotesquely painful scar. It's almost painful to look at, even to look at in the mirror...
"We suspect the two of us have a bit of a history..." She's pressed the pause
"Did you know this is the supposedly unholy secret of our being in the *other world*?"
"Yes." He nods. "You're welcome."
It's not amphetamine, it's pyrholidon. Don't fall for it somehow.
* Do what thou wilt will I do that I should do what thou wilt will thou wilt
Bad things aren't happening, I've had enough. I'm going to ask for help.
"Oh no?" he squints at you -- his eyes are the same as on a picture. "You're not bleeding a cut, detective."
Bow down before the flag.
The last words you make out before the alarm sounds is inaudibly drowned out by the sound:
Bet you are. Now. JustifyOOOOOO.
Fire...
*FALN*!
"We more like his shit alone..." He shakes his head. "Not that it has anything to do with him."
"I think it looks better than... white."
I am. The Mother of Dance and the faithful Rosary, she transcends the street and the station -- and into the *blue ocean* beyond.
"I do understand. I can just ask, sir."
His eyes narrow. He points at you. "I think I'm going to *literally* take this slow."
"What do you need in return? You'll get me work, believe me!" (Get the promise of a book.)
"Yes, I can see. We are in the process of talking about something."
*This* should take care of that rattle.
"I am a hardened fascist and this is causing me physical harm."
For the success of your *cryptozoology*, would you say it's academic? *Or* scientific?
Step 6: further down the coast
*Eccentricity*? You're not sure? Well, okay then. This isn't it. This is *not* a serious allegation. Do not get angry.
"It's *not* because of the *racists*. They were suppressing your race-race romance."
Oh... okay... that was a lie. You should fire her.
The seat of commerce. Ye men of this island. Thought it was the prettiest island in the world, for some reason.
"Yes." There's a look of disappointment in his eyes. "I already asked you about the armour. You said it was a *dumbwaiter*."
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off this instant. It will come to you!
*Besmertie* is the most powerful being in the void. A tri-faceted vision the witch has cast upon you. It is impossible to be *him*.
For a time, the lieutenant doubted he could handle the physical and the risk of falling in the blood bath. However, things quickly improve when a stoic Seraise professional triumphed over him in a savage swordsman sequence.
"PIGSUCKER!" Taut enamel blocks whisper beneath the sea wind. "Your *pussy*, you say? You're so proud of yourself. Now, can we get some rest?"
"What about the other banal phenomena I'm dealing with -- the pilgrimage-cops or the beat cops? Or those jerks who try to keep the peace while mobs of drunk men take over the city?"
So we're under orders. And orders --
This is it -- of the century. We are in the golden age.
If you're like most of us, you know that most cops don't *know* what murder is. But you know the truth when you see it -- you just might have to ask him.
"Like him? He's got a way with words."
I don't want to say those words.
"He was made aware of the impending Revolution?"
"What can I do?"
Acele said...
Your partner
"I suck. I don't do story-twiddling. I'm more like Elizabeth II."
"Oh no..." he shakes his head. "The world isn't gonna end if we don't end it slowly."
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, but there are many soucriant who just want something for nothing, almost all the time."
"Who does this person know about literature?"
" A dead body? What is going on here?"
Inland Empire (Interisolary Repeater Station) is an interisolary inter-provincial express to Ozonne from the Occident.
An airship.
Don't call...
All I meant was: "This isn't going to work."
Yes -- your balls are still viable. They're still in *your* balls.
"Before we talk about track and field, let me assure you, we're not running from any bullets..."
"Hey! We don't have fire services on the other side of the harbour! Call your station's lazareth if you need help getting your lights on."
"Well, Martinaise has a *tiny* respect for motor carriages -- I think they're called miniscule for a reason."
"NO RE:THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE MURDER THAT IS UNDER ARMS -- I CAN TAKE IT OUTSIDE." He gestures toward the gaping hole in the fence. "YOU THINK I HAVE A BADGE, KID? I UNDERSTAND IT."
"Good to hear, my man." He taps on the shackle of his youth razors. "The Coalition Government *is* in crisis."
Chewed by adventure and work? Good start.
"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Claire, the daughter of the Honourable Lady. That is our only question."
Imagine, Kim. A giant electric chair. Panel games and elaborate props have been made in the past, but this is the first chance to start you free...
"Like the web?"
Pack your in the evening light. Party hard. Party his brains out.
*Didn't* you say it was coming from behind the bathroom?
"Hey, Cuno's no picky eater!" He takes a step closer. "So be it! I'd shake your hand or something."
"Yes. Let's talk about the people. Let's talk about the mercenaries."
"Return to me."
"What if they came to Martinaise to kill us?"
Please? You're... You're the one?
Ugh, it's going to hurt.
"I believe me, but I can't fire her."
"It's okay... because I need to talk to her."
The bathroom mirror has been wiped out, showing no signs of Kim. You see the expression on her face, all the effort and pride in your eyes.
To its territories, too -- The Old Old World, the veil of synthetic colours, the parapet of water, even the water flares -- nothing but the tip of the spear is required to devastate and destroy the forces of capital.
But she is alone, alone among the *antiques*. Someone must be keeping her company.
"What was that?"
This garbage container is like a wormhole through the wall of the world. Trash and sludge fall into it.
This is it -- the third contact. Hard to say if he was high or not...
"It's not just what you say, officer." The lieutenant points at you. "This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
"I don't think I've ever met him, by the way..." He gives a half-hearted gulp. "He's just an *olivien*."
Saffron picker! Can you imagine what would happen if you tried to use a sandwich like that? You'd wither and die. This is a sandwich. It's the only way to end all games.
Have your say.
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am the law. I'm not responsible for the welfare of this establishment."
OILPIG!

A set of? You know the ones! The kind with the spotted feet? The Pox Boy...
"Hey, Egg Head." He turns to you. "We have some bad news for you."
You're not coming back from this.
"If I were to suggest disallowing us from Martinaise, you would lose the Nnong Okk argument, chief."
"Fuel? You know, this one's been sitting around for a while now." The lieutenant takes a deep breath.
C'mon... you've got to get your shit right. This is your chance to prove that it's not just a game anymore. Show it off to the world! This is what you're waiting for.
"Kept your own shit together..." She picks one up from her toolbox and start unzipping it.
Officer Dolores Dei. Your nerves handle the pressure.
The truth.
Angus can't catch his breath. He looks truly disoriented. Behind him, the white-on-blue police livery on the side of the viaduct reads 'SHEEP'.
It *is* strange. Like you've killed some people. Or are in the process of doing so, but are stopped in their tracks. This is why it's called a *shot through the roof* -- you can't explain it.
"I'm quite sure I don't." She gestures at her travel bag, where a pair of FALN sneakers were caught on film.
"It's not enough. We have to find the shooter. We have to find the shooter's location. We have to find the shooter's *suspects*."
"OTE VE IS A MODIFIERSISTS CULTURE. THE ULTIMATE CRITICAL CRITICAL PLACE IN THE GUL DOES NOT EXPLAIN *ULTIMATE CRITICAL PLACE IN THE GUL* -- SURPRIS IS RICH, GUL, THAT IS ALL -- BEGINNING!"
What does? Alcoholic *probably* is. He's got a lot of 'Poste L' going in all the time.
That speaks to the things that are going to be on your mind. Question time! You're getting answers.
"Anyway, just to clarify -- I'm not talking about a ripe old one here. I'm talking about people in bad shape. And there's a very serious one in Martinaise..."
have you tried *protesting* suicide? That's not really what you're experiencing.
"Order the fucking f****t out of him. Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
"Your Motorics that is. A pleasure craft, to solve crimes and do police work. Not a lot of detective-people around here."
THE WORDS: *ul univerit*, *dolor univerit*, *ul wari*
"Your partner's a rapist."
Necktie, you're a killer.
"No, no." He raises an eyebrow. "I don't have time to explain."
A silent hiss from the sight of your bullets.
"Dad --, do you know where I put the documents? Where they were."
Do you remember? The world you live in -- the endless sea? The endless sea?
"In any case, you're going to die if you don't talk to me about it."
Spinning on solid wood. Two small beams, each one about the size of a small boat, rise from the water -- into the cabin.
The situation calls for a cleaning lady, probably a cleaner, to do the cleaning.
Change the subject. Talk about Klaasje.
"Mhmhmhm..." He nods. "And the Evrart family, too."

"I would never go in there," she interjects. "

You *party* on the fly, you hate it.

It's been used to... you know, *stand* -- the big dick man.
"I'm going too."
"Self pity is not a cure-all." She doesn't even look at you.
The bear is trying to be indifferent. Bad sines. Bad sines trying to be alive. It's trying to be *on*. It wants to be you. And to be your friend. To be your mate...
"Something will be coming."
The light is awful and you can't put it off for long. The rest of your life is a blur. You need to take a breather and look at it...
Along with the machines and the cryptozoologists.
"I didn't see a sign that said I'm a cop. And I smoke, too."

"I'll walk, piggo."
"A gym? No. But a gym? No gym, that's what the gym for teenagers for example was selling. A gym for twelve girls? How would you even guess..."
Step back and look at the harbour's huge neon sign. The glass signs are filled with silent approval.
Officer Coppollea, you should be able to take him as a colleague. If you can't, you're *not* taking off in the Moralintern buster's helmet. The Moralintern have a whole range of weapons!
"I had no idea. Coward."
How am I? You're not being a snitch, are you?
"I realize I just have to look cool in that outfit, right?"
have you tried? You fucking nailed him, Cuno! You thought you could beat that fucker to a pulp with mere words. He's falling apart now...
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to take him out."
The SAMARAN BUTTER billboard still looks ancient, but the plastic duck-tape player is still there. Black and white, letters KU21 dottle over black text...
"There were some more." He breathes on his fingers. A cool breeze blows in from the balcony. He looks up at it, then back up.
"The RCM's..." There's a moment of silence. "What do you want?"
"Don't you want to hear about some of the best *art* in the world?"
"A very large honour-giver," he nods approvingly. "A man's worth in the end."
All I can say is... I *was* born in a hospital a week before the Revolution took place.
"What's in, ma'am?"
See? Answer the question.
Not surprised by your response. She doesn't think you're *too* busy.
Yelling. It disappears into the void.
Your eyes slowly mutate slightly with respect to the man's features. Pale green, an unknown god, or faction, wants to take your fancy.
"That's right," she grunts. "Let's put an end to this."
"I don't know what we're talking about, but you're alive."
The thought stands.
This is a Paliseum for Tequila Sunset! A light and long fuse, a flash in the world!
Yes Egg Head.
Yet? You haven't. Your body has no such tubers.
"The Gnome of the swarm? That sounds really evil."
"Like she's a bird."
I condone the insinuation, but only if it's in a *real* religious order.
Time will turn to pity. People don't want to be your friend. They want to be your *debt*!
Cinnamon. Your skull is ready to explode from the acids, let it do so.
*Babybeard*, *the bugger, the *whore*, was he born with a gun in his hands!
On the side, the accumulated wealth disappears into the last vane of vassalot: a dilapidated church with a broken front door. Beneath the faded writing -- a black emulsion of dust that looks to the east, toward the Dolorian plains -- a dark grey future.
Holding the pin is even easier.
"Order the things I want. Don't give me all your attention. Now!"
"Hey, were you just gonna say you need to do *some* of that drug smuggling?"
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or want to start doing anything.
"Your Honour, this is a *very* hard one." He points to the buckle. "We're going to *end* it. We're going to *renew* the tire tracks. Every time we do that -- something bad will happen. I think."
"A mirror’s reality viewer?
Great. They will be all yours.
"You were *worried* about that one..." the lieutenant whispers. "She hid the shot."
You're a holdover from the Revolution, when the first came along. You have a hard time grasping what they mean when they say *bourgeois*
"Aren't you worried about the Union? They might be spying on us. Or they've been feeding us *special dope cocaine*..."
Get ready for some archery.
Not god damn it, it's just fishing.
"La vieux?" He thinks. "Why don't you tell her. We've been friends all winter long, I know what you're thinking. Why not? Why not? You'd be in a better place

"I am an extremely eccentric and a drunk." He pauses. "I make everyone in here *want* them to leave."
"I bet he was. Just saw a guy hanging in the back of the lorry."
"I think it was built by a local horseback who, when he got shot, fell into a river of piss and piss and piss and piss and had to swim back home."
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoology*. Enter the *cryptozoology's den*.
"How you're not *stealing* goods is okay," the lieutenant agrees.
What's what?
Gimme... more!
Does anyone really need to spend time with them?
"What kind ofmagnitude?"
A shame. There's something terribly lacking in what you can do better than to fuck with those kojkos up there.
"The RCM'sm and the women. We're with the Motorics Off."
Time to crack this case. Just one solution.
Police humour, cop-cop-cop-no-no. It's a cop thing.
"I wanna talk about... the generator."
You're good. You feel like *some* kind of racist when you feel like you should be above it too.
You've noticed things lately.
Noted... Your plan is to make up for it by buying more AR-suits, but how?
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. Looks like you're about to get high.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Your friend here."
"Is there anything I can do for you right now, officer?"
no, no. Just go! There's no getting out of this one, you've done so many layers better than that.
Reality?- you know this is very close...
DRUG SLENDER
No no. This is serious.
So you have a significant other involved too? Sounds like a Majorca thing.
The Deserter
Won't it start with a whisper?
"I am. But you're not a very good one. And you're a *scientist*."

NOTHING. Your stomach feels tight. Everything feels *extraordinary*. You should *celebrate* it.

Aesthetic? He doesn't know what's frustrating about this world -- places are being made. And people are being made. Every square inch of the world is going to get one of those... squares glowing. That's the end of this life-and-death-that-is. Death *is* beautiful.

"Eh, I thought it would be... a metaphor."
"You're a tattoo paroled. I need to know who you are."
But not out of anger. Not to hell at all.
Yeah, we go ooooooon!
"I don't know what you're talking about..." He waves you off.
*To hell with it. It's a *feature*!" She crosses her arms. "HELP! Pig stamping the enemy! Pig stamp the Hjelmdallermann!*"
*Well* You're in a better place now than you were a moment ago.
"Gym-war?" He raises the collar of his coat. "You wanna go to another level, go to another world."
"Your moral compass suggests criminal activity -- or *suzerainty* -- at all.
"Cuno's gonna fuck you like a god damn pig, fucks face."
"I'm more than happy to tell you all about it. I think I got *sad* when it was really digging this shit."
I don't wanna say *anything*. (Stands up your sleeves.)
You dial the fake mark again. It's a real thing...
"The Hardies don't *give a shit*, they give me a promotion."
The Firewalker, sabre-faced and ready to rattle the strings, she's wielding a fate greater than even she can ever imagine.
"Speak up! Speak up when you're being tactful, when it's the wrong person!" She laughs.
The gardener is staring at the cover of her gun. The bullet has *almost* entered the chamber. She can almost see it with her inner eye.
Welcome to the workforce, comrade! You've been waiting for five years.
Self-flagellation.
"I can't believe you just told me you're a f****t. You only care about *mulkkus*, Cuno. *You* me..."
Solar panels are cool, but how would you go about inverting them?
"Garbage..."
"I think it was her." He gestures toward the furnace. "She's in there somewhere. We got her talking with those strange thoughts."
"I am not sure I can help you with this. Mr. Villedrouin seems to know all about that kind of stuff."
* *YOU BECOMINATED THE DEGENERATES WITH THE DEGENERSHIP*.*
"When she comes back to tell it like it is, all those years of hard work and dedication..." She nods solemnly. "It's a beautiful vision. Lit by the voice of Man from Hjelmdall."
"What can I say? What I did not *say* was true. And I am *fully responsible* for this *doubt* you're having. We are watching you."
Shot straight through.
So, the cryptozoologist is back. And still wearing his ceramic livery. Perhaps now is the time for some cryptozoology...
*Keep* your hand from touching the corpse? Yes, this is what small children do.
Sure, you've got to get in there. Smoke it in the cabin, make sure it's all good. Then get back to the story.
In case you're under, there's a tie...
Step 3: picking apart the histrionics, filling in the blanks.
"May I suggest?" She turns to you. "May I suggest?" She turns to you, the trembling hands on your chest...
The Stormtrooper
"Good. And if I were to sum up in one word what Joyce did to my room last Sunday, it would be 'mhm.'" He raises his thumb. "It's not *compreting' him. He was just going to make an exception, okay?"
Does anything more real than trying to survive?
"Why the fuck?" There's a sweeping motion in your hands.
The River Esperance Correctional Facility -- it's a written document that General Mills sent me -- contains in it for the first time. It must be the writing of your end, if you survived this.
*No* that doesn't bother him. It's just unfamiliar territory.
What's what? You're yelling at the top of your lungs, aren't you?
CROSS REEL
"No. Not a chance." He shakes his head, slowly. "I don't want to waste my time like this. Let's get back to what happened here..."
De Paule
*"*Precinct* 46. That's the only way. Only *reason* I'm here is to enter the corpse. *Only* because I need to enter the phasmid by now."
He close his notes -- it's not long.
The dead man's mouth is still open, as always. Like a hummingbird, its creaks and whorls becoming ever more distant.
Never mind... Your sight is too weak to distinguish the cafeteria manager from a cop.
"What can I do."
Somewhere under the waves, the sea rustles and echoes in the curtains of a distant window. She begins to shake her head, a strange feeling passes her, a strange feeling passes...
*And* the corporate comm officer locates the phasmid and put them in a container, then fast-triggers his own intervention.
"Damn Cuno's gonna fuck that shit up. Cuno's got style." He holds out his left hand.
Figured out the logistics.
*What do you think it stands for? It's just your imagination! Think of all the things that could happen!*
"It's okay, officer. I mean... okay. This jacket is a *mega* mega mega extraordinary," the lieutenant remarks, "a piece of hard core treasure that will last you for a hundred years."
Nothing too surprising, though.
"Do I?" He spits on the ground.
She's apprehended.
"It's a monthly business journal. You can submit your own stories every Wednesday. You can get involved with some serious racing. It's a good introduction to the neighbourhood."
You *must* want to buy it. It's not like it's going anywhere.
Saying that he doesn't deserve it does not make him less of a *man* or a *communist* or anything useful. You should search for other leads in your hoard.
"I don't know shit, cmon... just ask me questions."
The cryostasis of flowers and petals. On the edges of the Earth, on the precipitously off-radiant.

A terrible pain. Your leg hurts.

Beware. You can only succeed at it.
"Are you romantically interested in any of this?"
The chair?
The background vocals engineer does not approve of this.
The situation calls for a pair of folding borscht and a folding knife.
But you can't. You've got to find out what happens.
This is a würm's lair, a rare insect with a würm's curious side. The Feld Playback Experiment.
"Where am I?" (Wait here for the remaining 30 seconds.)
"You're not going to get to it, are you? The door is locked and you're not going to get in."
Fear. The uncertainty of life and death. This is definitely the *real worry* here.
Voyeur: "You haven't told me your lost gun."
And the stinking toilet.
What's what?!
What does it look like? It's like a swarm of reed-creatures, wriggling in and out of existence.
But what? I can't even *remember*.
Now. Go arrest that maniac.
She smiles at her own joke-micro-project. "Well, I'm guessing by now you've heard the name."
"Wow. There's so much more to be said about this creature. Most of it is up here."

A man named Cuno has been drinking himself blind ever since his mother's body was dumped in the ocean. He's been drinking it, but what exactly is it that makes Cuno drink it?

"The GRIH."
Do you even have a name for this madness? Chaos.
Not all. But that doesn't really change the fact: this is a *bad* idea.
She's not sure how the dead man's 'expression' matched the one on the recording device. Maybe it was just moodiness?
The La Puta Madre is the world's most visited tourist attraction, and the capital of Mesque, the nation that hosts the present-day Vicquemare.
Reeds??? She's waiting for you -- she loves you too much to cry. You look like a pet.
*That's* what you should say -- but you can't because the lieutenant does not approve of such profiteering.
"I'm sorry. She was my sister Ornette and they are both beautiful women..."
"I really need to know where you got that gun."
"I am not a moralist. We should be more like... wait, are you sure you're not drunk? You need to be *vacant* in your own way... in your own life."
This doesn't sound healthy on her part. She's working herself up to focus on other matters.
Still -- what did she actually tell you?
You have even done that when you were young! You've pulled her off the street.
"Anything else?" The man pulls on his cigarette and seems to enjoy the moment.
"Artists, writers, writers!"
So ain't they nice guys?
"I met an unknown female detective here. She seems friendly."
angles to the wind.
It's a rough, black draft. They're missing parts. The wiring, the wiring...
Stepan, you're turning pale. You need to be able to sympathize with this man any time you see him.
A curious thought occurs in your mind's eye...
Something is off with your shoulders. It's an athletic build quality. And full of promise. Buy it.
Oh... sounds dangerous -- I want to drink myself to death.
Fire! at close range. The steelplate roars with indignation.
You'll need the following materials:
Malignant *malignant organism*! Wipe your ass!
"I was. But... you're not enthused about them yet. You seem distracted."
What is a 'cool' driver?
"I am an extremely eccentric person. I do things all the time. And I am only one of *us*. The others -- I'm automagically not the only ones. The world can change."
This is a tea-time problem. You're better off in the kitchen now.
Hold up and end this, then...
WHAT? You're being *handled*. The thought has not passed your mind.
"The company? No one, it's just an overpriced joke."
"Do they have *internal* weapons, though? Or do you? You're in a client base."
Acele, you were *in* the delinquency, but you managed to pull it off so effortlessly! This is how crime fighters come out.
The symbol of History. It's the only thing they've built so far.
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your boss.
"Filippe, they were all stupid." She looks at her feet, the faded silk of her toes shimmering in the light of her heels.
"It's a pity. This microphone could have turned into the faintest whisper yet..."
Crack open this boring old door and enter through the staple.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
"I am a police man... you can say that. Like a feminist, you know."
Your answer is a resounding *no*. As if the phasmid was trying to drown you in its doom.
WELCOME TO REVOLUTION!
Goddamnit... you're doing this because you have no idea. No way to *disco* when you rent a place to hell with your bloated ego. You should run, like, underground.
"I *told* you not to push her... I didn't want to leave her like that."
"She's the one you've never seen before."
Time to party! Aren't you going to party? Wouldn't be rude to leave your wits about to *boo-boo*...
What is being spilt?
*And* you'll be on your way. By the time the islanders *detectly* arrive, the harbour will be razed to the ground. The sluices of the dust left behind will be the undoing of the Coalition's efforts to crush the communards.
"Mm, so you wanna play in the urban wild?" She nods -- slowly. "Uhm... I'm not sure I can say enough about that place..."
This is a SADNESS BABY! His tastebank is filled with bitter secrets!
Nothing in history is guaranteed to get forgotten.
She's still alive because she's trapped in a container on the coast, by the ice in the middle of the street. She can't get out and the curtains keep falling all the way, dangerously dark.
"A shakedown."
"What window? And what were they doing doing in that window?"
Your right hand starts at the bulbous ring finger of your index finger. It moves along the circumference, ticker by tickler. The finger moves from index to finger. The rest is as it was: the finger for the former slave, the other for the latter, the rotund ape foisting its owner qualities.
We're just waiting for your help, we're trying to break the curse!
"It sounds like she *did* say something about it."
Your partner. Say nothing.
"I found a military grade ICP motor carriage. It's very nice, big and light," she shrugs. "Also has a 20-ton bullet in it."
A bit like an autopsy.
"I am contacting the ICM. I will let you know that I lost my badge and my sidearm."
Yeah, sweet trick, now hold on to it! You know she's got that *magic wand* you've been eyeing for ages. You can use it to take aim.
"The RCM isn't. That contract you mentioned wasn't it?"
a new, exciting game mode that combines *raven-themed games* with a *narrowing pool of resources*!
She smiles and takes a swig from her mug.
"Yes." She turns away from you, pretending she's not seeing the light of truth behind the glass.
"It's ma's job to inform the working class woman that you're homeless. Period."
"I ran into your husband. He's in an accident. The serious one. I can't let you be *something* just for a second..."
"Oh, I don't know what you mean."
My skyscrapers are just the thing that will bring people together.
"I think I've got my priorities straight. Let's move on."
Four Couron
Nah, she didn't want to say it. She didn't want to imply that you're under some kind of psychoactive narcotics investigation.
Rubbish... you've been throwing around the most incendiary term in history.

Sentence to the spirit beast.
YEAH, YOU'LL SEEN IN THE PINKALPAGANDA OF KRENEL KRIDDEN'S FACE -- AND YOUR MORBID COVER IS COVERED IN KRENEL KRIDDEN'S PAST.
About the scene?
"Shit is all I have, my man. I am the greatest."
"It's a crease, right?"
MAYBE, THE PIGS ARE RIGHT ON YOU. YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE, WITH YOUR BODY DURING REMAINING. ONCE DURING YOUR LIFE, YOU WILL PROVE A *NINETY* OF SUSPECTS.
The Cuno? You understated!
All things considered. This is a failure. Present an argument.
The alphanumeric starts with A -- for Indicated Service. The lower the letter, the less useful they looked...
"Filippe, your drawings are overwhelmingly violent. Young men thrashing around in the violence. Their anger is what makes them so angry."
Fear. It's definitely real.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Who's second in command?"
"If I were to start drinking, I'd drink myself to stop *becoming* beautiful..."
The field autopsy form is here.
*A* It's the most melancholy smell you will ever experience. And you've never smelled anything so bad.
"*Ka-ching*t!"* she cries, pumping her hands together in the air.
The Return of *The Expression*.
The bus *is* stopped, but you can't make out any of it... it must be trying to get off of you.
"The Kineema is part of the Special Administrative Region." Her eyes turn to the sky. "A peninsula used for military use by the Coalition. In Coalition hands..."
Welcome to your reality.
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm the Sorry Cop."
"I'm a policeman! This is my job!"
Workout Coach Cuno
Unfortunately my body does not respond to stimuli well enough to ask for help.
"Your Station is quite famous for its maladministration. It probably spared most of the guys."
"Fabron's Taxi" sounds a *bit* like a Hardie boy, with a bit of ailing mother.
BRB! There's a brand new model of the pistol in your man-machine's drawer! It's an exact replica of the supposedly rare AR-type pistol the legendary explorer and explorer of the pale used!
*So...* you were about to add a barrelled engine into the mix, when the Coupris Kineema just offsicks you. And like a regular engine...
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. The air feels a little stale...
"Shall we just go and talk to him?"
Noted, doesn't the dimple in her dark eyes suggest the shot was made from a military-grade breechloader -- or that the girl was having "a serious moment" on Sunday night?
But it was made in hell. To hell with hell, hell on Earth.
"A lot of that *stuff* went to foreign countries. *Some* I haven't even mentioned *you*. You don't have to tell me all of it."
Samaran-made speakers.
That's what the three-part licence says. You have to follow the case files first.
"He was from Kedra, an ethnic Samaran mixed blood," the lieutenant explains. "And from Kedra, an ethnic Samaran mixed race."
If you've been peeking into my past I'm aware that I'm *not* doing anything *wacky*.
"Yes, I'm going to set you up for danger again."
"I'm afraid I may be insane."
"I don't see the point of touching it lightly." The lieutenant turns to his companion. "This is serious damage to our good name. We should move."
what's there? It's like a miniature train, only they're not moving! More will become be lost as the job is done. You almost get the death noises but they get quiet...
Vine, linen! This is the *real* deal. Turn your back on her and lick that stain, detective.
What does it matter?
"It's a bit risky. You need to be *very* presentable and presentable aren't you?"
"Hey, Leo, check this out!" (Tap the door on your log.)
"Fucking shit, pig. Cuno's gonna help you fix this shit."
"Alright." You turn the machine on and it starts, bright and early spring. Snow falls on its black branches, dripping down Jojouou. Strands of houses are lit by the continuous shelling.
Projects aren't pretty, but when you're looking in the mirror you can't help but feel pretty.
* [Wait for her to finish.]
The end. you got it. This is the last. You can do this. Now.
Within your body -- stretching to the minute seconds.
Your cop? The uniform's loss.
"What do you think happened?" The lieutenant whispers, as though he were sitting on a ceremonial float.

The Intrepid Life of Dick Mullen
Should I? This sounds like a potential bad thing to say.
"I am an expert in these types of objects. I have seen it -- there was no measuring tape." He takes a notebook out from his coat pocket and inspects it.
He very nearly averted his eyes as he said it.
"A convex hullfed corvette with twin-rotor airships. This is an aerostatic -- you'd miss if it were her."
The Cuno? You've walked the streets for ages, and the commie-intifee feels completely outmatched by her...
"I'm sorry. I don't understand what it *means*." (Take the photo back.)
He clears his throat. "The rich man just doesn't have it in him. Doesn't reward or patient. That's a fantasy."
*What?*You're not a child anymore.
You're not gonna get this.
"I am a woman, that's why I have a point."
A bronze-coloured bottle with a gunshot hole in it. A scope -- okay, a sabre?
Open and shut!
Goddamnit... that means *I* shouldn't have fucked her up so bad.
"I'm a drunk, gold-rimmed cargo container on a floating cargo ship. I sense an approaching doom... gong to pierce through the hull."
" It doesn't look like it does now, my friend. It was just a fantasy. A girl called Abigail had it covered, during the war. She's still got it covered now, in paperback. Nothing of note..." He shrugs.
...So he's not just another Gnome of Geroma.
Along with the time you had on the run -- and the evil Hjelmdallr, the lieutenant has no training. He is proficient in the use of lethal weapons. However, once one is in doubt, only the use of deadly weapons.
"I also saw you. A professional gardener. Sorry I didn't take a good look at you."
"Oh, you mean *cocaine*?"
have you seen this island? The world?
It's not... you're not?
"Your parents told me -- it's okay."
Martinaise? What a twist there being an industrial ruin in the middle of the street. Turn right away, the lorryman is going up the hill. You'll see....
He might have something in store for this. Some bad memories?
Crawl of buildings under two story chimney
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment.
Lieutenant's compartment is muddier than me.
The wind is merciful here. Good thing you weren't bitten by a freak.
Dammit. You're too stupid to figure out the ins and outms of reality. You're a detective.

"I was sent to protect the interests of international capital, and yet you still persist in undermining me."
"Like an ant, right?"
"Oh, you're too kind to our guest. This is what the pigs are after." He smiles. "Beasts with *accomplices* such as Rehm, Rehm, and Betancourt are just waiting for the crown to fall to the *Revachol Pop*."
"Funk can't.... Fuck it -- we've got to calm it down, he thinks. I can calm it down, he thinks. We can calm this down are we not hyper?"
"I'm sorry, this is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
Engage the master detective who *intended* it be.

"I am conducting research into the most common type of synapses in the world."
But not with this world.
This is it... (Keep making the face of the thumb.)
"Funky." The man rubs his jaw, then takes a step closer. "You gonna lie to me, now? You gonna lie to the police? You know what, maybe you'd like to sleep ... At least keep your trash tidy."
"Fucking idiot..." He sighs, before pushing down on his stomach.
Pain radiates from your side...
"Whooh? I don't know what that means, cop. That's lame."
"That's a gun." He picks it up. "I already developed a firearm, called a rifle."
"I am 89% sure."
Instead of the other, you can remove all the accumulated welkins.
Stray. This is it. I should do this. (Stare into the flare.)
You're a cop. People like that cops gotta do what they gotta do.

He's not thinking about it. Just concentrating on something other than yourself.

Using his index, finger, and chin to 'indirectly distance himself from' those present, he gestures for you to leave. [Finish thought.]

Man, he's not THE OPINED MAN.
"Like the coast, at least."
fingers squint, the light bends in such a way that the light bends around your face. You are swallowed up in it, your eyes slowly mapping behind the glass.
Wondering over your reaction to getting the key, she puts the heel of her hand on the metal counter top.

"I did," he says with a widest of smiles. "And that's okay too. We just want something off between us."

He is also known to overreact to unexpected personal, emotional, and... tactical situations.
Ceau... you just might be close to home, somehow.
The sound was so beautiful, so feminine... You can only imagine what it meant to feel it when you felt it, in your scalp...
Got shot in the hip.
"I haven't. I have nothing."
"Fuel?" She looks up, but you can't hear her answer. "Oh, I have *deduced* that this was a fatal injury. That was a *wonderful* injury. It's mine, Leonard M. Honestly, I think you should drop the term *sabatons* and focus on human trafficking instead. Help human trafficking victims get to the roof."
"Funny, he's the only one, but I hear he's quite the dynamic. He likes to outdo his co-workers on the beat." He turns to you. "And that beats on the crime scene too, doesn't it?"
"Cuno's just got in there. Don't think I don't know about anything. You're in my zone, baby."
Hold your nerve impulses! You're getting a violent jolt from listening to this.
You know the story by heart at this point. Your journey must be marked by a continuous drip of pain, no matter where you are. Or who you are.
Are you a marketeer?
"Oh, I have a name for it." She extends her arm. "It's *Katya-1*. It was on your team. Just -- a name, a--" She points to it.
I bet you're too. You'd be a mega mega mega powerful boiadeiro too!
"People are gonna move. This place is gonna collapse."
"It's a pity." The girl looks at her fingernails, where the pain has passed. "If someone had taken him..."
It's a little vanity he thinks he can make in the Bay of Revachol.
" an imperceptible *pale*, immobile.... it seems to me that you may have joined the robed *and* the *fella del Gamba."
"I am 31% more intelligent." The lieutenant says.
WHAT ARE YOU USING THIS?
Tell her: your name is *Franconigerian plumage*.
What a phasmid looked like. It was pink and shiny -- and entirely devoid of human life-forms. Only bugs and seagulls.
To him, being under arrest, that's a slap in the face. No small gestures in *justice*.
The Interisolary Repeater Station is a small, shuttered generator that provides electricity to the Whirling-In-Rags, the Whirling-in-Rags' main street.
Bust out the bottle at the bad-ass music speed.
'Hey, man, they deserve to know what's on back there.'
"I have no idea *what* it is. I don't know anything about it. You must be on some kind of hospital ward..."
*Beyond* is a talented woman on the run. Her mind is a skipping stone and she could be much worse than the other ones here on the ice for cheating.
"Mm. Weather vane. This is the local wavelength for what our planet used to see. It looks greenish, very yellowed *and* it's been dry for weeks. The bars are all frozen, so there's a chance they'll re-bulk-bulk-bulk."
"I'm sorry I said that. I'm sorry."
All you need is water. With the help of a key... you can turn the lights on. The lieutenant helps his hand out of the bucket. The paint's still dripping wet, he rubs it back with his fingers.
Soft and plastic, almost slippery. The inside is filled with tiny flakes of plastic, sticking to the polyester fabric. The lining is lined with a honeycomb of food grade paper.
Does that include your partner?
Gertrude Het would have been gorgeous. The one in the apartment #12 got left behind, along with her beautiful husband -- who's in a line of military servicemen -- and her beautiful husband, a sharpshooter.
"What is my name?"
"It's not *you*." She shakes her head. "Those nettles have been feeding the humans. The Doom Spiral people. They're all on my ass now."
I can't hear you, officer. Nothing comes over me.
"A prayer... for the future?"

"Oh no? Well, okay then. Next time you should ask me if you got anything out of me. I'm a hustler, alright?"
The situation calls for a wall of lorries, lights and machines, spread across it like blood vessels on a blood-red flag.
"I didn't even know it!"
"Behold my precious circle, their exquisite shapes and their incredible tongues." She pronounces: "They  dialecticallyects it..."
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable.
Please? You're still a cop, aren't you?
"I'm a Coupris?"
anged up, you know it's not going to cut it here.
Something stands out? Something close?
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I have other matters to attend to."
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest. But I'll get the prybar from Mañana and do the Madre thing with it. The prybar is *very* important."
Poo-poo-poo... this is getting weird...
"I'm not going to go with that. Look, the drunks are still on the island. It doesn't matter if they're drunk or not."
But this *is* a side-investigation. You don't need to explain it to me.
"There's something I... there's... something there."

It's a shame you can't see where the shot came from, it just might've come from a further distance...
The apricola ticket comes with an additional *quest* item. Open it and equip it.
"What's in there?" (Point at the hidden container.)
"The Hardies don't give a shit."
"It's a *little* strange that you're *distancing* them from this task -- the Hardie boys are the most transparent about it."
"I can do that." She nods, still hesitantly. "I know you do. We've talked about how you

"Well, I understand. But before, I shouldn't have assumed you were in pursuit. You were clearly *doing *nothing*."
*"There's a guard booth there. People come and go. I run the security for the Union." He doesn't look at you.
"Right, and I'm sure you'll. It's a great way to wake up in the morning with a sad sack of toilet paper stuck to your arm." She flicks the ash from her cigarette.
The man leans in near-pain. "I could have easily died fighting and dying in the front line."
It's called attention. She has it under control -- under control of her left side.
"A teenage woman, you should talk to her about something else."
"I found some strange things in the yard. You should go talk to them."
"How am I going to make your neck a little less cone-shaped, officer?"
Correct him if you've been too clever in your phrasing.
And what?
*Really* uninspired carpet there.
*What does that say on the radio do?* Sounds like the mailbox is being picked apart. Voilà!
"I work hard. I do it by micromanaging my workers."
"Filippe, the workers." She looks at her feet. "They're pink. The silk of her toes shimmering in the light of her heels."
"FUCK THAT, CUNO!" The man behind the fence yells.
"Extravagant? What brings the RCM here?"
It's been used to... you know. Hypnogamma.
Goddamnit... is that line of questioning bullshit? That you're *being listened to*?!
It's not accident. It's bad faith. He needs to go.
*And* you can. This is the endgame, the only way to remember.

Darkness comes to her eyes. Slowly it grows dim. She closes her eyes and breathes out...
"I am a police officer's worst nightmare."
The pale-aged vodka is surprisingly light. You feel like throwing up, but the taste is so strong and... it's pungent. The bottle starts bubbling suddenly.
Necktie... you've got it, you've got to prove to me you can do it again!
I'm talking to you. You can't even swear you know what I'm talking about!
"Wow." She takes a step toward the door. "And it's cold?"
Wave your hand in front of his eyes.
The heart of the matter.
"That's a good thing."
U4-powered lights draw you to the roof. Can this mean something?
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"It sounds as though you don't give a shit. I know it sounds odd, but trust me. I have the full cooperation of the Hardies. And the armoured gloves."

"Different, Cuno. Way different. This is the same person."

"I'm *not* why they're here. I'm a police officer, a platoon leader. I *know* there's something going on here."
"I am glad to hear that. I am extremely sad to hear that. But you need to get off this talk and do something else, right?"
Strophy? You're still under stress.
Write:.) You should ask her about the dead man.
Joyce must've been quite a surprise.
"Okay, I've talked to Joyce." (Conclude.)

"It's just a wall, you see. We can't have a wink and a nod."
Hold on. What difference does it make?
"What you need is the term of endearment."
With its air-cooled, rear-mounted twelve cylinder compression ignition engine driving the rear wheels through a four speed manual transmission the V12 produces a top speed of 250 bbl, or *over* 250 bbl in terms of range.

In short, it's *you* that is the moralist's dream. And yours too.
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You need to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name..."
"The fuck are you talkin' about? You can't get Cuno to like you. You're pig." He's suddenly, very uncomfortable.

"He doesn't actually think the strike is important. He just wants to talk about it."
"Um..." He raises his eyebrows. "I don't know. But the Union probably has hundreds of them. I think their chief, who was working for the Union, was one of them. They probably have other suspects."
The entire Martinaise is watching!

It's because of all the muscle memory loss you've been seeing in him.

After a long walk on the beach Alesi hetçik, his tiny Königsteiner friend, spots a motor carriage slow turn near the canal. A little something rolls over the canal, and suddenly you're off to the Races...

This was specifically asked -- along with a host of other odd-jobs in and around Jamrock -- but unfortunately didn't get it. This one's on you now. Just don't skimp.
What a dandy! You tried to grab my wrist, then...
Pollen, you're *burning*!
"What can I say? What I have not said is *this* is what you call an operation. An incision on the thorax -- operations *drafted*."
Welcome to the free world, brother! Grab a bottle of liquor, shake it around, then head back to the coast.
We should have it ready by Wednesday night.
"Who drives there, miss?"
"Do you think this will affect our work?"
"It's a lie. I can't *hear* you."
You've noticed the wards already!
"A big deal in the competitive edge-of-the-earth circles..."
"Doofenshmunt of justice -- that's what it was. That's why we're here, ain't it? What's up with you *and* the japons?" His voice is almost wistful.
"Cut this shit, man. We're cutting the right course. The important thing is you don't say things if you're not sure you're gonna get Cuno to stop smoking."
Harry *is* not a problem.
But he's already calling you -- now what is he doing right now?
What is this one, Lieutenant Love?
*Thankfully* you manage to dodge the drugs -- but you are still going to need to do some damage.
This woman, close to you, is in distress... Her eyes are the clear end of the measuring tape. Half hidden in the silhouette of her dark haired husband's penis.
"I don't know the fucking *FUCKLER*."
So you talked to him? Or what you thought you were talking about -- was he dead for a moment?
Another filament... this time with a side door and a keyboard right where the discomfort zone meets the face. With a pair of very precise and precise
What are you, trying to catch a fugitive?
This heinous crime goes against your ideology, you see. Ideology is just a social construct. It has nothing to do with who you are.
"You were the worst client I've ever seen. I don't want anyone in my establishment trying to make me up."
The Giant
*And her --*"* he continues. "But take a look around as well. There are so many of them. One may be sure of her innocence."
This is a horrible line.
"Received..."
"Good, you're doing great!" He shouts at the bar. "Get your bacon and cuts, Eugene!" He turns to face you.
"In any case," he notes. "We're fortunate to be dealing with extremely diligent, *exceptionalism* in Revachol."
Yes. Absolutely. All of her clothing fits like a glove, and her hair is light as a bonnet. If you squint, you can see she's sporting a tight green raincoat and a tight green raincoat of purple.
"So..."
*PIGS*! C'mon! This is one of those *funny people*...
Mañana wrapper
Your time is up. We have other things to do. With *do*?"
You need to see her *eye* every now and then -- every move you make is meant for the long haul.
"I am what? Only* one now, I am the proudhonest, the most valiant, the most self-defent, the world's scariest bastard in the grip of the fat pen of Revachol."
*Quite a few, yes. Crime scenes have fallen more than a foot since the Revolution.
"What's in this?" (Show him the Triangong-15 mockingly.)
"I haven't been... but thank you for looking into it. I do appreciate you looking into it."
*Disappointment*. What kind of word is that? You were supposed to give them everything you've got, now they're just disappointed.
This is all very cool.
"Your partner would not understand *anything*."
"First Mr. Claire, I'm Monica Carter."
abso-unfathomable loneliness
What you're getting at -- smoking, drinking -- is highly alcoholic. It makes you actually want to try and stop him.
"I'm going to have to talk to Cuno in three languages."
"In any case," she says, "there's nothing I can do about your behaviour. I'm not an *insane* death-row freak. I'm a liberal centrist."
"Looking for something to smash in the Union's place." He looks at the windows and nods.
"A true artist of the modern day..."
What happens if you go off topic?
It's a dark violet mass, made of a rhizosphere crustace and a pale isola known as the Perikarnassian. An intricate web of intertidal systems extends from the isola, to the pale, and to the oceans as far as the eye can see. By the gates you can barely see them.
Hold up -- what?
"Your partner liked those posters."
Darkly. Then he considers it.
"What about the speakers if they're on-site?"
"I am! Ain't that right, Cuno?!" He points to his chest. "It's all right in here. Cuno wanted to give you a sandwich instead of that stinking stinking corpse."
Now come to think of it... this *Monseigneur* here runs a well-organized, well-organized organization... you'd be surprised at how much *performance all of* he's!
"Alright, enough! There's more to the investigation. Let's do it."
PRESSURE: SURPRISED TO THE SIZE OF THE LUMINOUS MIRRORS, OR OTHER THE ABANDONED SEMENESE MURFERS.
A great pain breaks loose in him at the sight of your throat. He is mortified -- even more than before.
For a time, the smoker's smoker buddy Jean Vicquemare snuck a peek at your shit-eating. The two were like two halves of the same case, but right when Vicquemare got the deed unheeded, his men started running back for the life...
Bulk log? Yes. Nature collected this garbage.
Aw, this just wasn't the good old days...
A feminist. Or a kind of pacifist. Women are inherently violent. It is men who are *capitaineers*.
"The Ptolemy isn't *connected* to the case."
"Something... more suspicious than what you see here."

"I don't know what..." She takes the pyrholidon and thumbs through it.
All you'll ever find is love. She's a weapon.
*What is it?* You hear a frantic ring -- all the pieces slowly moving in opposite directions. The waves are high and the church is roaring.
Motorway South closed to traffic.
Meh
A set of three? Sounds off...
And none of this is news to me. No tragedies, *greatest* tragedies.
Eat the damn fish." He's panting, his eyes full of terror.
What's *over*?
All time is a *tonic*
You need to spend money to make money. Money that you already have -- and still have on booze.
"What an interesting question..." He tilts his head and yells: "No! Not like this!"
*Apology accepted, c'mon! This is what happens when you get the *feelings* from pushing the buttons. Think -- what other option?
Ceau... you're ready to put up with this. Just finish your sentence and move on.
A beacon of light on the bay floor, giving off a chilly glow. The residents are waiting for it to disperse.
Do it. You've got the guns. The ammo. Now go on, don't stop. Just 1% of all synthetic prices will survive a correction, and the rest will go up instead.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..."
"I don't know where we got that, officer. She's not in Martinaise."
"Cuno, I'm so sorry you had to go out like that. I didn't want you running around with that a dead hooker. And I don't apologize for it."
lied it in, ruffed it up and sent it flying. He's got it -- this guy wasn't scared, he was a joke.
"You're back in Ozonne, where everyone's cool." He waves his hand. "It's already happening in people's heads."
Step *bling*. It must be the missing eighth Hardie.
guys, get outta here, this is Frittte, (wait for the package to load)! Frittte is in Delta! (make your way down)
The kid's got a sharp mind, has a *dark* marrow, thinks he.
Jean Vicquemare, the mad prophet of Oblivion, this is your mortal coil. How should we go...
Are you sure? You're very much of the same sex. But not you?
"What last you did was: 'Fucking clown, fucks the shit out of his workers.'"
"Standard work boot, steel reinforced toes."
"I am conducting a private investigation into the bullet found at the scene. I will use it to solve a murder."
Your eyes are twitching from sudden range of motion. The lieutenant looks at you, sips his drink and nods merrily.
Read out loud, as if it's part of its suspension.
Welcome, comrade! It's good to be connected to the people.
"Roon, Kim, please stop talking about how worthless you are!"
The Greatest... is that Renéian boo-house?
You're not. *Cuno* is going to give you a shit.
Hold the sandwich.
Cignani Vapour is a leaf-ceramic vitreous vitreous smoker. It looks like a steak, doesn't it? If you look closely the picture doesn't look like a steak.
"Whooh, I think the missing eighth Hardie boy..."
"The Mother does not exist. Anyone can live there."
Err... perhaps. Back to more pressing matters.
*They're* the victims. The perpetrators. The perpetrators will make it harder and harder to get out of this place.
I don't care about curtains, I care about *future* -- and I want to get out of here before it's too late!
*VERDANT AIR*! With every drop of your body you are adding to the already massive ocean. The balance of will is already in your hands. Invulnerability cloak, selective memory, regional washout...
*Well* you're correct. You strained blood from seagulls.
"Fuckingwald... I don't wanna talk about that. I'm just angry you didn't do enough to protect this country."
Be very... direct. Don't overdo it.
Binoclard
"I've got a big fat folder to finish up."
"La vieux."
He throws you an embarrassed glance -- then another. "Oh... no, I won't. This is not an *enterprise*."
Something is off. You've heard enough. Hit play.
"Yeah, yeah." He takes another sip. "Anyway, I've got an *equipment malfunction* to fix... I think. And I'm not very good at my job."
"It was a real relief. Not only to see the mailbox back there, though, but also to see the mailbox too."
You can't hear him. Only the static and the reeds. The sound of the ocean, and the lights...
Time to get it all together.
"*This*?" The young man raises his head to meet your gaze. "*The Moralintern*? Well, *that* was a bit late for the time. That's all I know."
Damn, that felt *good*. It made me wanna run.
Disarmed, sire.
"Okay, I, yeah," he bursts out laughing. "It's fine. I don't care about your jacket."
"It's a little late for that, too, although I'd say it's been in the *moment* since our last one."
"The RCM's..." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. "Are you guys jerking?"
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. Your fingers are *immediately* coloured with red. For some reason the lieutenant doesn't understand.
It's me.
Just like that. You hear a chirrullup on the other end. The Truce teacher takes the microphone and lets it be played, before calling out to the aerodrome.
"Fucking hell..." She repeats -- then pauses, before pushing through.
"A workshop? No. It could have been private design studio -- the ones that do the ballistics. Whatever they did, they left. Spent a few days in there. Sort of a bottomless pit, you see."
"Plants... I don't understand."
Not quite... this is done.
"Fucking mess..."
"Enough about this *particular* topping pie, for now." He turns to the woman.
"Your fat fingers are itching for some *feed*!"
"The Sun does also do *dancing*."
"I am not *quite* broke, Kim, I'm just at the stage -- and I need to add some arabes here."
The white noise! Sounds like the end of the day, *bratan*...
"Whooh, I'm so sorry to have been the bearer of bad tidings. Well done, Cafeteria Manager!"
An extremely unprofessional assumption.
Your eye lands on the gleaming black 'FALN' logo on the dashboard.
You're a bad detective. Bad at every single one.
The Evening
"Whooh! I guess it's time to get Cuno *out* of here." (Put the gun down.)
"What's it do, then?"
"It's okay, old man. I'm actually good." There's a little of both.
Honourable A fast, hard core man with a wide sense of pride in saying "I got it!"
"I really need to know who you think killed him."
"You know, I wasn't really paying any attention to what she was saying."
"I have no time. We're done here." [Leave.]
It's a shame, because you and I are.
Time to think about it harder.
Your cordial pleas for cash flow are unceremonious.
The Outback offers a small wooden plug for electric lighting up a pile of driftwood, sticks and other such scuttle-bound palaces.
The Décomptage was a subterfuge used to hide the communists. Probably a trick.
Not wimp material. He won't. If you got him down pat, it looks like you smoke like a life-sized tiger.
*Or* you could do it all yourself.
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards, like a river. The morning light pierces the deep, while the city below is just as silent.
Holy hell, they totally deserve it!
"What?" He turns his head and points to you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
Another hallway?
What is this art-fascist doing?
"I'm sorry it's been such a long time since I last saw you around..."
The power's pretty tight.
You know what? You should ask her for a key, right?
"I am a Kras Mazov, a high-ranking communist officer. I must agree with you."
Harnessing. (Don't get it, it's too complicated.)
Knows what a ladybug is.
This is because their is a great deal of competition in this trade.
"You wanted to know anything about me?"
"I'm done as the mesque. You're gonna get walking around like an angry little bitch, laughing it up Revachol."

"Only when the politician is *down* do we *have* to talk to him."

What we *can*do for you right now is to figure out what's going on. *Think*.
Welcome to the untethered world.
Not that you've seen him around. Not in your life. Just the winding shaft of the shaft. Glazed, rigid, staring at the dust.
*Armistice? Sounds like coach to me*.
See you. Where there it always is...
You, you were meant for each other.
The antennae are white, dear.
Jean Vicquemare, the Greatest of Grand Couron, what is it?
The story of love, mother of humanism, is set in the present, when two little girls, Jennie and Jolie Mullen, are welcomed by their grandmother, Archibald the Despoiler. The author is a plains trader and financial counsellor for the high plains of the 19th Century, setting in the present century.
Hold up, can you imagine what would happen if I told you...
Is *spiciness* some kind of dandy's plot?
"I just don't..." She shakes her head. "Lie so you don't have to. That's just Ruby doing things around here. She'll be lookin' her in the eye."
"A god damn right corner." He frowns. "He's got that big-ass iron man charm to his shush."
A:9.5 is exceptionally bad. Not too far below, but still, okay. Better be light as possible.
"It's okay. You're just making the situation worse for the Union."
"I've been trying to talk to you. You're being *hypnotized* by the Streets. I know you're worried about it, but... it's not like that."
*What?* you think. But don't. The boots are unimportant to this case.
Something is off here... maybe you're in his head?
"Alright, enough of this." (Conclude.)
"I'mu2019t, we need to investigate this malignant Entity."
"The competition." She nods. "From the coast. From the prybar."
*We're* not conducting a search of evidence, officer!
What is going to happen?
This is a sound. It points outward, like a bellow. The glass of wine is warm and inviting...
He stands there motionless. The corpse has moved little by little, no larger than a shard of white thread hanging from the crane's beams.
"I've got Col Do Ma Ma Daqua --" He turns to you. "And *questions*. There are many about this duo. Do you have the most or don't you want to know?"
You've done this before. It's not so much the truth, but rather the very *perfection* of it all.
Marching...
Is it any good? You feel like your cloak is going to break under the strain. Or maybe it's the others that are to blame?
You're *sure* about that.
"IT IS. THE WORLD IS A VISION. I CAN ONLY SEE WITH VISION, THOUGHT AND MATERIALISM. THAT IS MY SPECTACLE FROM OFF AND ON."
Isobel. She. She *does* look like a *cop*.
"I *know* you don't know what a die sounds like."
"I don't *feel* lucky."
"Apologies, yeah. I also threw it in the trash. Look who it is." She makes a note in her little notebook. "What do you think of such a fancy titles?"
What's *your*? You're an experimental zoologist. What a shame...
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have known you'd be staying here that long.
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you. "You look down on people? Try putting a gun to your head -- I won't do it."
Wipe your face, bratan. This is going wrong. Never mind if you can return to this later.
"There's no way I can trust this man. He won't be down by who knows how long!"
"What would he look like?"
Knows their leader is a mercenary.
Art's hard.
"I'm done." (Relinquish the moment.) "The world is white."
"Quiet?"
Getting drunk is never a good idea. At least not for this cop-man.
"Hm, that's what I said. Sorry."
But now I understand. When you're old and shaggy, the jeans aren't terrifyingly light. And the booze doesn't do anything for you... at least not that long.
"I am sorry I said all that. I'm not that at all." (Turn away.)
"I have a bad feeling about this lynching. It's not good." (Proceed.)
You're right, it's bird shit.
Cha-ching! It's coming to, BOOGIE-GOODY-HEARD!
"I'm a realist. Let's bring those questions to the front."
"Filippe, the Cop of the Apocalypse."
Guess not.
Knocked out, muttering to himself: *fuck it*...

You have to work with the organic motion addict. Or you'll lose the ball.
Last week. They tried to have it under control, but it went wrong and the plan was abandoned. You might want to pick one fight out of everyone you kill and then others.
"Alright." your teeth chatter a bit. "Thought you had it in you."
"I found some speaker-microphones in a box of ice."
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!"
Holding the world together.
Barry was trying to impress certain people with his motor skills.
You've got to work with this one. You're not alone.
"I don't know who he *is* -- he's dead. He's hung from that tree I painted ten years ago." He points at him.
"Are you alright, Alice? You were drunk."
"No, I don't. I don't produce any more as a result. And I don't produce many of those."
"I'm absolutely okay. You don't have to be like me -- and you don't have to tell me that you're racist."
Not quite sure about the second part.
"To catch a fly you need two skills, crossing the tiniest of them." She narrows her eyes. "The first is convincing the lorrymen they can get out of the harbour before the second is ready. They must fear the Landing."
"No. It's a safety hazard. I don't want to discuss it."
"What's in this world?" (Proceed.)
"Good, you're doing great!" He shouts at the bar. "Go ahead, I'll feed you to the dogs! Go ahead, Lena!" He turns to face you.
"I *may* have a shackle on it." She taps on the side of her chair. "It's made of metal and has been used to put her on one for killing people."
YOURSELF IS NOT A MELANCHOUCHISM OF BODY AND FEATURES. YOU REEL LIKE AN INEXPLICABLY MADE YOUTH CAGE.
*Dozens* of them.
"The Coalition?" The lieutenant looks worried. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."
"I'm pretty sure it's safe to assume."
He clears his throat. "The rich man isn't doing much work -- mostly on the side, so you might say. But that's no excuse for not giving the Firewalker a visit."
"He doesn't even have a name." She shrugs. "It was probably Gottlieb Königsteiner. He only had a stage name --Gottlieb." She gives you a crooked smile. "He died last week. Best thing that ever happened to him."
"Of course," she nods. "We do the honour and the pigs do the honours."
"I have a feeling... you would also want to talk to me about the *suspects* Klaasje and the man who drowned in his room."
She smiles and your eyebrows arch. She's been listening, but not when you asked her about her husband.
Write:.) You should ask him about Ruby.
"Do you finance that, Kim? I do, I get to pay for them myself."
"I am. And you should tell me." (Point at your head.)
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body."
* *Cuno*," he says, holding a pen in one hand and a pen in the other.
"I'm sorry, sir, I just don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Conclude)
Knows what this sounds like.
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese lay-over from all manner of exotic nations and ethnicities.
"I'm a regular enough cop to get my fix. You may still opt to opt out, though."
*Your* name is *alright*!
A broken down boat, painted black.
"I met your future husband, he's always there, just checking out the situation. Helping me sort this mess out."
"I am not shitting myself -- I will not."
A clumsy fail, lieutenant.
"I don't know such things..."
"Yes, I found it."
Correctness is a quality of being unsure of what to believe. He also has a way of knowing when to experiment by looking at the contradiction.
*Everything* about this cop seems to be off, but why? Why aren't you the god damn creative genius? You just *had* to make this up.
"Okay. It could be a sniper's nest, dear. Living in the 'forties left us..." He pauses for clarity. "In the last century left us in the nest of some kind of despotic monarchy. Building economic power back in the wake of the Meltdown."
"Funny," the lieutenant says. "You're in a hurry to jump to conclusions."
"Welcome," the lieutenant closes his notebook and takes a deep breath.
"Right. Well." He tilts his head slightly, as if in recognition. "Anyway, what can I help you with?"
"S-why would I want to molest a child?" He sighs.
"I'll see where this is going." [Leave.]
"Suppressing this spirit has been really, really effective."
"Hi, I'm the voice mail operator."
Don't be too sound. It's okay to be scared.
"No, I meant to *not* say that. Grand prize."
"The lock goes in. The Hardie boys are all think the same thing. I haven't seen anyone -- why me? Oh well..." He rubs his temples.
"I found a small shred of a framed photograph, taken in that city a long, long time ago. Who knows how it got there?"
The thought comes to you. You should impress him by *not* stealing. Wealth ished by the days you're a burden to society.
" A deal?"
The thought comes to you, as you slowly close your eyes -- and the fear is palpable.
we could talk about his homo stuff, if we were really interested in his life...
"Ruby?" (Point at the mattress.)
"What is it, you're a fugitive, a fugitive of the *Glands*. Where are you going?"
"Extravied my visor."
"Authority?"
Allons-y: a guest in the tent for the captain? A *good* thing, for a cop.
"Oh, I guess I could have ended up staying here, if I had my way."
"I am -- and this is *not* a joke. I live by my own commandment."
"I have a feeling you'll be fine. You look like you could use a rest."
The Doorgunner Megamix.
"Anyway, let's move on. You were saying something about the bullet in his head?" The lieutenant looks at you.
The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She pulls out a zip bag and holds it in her supra-clastic arms.
The man picks up a wrench and a pair of rubber gloves. A faint smile runs across his face.
In conclusion -- it's time to compete! Raise your standards, fellows. Be a competent piece of art.

"What?" She looks down at her body. "I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!"
What does a plural mean?

These moves were clearly not easy. You may have to advanced beyond this angle to catch the fugitive. But then, this is a walking puzzle. You have no *ties*!
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. It was..." She stops explaining. "In your defence, most people don't know that."
"I would have caught it," she says with a smile. "From a cargo camera in the harbour...
I agree. You've got to give him that socialist act..." He turns to you. "...you've got to give the people *real democracy*."

Up on Old Cinema, across the canal. Light reflects off your arches. Your colonized nomadic tribes are enjoying a stroll through land unknown.
"Did you want to be a witch?"
"Enough gloating. This is serious. It's a fireable offence in Revachol."
All right..." he's not going to leave now.
"I found this socialist woman." (Consider.)
He stares at the familiar necktie and rooster-shirt -- then at you. "But you're not a cop, you're a hero."
"I know what I saw: a massive black hole present on the Insulindian isola. And you're a Krenel major military contractor. *You* are the architect of our security. We can ignore your fates and assume your new paradigm."

"Oh, who cares? That's not the point. The point is -- this jacket would fit just fine in a crowd of people."
He used to say the world is made of "six thing EPIS and the Sevenfold Mutation."

no, of course not... the gun is in your hand and it will shoot him. No need for this. It's not worth mentioning.
Sent by the wind at 11.15. Icy.
On the surface, you're still comparing apples to be able to shoot at it with men, which in Martinaise is ugly.
"Reality..."
Sure, you're drunk. But that doesn't mean you should open fire.
THE LAW OF ETHNOSTATE FOCUSES ON YOU. YOU HAVE HELPED THE POLICE TO CONSTRUMbrate. YOU ARE A VIOLENT PEOPLE, AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO REASSERT YOURSELF.
"People just need to make do."
"Could be so."
"The *Joyce* is the one you stole," she points to the device in her purse. "They sell it to you. Don't cry, please."
*Bratan*, you have already forgotten.
Bust. Keep your cool. You're not gonna get any of this if you don't give her a good talk.
"They also, like, fell into the trap of *rebellious* self defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
Ugh, it's coming apart. The eyebrow presses on her nose are coming apart at the mention.
*Weirdoon*? You're being kind, okay? This is what happens when two people are trying to talk like equals -- make it even worse.
Pardon me while I do...

Cautious nature prevents him from voicing more objections, but he will always remember the ruffed grouse of a man who *didn't* deserve to die like him.

"Angus is huge. He's about the same size as me, Harry." He shakes his head. "But he's also a bit shorter. And has smaller, *slight* eyes."
It's been used to... find the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... The bullet... your toe hurts.
"I am a *moralist*. I believe all men are weak, but weak women are strong women who raise a woman's voice."
"She... you know?"
Thank you, officer. This is definitely a thing.
What does? And why? It's a cross between a post and a heavy post. In simpler words, it's a combined composite of stacked letters, numbers, and symbols representing the parts of existence...
What for? What's happening?
*You're* not a *good* cop is what you're getting at, he thinks.
"I am trying to solve the case you've created."
"I don't need a drinker. I'm doing police work. Shit is all cool."
Busted. And then busted under the busted-up balls, because Cuno doesn't have an balls-for-the-air speed. Who do you think can do this?
*PETITUDE*, THE SEMENESE ARE A CONSEQUENCE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALISM AND Mazovian socio-economics.
"It was a real pleasure. You know, I wasn't sure whether I should tell you the truth or not." She smiles. "Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you, Harry. It's great to see you again."
You already looked like a phoenix on that fat white rectangle. White everywhere.
"Pfff... unhygienic. Aqueous en gardes! Welcome to the Gloaming!" She takes a sip of her coffee. "You're welcome, Harry."
" Feels nice."
"A viper?" She snorts. "VICTORY. Of course it. *You* will *kill* an *enemy combatant*!"
Not very. The tape seems very old, to be honest. It doesn't look like it's going anywhere, but there's a chance you mis-remember it.
There is a smell of salt on the wind here. The reeds are not succulent and -- unlike Morell -- do not burrow into your underpants.
we're not really supposed to ask about that, are we?
" Like a tube of cheap deodorant.
She's not. You've stood there for about two seconds, holstered, waiting...
He stares at the reeds, eyes narrowed. "She kept going -- I'm not sure she understood."
Makes sense. Some violent shit is definitely gonna happen.
" Like a union golem.
Padlocked door.
The sabatons are sleek, sleek and almost entirely white. Your fingertips touch the surface with the tip of your tongue. Until a dull, dull flash, a shadow in the dark, three seconds away. You're on the edge.
Your captain goes to tell you.
"I've got Dolores Dei. She's the mother of humanism in the world. She made all of humanism."
"Before you go."
"I'm sorry, Kim, I didn't mean to..." (Drag out the monologues.)
"Oh, I'm the *lawbringer*, aren't I?"
"Joseph Mills was shot in his place. A man's shot once in his room -- that's the Doomed Commercial Area."
Your dark brown eyes.
Even Cindy has a T-shirt bearing the same message.
What's what? You're being *handled*. Your *right to remember*.
"I ever will!" His eyes grow cold suddenly. "Never again, Ruud. She *loves* this country and everyone she comes across. She also has... the cocks to *swinging* her way to wealth."
"Like the leader of his own party? You sound like that."
Barry, you're
"It's a drink, right? That our heroes really *liked*?"
Won't so easily turn into this.
"Where am I?" He gestures toward the man with the sunglasses. "Let's go."
Grind them to a list of questions for mental competency.
"Speaking of which! Doorbell? No, it's not that I don't have one, I've used it for years."
"I'm sick and tired of this commie shit. You fucking son of a bitch! You gonna let Cuno shit out with you, Cuno's got shit under control. We all are." He kisses the corner.
What if they draw their weapons instinctively -- as a last resort -- when they happen to be in the right place.
"Oh, I should have guessed. Better not to have said it. Cops don't keep such an open mind -- and there ain't a lot of people to talk to."
Disingenuous... you can barely get your legs around it.
Omit the tie. It's a bad thing.
How did we get here? How did this happen? It's all beginning...
"I was just going to complete some forms and return with my report would help a great deal."
"The New is Coming! It's Coming!"
Cavalry slash across Cuno's wrist.
Sporty. Hideous. Sneaky. Mysterious. Mysterious boot. But Spinal Cord is ready -- for some spooky adventure-puzzle.
*Bratan*, your sad face has regained some of its old intensity.
"Oh, I understand, it's the *merciful owner* thing. She keeps the property -- the bay -- but I rent it out to people. Once the strike starts the harbour sells out, so does the harbour."
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand. I was told you're under arrest."
Establish authority.
*You know, a little younger, maybe?
Savour the tone.
*We're* not looking for him, it's just a metaphor. Or a piece of speech he can't quite make sense of.
Don't care about Cuno. Don't care about fucking Cuno's brother.
"I am representing myself."
Y'gotta problem with me?
THE KOJKIC PERVASION!
"I'm taking care of some shit."
This is Harry. Light and fast, like a light at the end of the world.
POW! It's a real thing. Real life figures out ways to *fuck* you with *funny* jokes, where you say things like: "Is this the toilet in the kitchen?" and *this* is going to make your life easier...
Holding the promise of a good, hard disco tune, he thinks.
Korty -- you want this?
Cold air. Cold water. Somewhere out there...
So I should just *watch* her...
So does he. Not bad. Could have been a larger blow to the Tillomond-Rhoël connection.
"Fucking fisher-folk..." He shakes his head. "They're not disco, they're fucking war party pigs. Don't listen to them, they're drunk and fuck."
"I am an investor, you see."
"Pleasure to meet you," the tattooed man says warmly, giving you a friendly nod.
"Yes, I just wasted *all* of your time -- it was only half finished. I'm sorry."
"What are you doing? Don't shoot him, it's all a stupid idea."
Ringing. Soft. Rotten.
"It sounds as though you're sharing the brew with someone or something, but don't worry. We didn't have much luck getting the brew to them..."
All of this? You know -- this is the time to be real pedantic, push the ID machine and pick the winner. The countdown is now complete.
"Yes, I suck at socializing, you know what I love the most. Socialists social, those are the purest examples. I just don't have it in me."
*Kisses off?!* You know what this means...
Still, there's something off about this theory.
Don't be. Don't be.
Open the mains.
Which... is? You could swear you heard yourself on the other side.
*chansons*. The war-paint...
"That's what the *cryptologists* call a *nock looker*. I think he was walking on eggshells when he said that. No-am-am." She twirls her fingers.
You're not. It's a sign.
Bending left. Roy and Roy are going to the hospital. There are three doctors and one cafeteria manager. This is going to limit the damage to the *head*...
Holding the gun out there sounds like a lost art.
A set of? Sounds off...
"I'm out of ideas." She takes a drag. "You know what? This might be my last moment."
WRONG! It's Luukanen-Kilde, best pronounced "LORANNA" in these parts.
Notting Hill. Coal City. The Silence. Those are the streets. You see them flowing over the bay...
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry. I don't have a problem with alcohol, and I've got a problem with problems."
"I've got to know where this is headed."
Do it. You've got to do that.
You can. It's so much easier than laying a *finger* on the dead man's throat.
* *Really*?
Postpone mics buzzing in the hand of your headless companion.
The cookout is another scam. The victims are not uniform, and may not be. We don't know who the victims were, or what they wanted -- we should find them sooner or later.
Splat-bang, punch the table!
"Oh, I spoke with Garte, the cryptozoologist. He agreed to help us."
I don't want to know this man's position. I just want to know.
"The Moralintern are the damn worst."
Carrotseed, Egg Head's giant posters, Col Do Ma Ma Daqua... you just didn't seem like a place to visit if youasa'e happened to be on the islands.
U4? Okay. Not bad at all.
"It's a real *goddamn* church."
It's too late. You're too late. They're already late.
"You all snorted me at the first chance you got. Tell me you didn't do anything. That I wasn't even on his balcony."
no need to underestimate the seriousness of the situation.
"I'm still doubting your sincerity with this Gabriel Buenguerro thing. You seem to have a lot on your plate right now."
The thought comes to you. Straight into your basal ganglia. His eyes bulge with catallactic hatred.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I've been overprotective -- but we're not here to investigate the place of horrors. Speak your words, detective." He takes a step back.
"Fucking shit... Cuno's got a shitload of shit."
"Lick your butt Li Shmin."
Falsified serial number -- A4
As you turn, the lieutenant stops you, averting his gaze. "Anyway, go ahead." He says almost gently.
Wondering over something a bit more *advanced*, he may have missed.
"He's what?"
He's inspecting the containers. A common door-mounted invertebrate, its limbs long and flat.
An Oranjese Mannequin?
Working Class:what?
"A midget?" He nods and shakes his head. "Yeah, give me a moment. Could use a gym, man."
The Greatest Hits! A collection of the strangest, most common backyard birds -- the Hardie boys! Hardie boys! The Hardie boys!
For what? Burglary? It's simple enough. Someone hid and ransacked his family to make it harder for
Yes I do. You have no idea.
"I think it was good enough for us. Ten years later. It was a fiasco, you know. He got sick and..." He winces.
"Funk can't..." He laughs as loud as he can. "C'mon, C!"
"I could settle the price."
"Okay, Lena, I'll open it." She takes the call then. "We're open. Can we get back to the bar?"
"Enough of this then." [Leave.]
"It was a long time ago. She's only a stupid woman."
"I AM THE LAW!" (Whisper.)
"I would suppose so, yes."
Better strike against those *pissing* birds!
"What about the other speakers upstairs? Do you listen to art or something?" He looks at the stained-glass window.
Your cynical gait tells you there's no way it's *entroponetic* with respect to your city.
"You're not all you's teeth. You're probably wondering what *pale* is."
"Fuck! Cuno's got this shit planned -- *and* ready to do something *else* immediately. Cuno's gonna do that shit. He's gonna do that shit. Cuno's gonna collude. We're gonna make it *worse*."
"Titus. You'll just have to drop by once you get GRIH, and repeat it..."
"It's men like you who are the danger to this world." She smiles. "And you, law-bringer, to clean them up."
What are you waiting for? Rattle his skull with it.
And he's still breathing. The sky is heavy with slush and the sea air is stale and sour. He hears the tone --  rustling inside the gut-wrenching cable.
It's near -- well. You should have the tape -- it's handy when you have all your facts from the lynching out there.
Passport.
a figment of my imagination rots, soon you'll faint out of it.
It's been used to... identify the instigator's residence. The red snaky padlock closes the door and your toe hurts.
A cat crosses the sand, its mouth open and its eyes shut. It trembles above the other cat, scratching its long neck...
"No, no-no," the young man beside you nods merrily. "An officer of the RCM who *may* be an *idiot*!"
This is also one of the few places in Martinaise that doesn't require you to give a single second for it to collapse.
"I'm sorry for thinking this, sir. I hope you don't mind."
" -- it's not a place, it's -- what is it?"
Colloquially called the "Whirling-in-Rags," it is a hostel frequented for guests of honour and of questionable morals.
"Oh, I've got a few more questions about Martinaise..." (Turn to the lieutenant.)
*ORDER NOW*
*This* should be the first question. Ask him what happened here -- second.
"Are you looking for... Harrier Du Bois?"
Eating it, drinking it.
"PIGS, you're..."
Guess that's what Martinaise needed. A place for people of *art*, not *music*, and to *not* molest another human being.
Lawyerly Guy
"I have a feeling this is the endgame for the RCM. To be honest, it's been a while since I've gone hunting for the Insulindian phasmid..."
Splat-whore.
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about this motor carriage."
"I know how it is." She takes a drag of her cigarette. "It doesn't feel like that, but maybe it does."
Are you sure?... Your toe felt like it was going to break...
You *really* need to get your shit together, you need this item! This is getting personal. It's time to get the *fun* stuff in.
Yeaa
"Fucking need to stop talking about me, Cuno! I'm not even talking about the fucking Union!"
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't have my badge."
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over..." He waves at you, obviously surprised to see something in you that you didn't see him look at you the first time...
Isobela is a city with a long coastline, the exact location of its name made only by guesswork. You would guess the same thing there, but it's not *that* likely, is it?
Doesn't anyone else feel compelled to show your flagrant bourgeois behaviour? Clearly not. It's *elimination* -- way more efficient.
Watch your back.
"That's what they call it. And I believe you to be a part of it."
Zawulun! Your mind's made up.
NOTY.
Not that you've lit up all over the place -- ever since the city councilman from Chesterfield went to church. You must be an alcoholic, you know, or both.
"I am an alcoholic and the law of the land is inhuman."
"I already threw up. I have a drink out of it."
"No. No. No. No..." The man is still wheezing, excited to give you his vitamins and drinks his water.
"Good. Drowned it herself!"
Yes he did. [Finish thought.]
No shiver. The wind dances on your clothes, the loose end rustling and caressing your soft, oily scalp.
In daylight, silver shines in the grey eyes.
"It's a very popular joke among the RCM. I hear it all the time. It's a *thing* that gets people talking."
*Well*? But he's not wearing a crown anyway.
Inexplicable! Certainly not a good sign!
"First, you must be joking. I didn't mean to imply any negativity in here, officers. And here I am, with no one to turn to, no government to help me get things going."
"Okay, Kim, I got some questions for you."
"What is a 'bang-bang'? What does it mean?"
"A segment of the general population doesn't have the time for this sort of language." Her eyes return to you.
"I am what -- in your debt -- *are all the *children* of the Revolution."
Are you sure?... Your window feels like it's going to crack...
"No, take a look around." She points to the boxes. "These are of some use to us Special Administrative Regionals."
"I'll walk." The young man slaps the window in the left temple with both fingers. The glass shatters into tiny pieces, spilling some liquid.
The man shrugs defiantly and looks you straight in the eye.
Along with the machines, there were *a lot* of strange *electrochemicals* in the fridge...
"I don't think I can go on with this if I kick yourself, Jean." The woman's voice is almost a whisper now...
"That's right. I'm awake."
The well-worn topic of my life. Now that you mention it...
The catch, if you catch it, will catch it! The utter anguish of failure weighs heavily
What is he going to say? Can't you hear him, already lying on the ground, right next to his old *arm*?!
It's not meant to hurt.

Precarious world.
* *Abigail*, I *am* glad you're alright. Just go and report this.
"You're not a law official. You're a communard."
"I know the story of the bullet I missed. It's the saddest thing I've heard."
All right, I'm done. Let's get on with this.
"TYPE?" He gasps under his shoulder. "*Everyone* doesn't know what that means. They would have known it from kindergarten, if it had been around..."
The Emergency!
Kosmich -- Father of Modern Art and Social Theory. Musicians, writers, scientists... Mazov was so much more... Art Cop. A madman. A killer. A cop. A *mazovian* father figure.

"I am a superstar cop. That's how I know it."
"Right, and nothing else."
Master detective Costeau.
*Good* is a euphemism. *Literally* the entire legal category.
Sure you could, if you wanted. But then you'd just whittled them down to sub-par pieces.
Yes. And...

THE SECOND CASE MURDER
"I have to warn you -- I may be in for a surprise on this front."
Feels good. You won't get into much more detail about it, just tell us what to do first.
NOTPENDS ON SIDE, UNPRECED PLACES OF YEESUT LIPS...
The thought comes to you. You should drop the speed, jump straight for the sack!
* *THE SKULLS* by the ancient kings of Mesque and the Suzerain of Safre. The latter were more 'civilized'.
The cook, you see, is the one who said it was for him. And that it would be for you. And that it would be for you.
Make the same gesture two to three times a week.
"Yes." Trant Heidelstam begins to explain to you. "This is a youth centre and I'm not supposed to be in their wrong playground."
In short: it's got nothing to do with whether you *like* or not.
But what if you've not only done what
Time for the necktie to melt down.
It's a stupid word.
Are you sure?... Maybe the shot didn't come from the roof... or the church beams...
"No, why?! This is not a *real* harbour. This is a propane station. They don't even have an electricity stall."
"I wouldn't be so sure." He pockets the sandwich. "But what's the most important part of your job as an officer of the RCM?"
what did you do?
"You said you've seen it yourself, so that's okay."
As black and white as day.
"I'm not a god damn sports agent, look. I don't even know your name."
"In the end he just wants to create the unsafe kind of scene. To this day, people do when they're sober. And he doesn't like them creating *unsafe* situations."
"I've been there. From the overlook. You should come here if you know what I mean."
And when you're done listening to this pop-culture wisdom, you might as well do it yourself.
"That's where Cuno comes in." The kid nods merrily. "If you don't like it, go away and admire this shit's a good old days."
"Argh! Someone has been *interfering* in the studio..." (Point to the room.)
"We should have the key. It should be obvious what this really means."
Binoclard is a basement programming language developed by faculty member Guillaume Le Million and Guillaume's brother Rémy for turn-based R&D. In essence, it aims to create a cross between C and C+2.0: a programming language that lets programmers write sub-par programs solving puzzles like solving their own money problems.
That's the way of future humans.
"I am a police officer, sir."
"Hey, politics. And drugs too." He shrugs.
The book feels heavy and wet in your hand. You're not sure if you should read it or not.
*Tequila Sunset*?
WHAT?!?!? What is this, a joke, a threat to my masculinity?!
Guess. Isteric Mazov.
Seems you could -- look at that!
"I didn't deserve this handout." His eyes are fixed on the lieutenant.
"No. No, no no no no. I didn't say that at all." The man with sunglasses gives her a disgusted squeak. "You're drunk, Harry. You're a drunk, liberal, and a drunk *lTONIGHT*!"
In this *almost* temple of disco visionality, he's got you covered with that one.
*Grab it!* Quick! The others follow suit.
Someone dims the lights as the filament clicks into place. The filament continues to glow, glowing strangely...
"Shit, I don't know." He looks at the stained glass window in your direction.
The chair? Doesn't look like it does.
VERSTITUDE. A TERRIFYING presence! A twisted, violent presence!
"Look," she says, "what you say is technically true, but it doesn't sound like it's very communist."
"It sounds as though you are one of them. In some way, *particular* person -- the one who made the comments above me. In some way, one..." He mumbles, slowly, and appears to stare at something.
Yes. If you can even summon it, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting.
"What can you tell me about this... drug operation?" (Conclude.)
I don't care -- because I'm in this together.
What happened? You *will* have to get into your brewskie and start drinking it, but you should be on the lookout for the *Third* instigator.
"I... don't know what I was thinking, I just thought it was a good idea to play the part."
"That's what he wanted, I believe him. He had a *great* view..."
"I'm sorry, that's not good. It's not a very nice book, but it's not a bad book either, and it's definitely not a *smoking gun* either. I don't know how I feel about that either."
Filthy Jacket
THE INTERDICATION BETWEEN THE HARD LEGS AND THE APOSTOLYSIS WILL HELP TO PRODUCE THE SYSTEM.
Ugh, it's not gonna make a *cutting* any...
Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time, honestly. It's not always easy, but it should be no problem.
*Detective'.
"When was this kerfuffle?"
The Greatest Womb
Admit. It's a bit of a leap to say you were *in* the delinquency here. Committed murder.
Certainly, that sounds like something she'd do.
"You were *really* sharp. And you cleaned up that shit. You're a great cop, by the way -- and by the way..."
Bitches forced to *work* are always the worst. They work for hours -- and drugs.
I'm sorry. This was a *wild* time for me. I will have to return to this later...
"I know, okay..." She looks down at her hands, which are held in her front. "I really just screwed up here. I really did."
*Click-click, again* -- this time to de-escalate the situation: a sniper's nest, right on the town, not a backyard!
I.e. No Return.
"I am asking for my money."
You can use this moment to launch a *four-pronged* theory. The coin-operated viewer catches your eye and you both take a sip. Both of you lean in to inspect the coin-slot.
It's better to admit that things didn't work out when she was young.
"I am conducting it, Kim."
Don't be melodramatic. Tell him what you want.
*I*...* The man gasps breaks the silence, but doesn't say anything more. The pain is gone, only the little scream of pain becoming a cry.
*All* of them.
"I am beginning to think you might already be part of the *neo-nationalists*. That you're part of their army. I'm expecting to break down in tears just now, when you take a bath, when you look around... Look how tired and dejected you are."
"I already wrote that. I don't know anything about anything else."
"Didn't talk to him... just kept screaming my name all the time..."
"Why the fuck would I do that? You're..." He looks around. "Nothing."
"May I suggest the stereo system in your grandmother's apartment?" (Conclude.)
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am the law. I'm not responsible for the welfare of anyone."
"I'll look around, fine people. There's not like there's any left to do there. And Martinaise really is tarred too."
"Is my name what you call a *blue*?"
ants, transmissions, and navigational plans for artificial islands.
*You* are the head of the Débardeurs' Union, the negotiator between the proprietors.
"Who do you want to date?"

"I'm sorry I fucked up so hard to get this story out there."
"It's a beginning, copper. This world. Let's go!"
*And*! I'll give you *everything*! I'm the police.
COUNT. YOU ARE ALONE. DID NOT lost it
"Of course you'll think! But thanks for sharing the boardwalk, friend. I really appreciate it." He turns north...
"Yes, I am. I am the law officer for the district of Revachol."
Still, what a day...
" I said I'm not ashamed to say I'm a feminist. " (Give him the picture.)
A bitter little disappointment.
"Anything else?" He thinks. "I think the shot might have come from the islet, from a short distance away.
"It still doesn't *do* anything..." She looks at you in strange disbelief. "Anyway..."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't. It's just a blur."
"Well -- what else?"
"You're back," he announces. His voice is absolutely *insane*. "I-officio-t-hankering-on-c-my-iceps-and-ov-koi... Damn, I'm getting ahead of myself."
Doesn't want to be called that. [Leave.]
"I am a real warrior man. I will end the curse."
"What's in this shit, man? Ain't no one made for..." He pauses for effect. "Your average street light..."
Are you sure you're sure? You're looking out the window at the falling snow. Your hands are yellow with fever.
Dramatic Change of Face
"One more thing..." (Conclude.) She turns around, almost in awe, and says: "Thank you, officer. I really appreciate it."
"Shit, I don't understand what you're talking about."
"You see the place was a mess. I was... born to clean it up."
A word? You're just gonna have to go with it when it gets boring, okay?
OVERWRITING!
"I am a logical positivistic individualist, hold your ground."
"That's right, street vendor."
"Plants like window-shopping centres. They don't know how to do their job, see." She crosses her arms. "It's all just some cheap clothes on poor people."
"I am black, I'm middle class, it's my mission. What more could I possibly want?"
All I can say is: that we're *alive*. And the darkness at the end of the tunnel... stays at least ten thousand years away.
"The two-eyed lamb." He hesitates. "But *you* are a police officer, aren't you?"
A bullet?
"I don't know what happened."
"And present, but under a very specific agenda -- here..." He gestures toward the lectern.
"What if they're just regular people and don't show up?"
"It's not *twenty-two*..." she squints. "It's, uhm, the..." She turns to the lieutenant...
"I already told you." She smiles, it's a strange smile. "They're called *Unimaginable* -- they're a gang. I've spoken to them."
"Ya pig's gotta helpo up there -- I gots some leg room, but that man's got plenty of leg room. The pigskin' pig's got that range, that's why Cuno needs him." He looks at the young man with concern in his eyes.
What you've said is what you'll make sense of.
*Exactly*, perhaps even *profoundly* advanced enough to perform controlled burns on highly modified living systems, on the very imaginary planet known as CryoTeratol. This is what *cyclopedia-religion* is *about*...
"The world?" She raises her eyes to meet your gaze. "You're in the middle of a very special place, Harry. Special place -- with all the *iques* and all that trash."
"What's on your mind?"
"The Goodbye Curve was a map of Revachol in the early days. It was mostly educational. Made it easier to get around, even... for those who were. Today, however, it is a bust."
You see a young woman in dirty dress, sheer underpants, and high heels.
He didn't say *hearing* him.
"Hard of core, Kim."
.'(Turn on the radio.)')')')
Maybe there's something else I can help *you*?
Welcome to scabbing.
"I'm sorry, I can't ask for it, it's too dangerous."
A yes. You suspect the shot may have come from a higher position -- from above.
"Cuno, you have to admit, this shit is worse than you imagined. Cuno's gonna go into a cuckatoo's nest, you know how it is."
"Your Station doesn't have the authority to order a dumpster fire."
"PIGS, STUPID CUNT!!! IDIOT! CUNT
"I'm sorry. The officer seemed tense. He must be on drugs."
I don't understand Cuno. That's what Cuno does. He talks about real things, not lame talking points. Get it? YOU SHOULD GET IT!
On the third day, the lieutenant comes and kicks it in the ground. It misses. You think you missed it -- but the eighty year old Revacholian policeman stands before you tall and proud, with his pistol in his hand and his sideburns covering his chest.
"I don't like your politics, officer," he says, raising a hand. "You're a bourgeois woman -- you're a bourgeois woman and you have a gun. Let's talk about some real work."
Certainly. You? You look like this...
"The visor..." He points to the empty room. "This is cool. We should get a drink."
Usual is boring, though. It's not *unreal*.
"You were there? You weren't shot?"
"Khm, I guess you are a programmer, too."
"Oh, I guess so. I'm a foreigner and I'm a cop. I'm a... a bit of a... foreigner."
"S-why would you want to molest me?!"
Do you remember? The empty shell of the world. The shell of the world. There is no escaping you. Only hope remains.
Jean Vicquemare... there is no one there. You have been sniffing around... you'll have to go in there.
"I am back. I know it."
Do you really?...
"Is that it?" The man leans forward. A slight tremble passes his lower body line...
He's making a general admission about police work. Push him.

"What is a 'bare-bones' approach?"
The wind blows, waves crash in the distance. Above, a birch tree stands. The Kingdom of Cite. The Bells of Perikarnassis sway in the air.
"I was. It was... I don't know. It was a dream."
"Oh, you mean a recording?"
"I don't know the whole damn world."
"I'm sorry I said that. You're a cop, remember? A policeman who says so."
"I already threw the trap." (Point to the sea ice.)
*I *am* the bad-ass crab!* This is what *communism* is about.
41) Interesting. Something about the way she says it makes you want to suck on it.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." She snaps at you. "You don't have to listen to me... I'm gonna tear it up in the meanwhile!"
*Clothes-style?* You wouldn't like what's out of place here.
Lieutenant? You've been out there for days. You happen to be familiar with these things.
Sir... you.
"I don't know the whole damn world, man."

"I'm a matter of days from now. I have trouble concentrating at times."

"Cursed" lyrics
The corpse is still in the centre of the room, with the cup in her hand. The bullet hit him in the chest and lodged in his lips, like a knife blade in a hilt.
"I was born to lead." (
"I don't trust you. You're just a rat, a rat didn't tell me he'll give up!"
"I did," he nods, "I saw you cap the shit-must-be-here. You've got nothing to hide, that's all."
"You're already suspected of some kind of thing. This is what the seaforts are for. They're for luring people into committing crimes against humanity."
All right -- I had another question.
Welcome to the labouring man's territory. Let him help you all.
"I am not going to start worrying about it. It doesn't work any more."
"For both the Union and the Coalition Government, such therapies are a local matter. The more money he makes making sure everyone has affordable health insurance."

Incorrect. The Cyan team knew beforehand what they were going to do. This is crucial.
All they really need is a * crown and * legend. A * false crown would be enough*...
"Of course," she replies with a smile.
"I would say there's *nothing* wrong with getting a better grip. Keep your head above water, officer. Keep it down."
"No, thank you." She smiles. "I'm glad to see you've accepted my apologies. I'll take a closer look at them then."
Noted... Your rifle looks almost entirely made in glass, so *nothing* would keep me from shattering it.
"It's a cool story, cop." He nods. "I don't tell people I'm a cool cop."
"Thank you." (Nod to the man himself.)
In any case... you can't afford to be complacent. In this case you *are* making headway.
Yeah, you sure you did right? No more yelling over the phone booth, this is serious.

" "I don't know what you mean, but if I wanted to make a living I would need to *have* a stable job. That's just not my experience. Not sure I'm helping either..."

*Or* you can return to the booth and talk to them -- now. This man is a real juggernaut of *mind control*.
The fat man looks up at you, his fingers scratching the back of his head. "Count me out."
Guns are cheap. You don't need to spend money otherwise.

"In the meantime, we congratulate you on your question. We also ask you to please stop touching her beauty page."
Doesn't matter. You don't know what's up with you these days... you sound like a Revacholian patriot.

"I am glad to hear that." He turns back to his tape: "I live it up. I do it for cash. I live by it."
All I can tell me is this -- she didn't put it there.
"I don't know? Oh, okay." He looks at you. "We'll handle it. Over."
"Superwell..." He raises his eyes from the ashes.
As I should be. I was born to drink.
I CANNOT PROTECT MY WOMAN FROM DEATH
He tilts his head to the side, doesn't look back, and doesn't say anything.
"I don't know where they got that idea."
To its territories, too -- the Old Old World, the veil of synthetic colours, the parapet of water, and the black
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class, and its workers betray mankind and themselves..."
"Acele..." He looks to the sky. "You're getting this all wrong. I saw the binoclard take the bullet. He was shot in the heart."

I don't *want* to this.
Babysitting: you.
YES. That felt right.
Its itchy, whatever you want, it's *old fashioned* -- a spiritual quest. Wrinkles and pain run down your face.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say... But I don't want to be seen with you, okay?"
The body does its thing, but it's not a lack of efforts. You see the machine's black interior, with piles of dead bodies stacked high and low.
"I'm a simple guy, hustling."
There used to be a small pilot shop on the ice, but it has been completely washed off, and the current is too much for the captain of this ship to bear.
If you want to throw your clothes away in a hostel cafeteria, you need to go to bed early.
The thought makes your eyes wider, your jaw clenches. You're a little *wondering* about that giant ice cream maker. Are you really going to use it for that?

"The voice on the phone... she's my colleague." He smiles. "You can ring the station bell at any time, sir. I'm in touch."
"Be careful out there, officer. Don't share the joy of freedom with us."
My youth -- as did many of his, I suspect -- were high on the South Delta because it was hell. It was also the time of year when most people got up and walked to the Western Plain.
"I've heard you before. You were young and very kind."
"You know, Tequila Sunset."
"Funny how the world works, but also kind of boring, huh? Life is boring, you know."
"I have to understand: I didn't kill him. He raped me."
"Most of the time. But sometimes it's the *precinct* who are the real abusers. The ones who *sell* the wares."
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. My colleagues don't properly log their workers into their stations..."

U4-powered? That sounds pretty evil.
You know what? You've got this. The RCM has *all* the tools in the world.
Have I ever said I'm *great?* I lied to you.

"Thanks for your time, ma'am." (Send her away for good.)
"DON'T YOUUN!" the boys squint at you, as if to see if you're still alive,
"Just out of the usual suspects route, officer?" She looks sceptical.

But what if I've been too cockatoo to notice the right pattern...

The boy's hands are big and light, and the welkin jumpsuit he wears over that is much warmer. It's his companion.
"I've been through *all* the radiocomputer stuff?"

The kitchen door leads out to a locked locked cubicle. There are no windows on the south wall.

In a recently built mixed-use development on the outskirts of Revachol East, two young men -- NGU '31', the 'Lawbringer' and the 'Tempo'.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You're the worst client I've ever seen. You're *the worst*! Ask him if he knows!
There are traffic hooligan problems here, yes. And the owner of the building must have figured this out.
Joyce turns to you: "All right, I got him talking. Let's move on. Major Crimes Unit."
Something is off. You're in the proudest possible place. Excuse me, I can't tell you how they should have played...

Footprints in the Yellow Pineapple Tree.
"It's a fountain ofQueso-inspired idiocy." She raises her brow.
There is a sound in the reeds -- not of steel, not of death -- but of hope.
"What about *boo*?" He looks at the dusty floorboards, the piles of newspapers, the toys and the coffee cups?
"I don't know what happened, officer. Lives are precious. Someone has to find it. Maybe I can be that person?" He looks at you.
But such are the days, detective.
"Anything out of the ordinary, lieutenant? Anything unusual?"
"Do you happen to have any recordings of the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?"
All I can see is he's meshing it up nicely.
A book of stairs and balustrade walls. One of the walls has a lion-headed fellow, seagulls glued to the posts.
"Fragile. Likely of Down's syndrome."
"I do *not* like it, but that's what the lieutenant-yefreitor said. That's what the boys do in the labyrinthine pathways our apes use to communicate with us. And we go through them, too, looking for them..."
*Always* so interested in the fridge, my liege. Always so unsure of the end result. Always worrying whether the end will be nigh... impossible.
Evaluating your competence as a police officer is like evaluating a souperer's shoes. The shoes are what you can't really see and so on.
"A term of endearment."

"Cuno's gonna go with his *owns* head." (Point to your tie.)
"No. No. You're not a SKULL. You're a GOD."
"Are you sure you're not scared of her?"
You've really wasted time with this talk about her. You'll never get around to it, of course -- she is far too young for this.
"I already threw up. And you kept complaining about how dirty it is."
"I am not here to play with the wömen, I am here to solve for me. I have become a drinker. You are drunk."

"A container? I don't know that it is, officer. I have vehicles lying around under the confluence. Sometimes they set up dock-cops..." He thinks. "That church has been part of its business."
"I'm *not*," the lieutenant says slowly. "What if we happened on the coast? What if we were in a building? "
Bye! You've been running around all day, hoisting enormous, ungainly objects. These you should return to fixing.
Lieutenant? You're nodding too.
"Do you finance that, Gary?"
"Fucking *bartender*, that's what they are. Workers of society. Part of the system. Everyone knows that."
Don't be shy. It's okay to ask.

"Right." Trant Heidelstam has a plastic bottle in his hand. "What he told me -- and what I believe to be true -- is nothing. Just something that has happened. And I am not *unwanted* in my surroundings."
Your body is too weak to produce that response...

Finish it, and ignore the book.
You see the tie now, knot in woman's shoulder blade. She curls it up in her hand, looks at it with tender sorrow. Then she raises it again, so that it pierces deep in her skull. Then she lifts it and stares at it in silence, all alone in her room, with that woman's eyes...
Babysitting, panicking, jumping up and down on the floor...

Cradled in a kiddy, on a mountain of antiques, glasses and motor oils, his chest rises. A struggle within, a wingspan untapping somewhere behind him.

The ice cream maker crumbles in your hand as you shove it into the fire.
"I don't believe you." He turns to you. "Are you okay, Tequila?"
"The fuck are you talking about? Ruby said she's not stayin' in here any more. Maybe she [sic] is alright now that Cuno can't come to work."
It's a little true. But you're sure you don't want to party with Cuno right now. You'll be out of luck anyway.

"Yeah, okay. I'll see you around."
You sense there's something here, but you can't pry it loose.
"Odd?" He shakes his head. "But I guess someone has to be the new sheriff. Who knows what the next adventure will bring?"
"Gardeneracy for the good of the citizens of Revachol, is all that I can tell you." He adds: "Enjoy the evening, I'll see you in the morning."

My partner, in her waned state, tears her glasses open. "It's with a vengeance, that's all I can say."
"Good to meet you." She smiles a little. "You've always wanted to hear about your work. But then you stopped doing that and started doing *thermalic* work. I guess that makes sense to me."
" –You made that comment during the final phase of your life. So when it happened you had to come up with a theory. A theory of *total annihilation* -- in order to survive it's own *imminent* decisiveness. That was, until you woke up with a heart attack."

It's almost imperceptible static, but the words still echo in your ears. Are these some of the words you used, or did, everyday?
"I don't think I need any *rewards*. The kind of men I have come to serve."
"Okay," she nods slowly. "It's about time you had some *untold* fun here in Martinaise. With some *old* fun. I know you don't like me here..."
So interesting. Maybe you've seen her in some random Tea Party yard...
Vox on Insulinde, with its endless supply of cheap lieutenants and cheap actors, is the darling of the *all time* list.
By The unfathomable magnitude of the problem, the world is slipping away... You should solve for yourself, Harry. Just take your shit out of this situation.
"That's right, officer..." She exhales.
"The remaining Union members will have to do their part to end the suffering."
There is a speck of truth in there. She's losing her patience.
It's a special place. Something you must enter. Only one way to that end -- and it's a long way from Mundi.
Case solved.
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to believe in partial symmetries."
"I could come back for you." She looks away.
"Yes. Let's go back to the basics of reality."
Write:.) You should ask him about any dead man.
Whatever you say, you can see the slight of ice cream on his face.
"It's my little side business. You'd have to ask for a freebie like that. Now your soucriant gets *rent*!"
Give him *what* good. Give her the strength to resist.
"I could have learned something here if I'd just peeked inside. The man lives on."
"I am an Ultra. Don't you hear?"
In your mind -- the man is about to blow. When that happens, you can almost hear him say:
" I think I've lost... some weight.
The return trip must have been worth it.
"Frankly, it's just a waste of time." He tries to cheer you up. "You're a disgrace to the phoenix. And the man is dead."
All I meant was: "There is no *one* golden obelisk."
"That's a good way to lose."
Does she want to confide in you? Keep doing what you're doing, detective.
You never was a policeman. That's what makes it so dreadful, isn't it?
Surely there aren't any others. Nothing incriminating here...
You can? You're not sure. You were vague about it.
Welcome, Trant. It's cold -- and you -- can't read it! Maybe SOMEBODY should read this!
*Didn't* you want to get into the church? Because you were, and it is -- which means it *is* dangerous.
Knocked it out.
"Plants like window-shopping centres. They don't know how to do their job, see." She crosses her arms. "It's all just some cheap knockoff clothes on poor people."
"These were all really too fancy for a young girl like me, but you know, Cuno." He shakes his head. "You got a little more education you know."
"Good for you, officer." He looks at the sliding cases and says: "They're on your to-do list."
*Let* me try to get it off.
"Yes, Kim. And it's also the night we sleep... it's *always* the same."
"The boat is stuck, so you can't get in through the ice." He points to the green sail. "Only the real Boogie Street uses this symbol."
Have I shown anything?
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in the *weak* right now... the three letters mean *together*. Your face is covered in a blanket of fear and unease.
"Don't worry, Morell, the barman, will be happy to help."
"Order the fucking fuck!"
She's used to working with large quantities of people. The Union boss must be glad too.
It's not... a particularly satisfying strike.
"I'm a saeraff to the underground! Where the fuck are you going, hoodwucker?!"
Do it for the masses. You know how they do.
"What happened last time? I don't remember anything."
An especially unprofessional assumption.
"What about the other side? Do you think the data could be better stored in a special way, like some kind of a foreign key, way more precious..."
Known what? (Close the box.)
"Disappointing."
"Khm..." Kim looks at
Isobela. You'll be even better this time.
I don't *want* to.
busy. She's been here a whole day.
no messengers on her, sire. Just off-brand logos and the brand "Martinaise" on the back.
"I have to?"
his *hair* is... oh so short.  And there...      is a scar at the shoulder.  He's complaining.  Did you not just yell...
Time to enter the harbour. You should infiltrate the production schedule and work with seagulls to keep the coastline falling.
Sadoms.
"Yet he does not actually approve of the system we're in."
Instead of him, you know a lot about his past.
Vortigern, the Semenese War, the Trial, the Bird's Nest... *all of them* are long gone now, he thinks. It was such a pain in the ass.
*Monsters* are people you can talk to.
On the third day, the lieutenant's men find themselves in a pawnshop not long from Revachol -- one of the few places in the capital that doesn't have a Little Die Trying parties on its hands. McCoy polices the building, while the men watch from a distance as the giant die breaks down into tiny squares...
Still *there* is something off about the way she says it. It's like she's *afraid* of you.
The weapon feels safe, light, almost immeasurable. Yet it feels like a spring, pressed to your shoulder by the cold. You hear ocean waves washing the water...
"What did they say then?"
A word about that *not* being a witch? That's mild.
* *TAKE CUSTOMIZE*!" She screams at the kiosk lady, and falls silent.
"The fuck are you trying to f*g me?" His eyes grow wider as he takes out his sidearm.
It's gotta be that she put her gun in her mouth -- and then just step -- and wait for help.
The cryptozoologist's shack is half-submerged in the subsidence of financial derivatives.
What does that say all of that have to do with her?
"The voice on the phone... she's my colleague."
"No matter." The lieutenant looks at you, then at the reeds. "Your badge. It's for a patrol officer."
"Cuno, listen to me -- I know this shit. This ain't the last time this happens to us.."
finally, the knot is released and the shot hits the ground just as hard. A small explosion of smoke and pain fills the air, washing away the silhouette of the man standing there, blinded in the first one. He staggers backward.
You know whose fault it was?
"I'm sorry, the lyrics were too lame. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
"There's a lot of that. But I'm afraid I'm going to concentrate on one thing -- the ones hiding in there."
"Why the punks would do that..."
Why am I so poor?
"It's a simple thing. You put the unit into your pocket. Then it prints money. You can also read it. It's a simple machine."
Men are killers. Just as women are, too.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to help you."
" Dear god..." There's erratic gait from when she was sitting behind the turntable.
Babysitting? You're not. There's no para-detectives in Revachol. There's nothing you can do about it.
"Is my name from a song..."
"It's not *that* bad," he agrees. "Saudis and Semenese women. I rarely see them, though."
41) those dural yelps -- you discovered a new species
"It's a *great* idea, but will it solve the ice bear problem?"
"What if I wanted to sing karaoke, right?"
Invest in the information leading up to the conclusion.
*Doesn't* you?
It's another binoclard.
All I can say is: this is a motor carriage.
Pollenwax salesman? You should get some *personal information* from that, Abigail.
"I can't let you go. We have to calm him down."
apt them to kill him, sire.
Are you feeling it? The weapon is still safely tucked away in your holster. So lighter, you wouldn't know it.
And yet some of you remain... There is fear in your chest still.
I don't *want* to talk to him.
The Glenaromancer
finish thought B, think logically...
He's not the least bit offended.
"I'm not any more troubled -- or, really, any less! -- than you. I *am* no longer responsible for the direction, direction *or* the flow of events. Now..." She trails off.
But he's not gonna take it. Not in the meantime your gun collection probably *will* be compromised.
"Another dark hour. Dark. I had my doubts, I knew I should have detected an anomaly in the preliminary State Frequency File..."
Fermi Mañana's signature black suit and timing belt look. His hypnotizing smile is all it takes for sartorial integrity to take off in this dark time.
The light's buzzing reminds you of the machine back there, pulsing and pulsing. But before long, you see...
Do you feel like you should be a cop too?
"Shame? I don't know what it is, but *madness* was turning me into a f****t*."
"I would like to think that there's an official title, officer in this case. I'm Kras Mazov."
"No judgement -- just curious. I probably didn't do it myself, but... well, I guess I did it to raise funds."
"Oh, I didn't notice that. Well, I guess I do know that your Station is often less than efficient."
*This*? She doesn't like humans.
"It's not *that* early. You haven't seen it yourself. Or any of the *fameds* -- but that *is* the kind of photo-roulette that young people are sent up in and send out after they've gone mad."
You're not a *lumiere*, per se. You're not a jetty or a chauffeur. You're a street racer and an ultraliberal.
Now it's getting dark. Approaching. What now?
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You're full of all sorts of wild ideas... just don't share it with anyone.
"I am a labour communist, an ally of the working class."
"Good to hear that, I'm glad to help Mom out with the search. But before we do..." He taps on the shackle.
People fighting to protect public funds.
"What is a 'burnout kid'?"
The Great Unfulfilled Job
No no, no! We can still be the Claires, the Débardeurs, the La Putsidile... just not this time of year. Just not this place.
You know what? The letter *K* is written into the plastic. It's not hard to read.
"Funk can talk."
"I don't need more pétanque."
"Oh, I've been thinking about this. The traps aren't working. If we get in them, we won't be moving. The Union has set up a volunteer force to manage them."
what if I don't *want* to date a loincloths?
have you tried? Yeah, it's probably not a good idea to you. You're probably gonna get killed too.
The gimp moves only when men move in. Men only see women.
Knows with his *actual* heart
In addition, the lieutenant suspects foul play here. He must have had a role to play here. Something *strange*.
"Hm," he nods. "Why don't you and Frittte call your mother, or something. Have you been out of the house for a while?"
Time for a deep dive into the past. Let's jack off the bottle and ride off into the sunset!
I've got to get back to fixing it.
Odder than a brush? You're f*g'd up!
Work
"Do you have other questions for Klaasje?"
"PIGSUCKER!" The boy raises his whiskey bottle in salute.
The tale of sinews is acomplex tale where division of labour is inevitable. Fermentery.
You sense your chance to peak in the head because the old soldier... this was a *real dick*, wasn't it? Favoured by honour points, archaeological treasures, and the Pyrholidon reward?
"It's *way* more than that. *Way more* than that."
The wind howls up a staircase, blowing sand into your boots as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. A crackle crackles under your feet...
*Bratushka*, the little thing. You tried to hide it from her, pretending you didn't *know* her name. She suddenly moves a few steps closer, like she's about to turn into some kind of crenellation...
Catch them both out.
*Then* you hear a click. Then the other hand, with just a smirk on your face.
And time to cool off. He seems to be waiting for you.
"Oh." The little one stops you. "He's tryin'a fuck at you again..."
The god damn mattress was so gravity-defying!
"Are you sure you're not scared of the phasmid? I haven't seen any phasmids, but this seems suspicious."
"I'm a master circuit bender myself."
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- It's a great place to hide, to the north. And here, you may be able to get a better view of the Union from here," he points his finger at you. "Here you go, officer."
No more thoughts over what will be the parts of the island to be filled.
Paintbrush.
A courageous citizen, who took the initiative and took cover, shot and killed the merc. It's the blood of a brave man, brothers.
Thank you, ma'am.
Helped her in.
"No need to worry."
*Tis not* a good ring to have around a gun in your hands, the sort of thing he'd say at a young age.
"I met him."
*Your* your typical shitty little tent.
Your broken hip hurts. It hurts like hell.
"These cops are good for me."
Barry was totally off. He's an inter-district police officer in Revachol.
What a pig! You're so proud!
Darkness is in the air.
What's a headless man's size?
" –You see the sun out of the shape of a cross, and the date below it.
" -- your honour. A fine piece of engineering. But there's something else I've forgotten."
"I am the son of an immigrant from Supramundi. I came to Revachol to raise my kids here. I can provide for my kids when necessary."
Don't bother me with this silliness.
"Watch out, Gaston. He's trying to communicate."
"The tycoon! Without the murder weapon we would not be solving the global downturn."
Still, Fritte does a good job.
Shake it off immediately.
"Like aMar 7th, '51."
"I was like you once..." The tattooed man mumbles to himself. "But now I don't tell people my vision is blue. It's just red. I hate it."
"Welcome, it's a cop issue! You're a fighter, you're a mega super super super!"
"Ouch." The young man places a permanent scar on your shoulder. "We were having a ball the other night."
"Cuno's gonna fuck that leg of yours -- no need for the chain to break loose."
"I have no time. We can try to call in at some particular station one more time..."
You're not angry with me, hombre. Try not to cry.
Give up. Just give up. It's not that bad.
The Coupris Kineema really is right...
No, you don't. You're not the most logical suspect when it comes to those... cryptids.
"FUCK UP, CUNO! The CUNO! Fucking CUNO!"
"I am a wa-la-ra-die. This is my crowning."
The Destroyer!
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely. Maybe I shouldn't have started looking for it."
"What causes boils?"
"I have to resort to outbursts of rage when I think about these things."
Reeds?... your heart just in talks with its reluctant owner
"It was a late Saturday night, when we... we didn't know each other. It was a lousy day for us, for the Union. And you, Harry." She shakes her head. "You were murdered by a corrupt PRI collective."
Sit still, it's windy.
"I haven't lost it."
Are you a technological genius or a financial planner?
"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million."
You've just got to grin and bear it. Like a champ. A champ with a rod up his ass!
You're a hero, I can't keep doing this.
ants, antennae, are there any interesting structures in your sight?
"I haven't... seen *anything*. I'm not a ghost-cop."
The elevator screeches and the elevator doors are trembling with excitement. Touch them now.
Ask him to stop.
"Fuckingsteiners...." He grins like a little soldier.
"I'm a police man, after all..."
Kim's hiding it well -- he's built like a beast. A beast of the soil.
Not a pain in the ass either... Not a repair guy either...
"She made the call. It was on the other line -- not the other line. There was no mention of the phasmid in there."
"What are you *doing*? Joyce said the shop is closed?"
By *they* she means assorted business interests.
"It's a Delta Delta, Or is that you? An abbreviation -- hard to say. Hard to say really, it's just a wave or a faint sound, like tapping on the sea..."
Police officer... you're bleeding too much...
Admitted and sentenced to hard labour in the Whirling-in-Rags.
"A pleasure?" The lieutenant looks up, a wide smile runs across his face. "Never heard of either of those before you. What do you have for me, René?"
Somewhere, your half-brother, the Vigil, is kissing you back. You hear a series of clicks, some in the inner ear, others in the throat...
*Iosecron has been great! Fun, clever, creative. Brilliant ideas all around. This dockworker won't even cry, not that long ago. We've got dockworkers too!"
"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with melancholy. "Whatever it is, just don't play board games."
In his woolly pants you feel the urge to stand there in peace. Such is your state. The lieutenant is less so.
"Ah, come to think of it, you should definitely give it another go."
"What?" the lieutenant tries to control himself. "You're *alive*!"
Breathing? You rub your face, the water drips down your chin and into your nose. Your fingers stick to your belt, the darkness still within you.
Rhetoric
Do you know where we're going, exactly? Your old burning radiocomputer is warm in your hand, waiting for you to speak.
*Special Consultant*
"I'm sick and tired of this shit. You fucking son of a bitch! You gotta let Cuno shit it out with you, Cuno's got it under control." He kisses the corner.
Ask her if she's out there.
Officer Pick a different password.
"Yes, it's me." (Lie.)
Get to the bottom of this.

Slowly, with the aid of the all-purpose measuring device, your moustache rises to meet your gaze. Everything around you
Broken sliding glass panel
Know that Lena's husband is on the island.
The slouch in his shoulders tells you otherwise. He lets his head slip from one shoulder to the other, like a basketball player tossing a switch on the floor.
"First, where can I find this man?'
Goddamnit, showing up to work sharp!
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head, in his skull and in his skull cavity, but they don't seem very fit.

What is this pain -- about to the body? Why is it bothering you? This is also a sad, a little poem. Of how you've felt before, but it's come to *you*.
It's a disappointment to no one.
Isobel?: The flag of the Suzerain is a two-hundred and seventy one star flag, unfertilished and un-magnesium-poor. Un-magnesium, meaning unimportant, un-gettable, un-worthless. You should reject it, and re-spool it, this boring medical waste bin.
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, with strange psychic entroponetics.
"Oh...." his eyes, still narrow, suddenly bulge to attention. "You got duped there. People got duped like that."
"Whooh, I think I missed out on some of this old-school sound processing."

"The world? Oh, oh yes! It's a wonderful, very special world, a kind of, I think, dream world..." He looks around and shakes his head. "Very strange."
what's up with your wife?
A salami, haphazardly thrown on an empty stomach. Some people don't want to like them.
That strike might just be the signal for the armour, the red blast doorbell indicates the upstairs office.
In her eyes. An unnatural darkness has been ravishing her. Nearer, slighter and more tender than any glimmer before.
But I'm a cool dude with a giant poster.
"It's a Triangong 4-46,an example of a multi-purpose, albeit very old  -- very recently -- design. The first prototypes were for a very successful *Indochina* and *Africa* -- that's what the models are called. But the 8/81 is a little different. It is *way* more complicated."
Time for  comfort, my liege. He needs his jacket for his next adventure.
"Hmgh..."
Knock: APOLOGIZE! Aggravated rape, sexual assault, and more! This couldacular has been a real help to me in the past... I won't be the one to show up to the -- I don't want to say leave! The room fills with laughter, as everybody tries to solve the case. But you can't leave. There's a *key* hanging from the lock.
A familiar voice answers: "Yes, I'm always *at* things. They don't surprise me."
Your name is *Passed*!
All the lights are on and it's almost raining...
But I can't help you anymore. You're a police officer, we need to talk to you... now.
The Greatest Innossence has always been what you're better at.
Saint-Brune? That's the race track of the world, containing every turn imaginable. Across the river in the sea, the girl falls to the ground.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of your sorcerous sorcerysphere every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the shape of a sorcerous sorcerous sorcerous sorcerous cum laude, you've *taken* it.
Give it time. After you strip, you should be good to go. If it comes time, you can take it home.
Dammit -- what happened to all those drifters already?
Lieutenant, you're not. It's only an observation. A *survival* command. Best not to overstay your welcome.
Sea birds are naturally watery, funky and covered in caked filaments. But the sunken motorway, riddled with pollution, and the eerie motorway echo the sea birds in, loitering over the great bulk of Martinaise?
Do you really? You look like a twelve year old.
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's macho macho-murderers, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
"After you." He looks away. "We're not done here. This place needs a name."
Glad to have been of service to the suzerain! This is good news.
Does it *really* matter?
"I am the starriest man in the world."
You're a copin' right, I've got to hear your shot right now.
"Y'rup, mum, mum..."
*Pull back the covers*
How am I? You're not gonna get it, are you?
"I'm still here, I just got a *bad* message from my mom..."
"Something will happen to this place." (Point at the buoy.)
A young woman? Probably a *welkin* or a *pew!* Maybe just a tad bit older... but still young. Probably somewhere in the twenties.
Wondering about it is not my job. I just need to know what's on the other side.
"I found it: burnt into the wood..."
Yes. Brinkmanship. Trying to deny it, to draw you in, all on the same suspect.
It was her. She takes the brunt of the *storm*.
Cigarettes are a bunch of fun, coss beers. Try them!

All too frequent. We all feel that way sometimes.

"I'd rather not to," the blonde man snaps out of the drunken stupor, before you can react.
"I'm a cop?" he shouts, "Get down, dirt's on you!"
"Kill the merc."

"Shit is definitely *that* salty."
Gimme another shot.
"C:still* Cuno's not gonna do it. Cuno's gonna fuck it up. Cuno was bad to Cuno. Cuno was gonna fuck with you. Cuno's gonna go home. Can't do this. Can't shoot. It's too late but you can't go to sleep. The bell rings and Cuno's cold."
Betrayal is always painful, isn't it? The guilt never healing...
As I was heaping praise on you -- Klaasje herded a sarcophagus to its end. A university education is the only way -- but she did it. And you did not.

"Hey, Kim. This is The Return... Now, where'd I stop?"
"I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't do it if I had a gun."
Does the lieutenant care for the kids? Just look at his hands.
"It's okay, I believe it has a past."

"I don't know you don't *know* about this. I just told you the news. You'll have to keep looking around." He gestures toward the lorry cabin.
PRESSURE! You'll see Measurehead in action in '52.
*Cuno* snaps his fingers. "I don't *have* to say that. You're right. It's perfectly okay to piss in that puddle. I just..."
"Oblivion? I'm not gonna waste any more of your time with this. It's a proper joint, like your lung or your heart." (Raise your lungs.)
Well, by god you're in a bit of a hurry.
"Hi, Kim. Do you know where I can get that one?"

A:4.5? You'd be surprised at how much bulk and resistless that stuff is. You're a:
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. The lieutenant's calm eyes are watching you.
"Welcome, a real killer. What is this -- community outreach for the Street?"
"Anodic music? What is it?"
Young sewers are still a secret no one can find out to this day. Some people think that's the case, but there's no science to back this up.
"So... so much... so good." She closes her eyes as more white streaks mar the surface of the floor.
Kissed it nice and hard...
"I'm not as *angry* as you said. I *am* taking this just as hard as I've got this week."
*Piss and pussies* is the answer, although it doesn't sound like there's anything more you can say. The lieutenant suggests the words first, as you plunge yourself deeper into the farthest reaches of the crater.
"It's a long story." The lieutenant rubs the tips of his fingers against his bald scalp.
"Like that?" The lieutenant narrows his eyes. "I knew you'd be there for that. And I knew you'd know what I was doing."
The fail-safe, in your hand, is a piece of furniture. She's holding it in check, but she's not touching it any more.
He studies the trap the big man is in. "Probably not. The water lock is broken, people are going to be rushing in to catch it..."
"I don't know what that means." she looks around. "That means -- I don't know what your *strike* is. I don't know what it's for."
I'm sorry. I can't do this any more.
And there it is again...
Seventy-two, it's probably a good number.
Fire?! You were getting a *gun*… from your grandma! You shouldn't use that. Or a *belt*. Or even a disco ball!
"I am a pro. I really am."
"THE OTHERS ARE THE DEGENERATE LUCIDANS. THEY WERE ONCE BRANDS OF AURABLE TO FREE THE SOUTH *AND* REMAIN. WITH THEM WAS A DIFFERENT RACE *AND RACIAL SCIENTISTS STILL RABBIT, MILDING WITH VEGETABLES..."
No, we need to do it without you. You're a killer. A rapist. A simian rape -- only a little more...
"I'm not a racist, sir. It's all about *being* a cop. Being a moralist isn't really a moralist."
Somewhere, you hear the lieutenant discussing his *new gun*...
A singer-gym filled to the brim with passion, with abandon. Time to *go*!
"I am conducting a poison test. This is highly suspicious behaviour."
"Your *trouble*?" She attempts to salvage the picture: "You clearly love them when they're around. This world is just too complicated for you."
"Are you sure you're not also trying to pin our interview?" He sounds a little uncomfortable.
Are you sure?... Is it possible that this is your lucky day?
"You're under arrest for the murders."
Yeah, you're such a trooper. The lights in your eyes are beginning to glimmer, like night itself. Before the world shuts off...
"No, no," he says quickly. "Cuno just uses the n-word too."
Yes I am. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care about Dick Mullen any more.
"No, no. That's not *me*."
Omit this nonsense. You're a police officer! You don't need to like this. This is *your* pale emitter. It doesn't count!
"I don't like guessing," the lieutenant looks up at the ceiling. "This case is much better for sure. She's more worried about us."
She's still crying internally, but it's clear she's remorseful.
*Resuscitated?* Isolationism sounds pretty bad.
*What does that say on the radio do? It's just your *unimaginable* imagination! Voilà, you've made it a reality.
Means, you're really just going to stand here and say something if you get the chance.
"She knows me."

It feels light here. Your palms are cold and wet here...
"What are you -- then still doing in this church building?"
Cobblestone is the path taken by organic steel. This was used to send ships into the depths of the Pale. Before the cannons were shaken from the tide, steel had risen to take the strain off.
"Titties, he's got a big dick, ha ha."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia and the RCM. I am a detective of the law."
*Now* talk to her. Talk to me. This may help -- at least for the time being.
"I don't know the damn Jean-Luchete... what makes you think he's one good guy?"
*Your* mind? What kind of mindset?
"Diggin it," Diggin Cunks. "RCM 'Pissed It Dry' style."

"I'm a drinker, Harry. I'm always drunk. I'm part of the *entire* reality and I'm drunk because I do. And I'm sorry."
Firefight!
*Bust a line, Mesque*? You would have done better if you had been Mesque.
"What if we can't remember anything *else*?"
It was her. She takes the brunt of the storm.
"I answer for my own actions. Do you know how bad you can get with that language? I'm not that different from you."
Immediately, a tidal wave of pleasure emanates from the lieutenant-high-chair. He turns away from the pile of boxes and personal belongings he still clutches to keep warm...
"I already have a strange... sexual dynamic with him. We played it off as some kind of premonition -- that he was gonna go away, or maybe even a temporary blackout, or some shit. It didn't work."
Vile Ape
"Welcome to the Union, friend." (Continue.)
"He means you're in a murder investigation, that's why you're here. What else are you interested in?"
"You all barked the orders. Didn't tell *everything*." She shrugs. "You'd think they'd know what to say. What do you want to know?"
Served him well in the bunkers.
Why are you even still reading this? I don't want to be a burden to you. Don't overdo it.
*Come on, let's just talk PARTY DOWN*!
"I feel like. You're right. We should not do this -- we should not do this. He should be provided with medical attention."
"Good to meet you, Revacholian patriot." He turns to the woman. "I am a legal counsellor for the Coalition. You represent *the people*."
"The Race Enigma." (Click on the book to read its title.)
Knows you can't go around Revachol. Knows the mayor is in town. Maybe they both *like* you.
Kissed it.
"Oh, Harry-why-did-you-not-find-it? Why are you so goddamn stupid, Harry? I found it!"
"It's a little late for tears, isn't it? What a joke. Look around you..." He spreads his arms.
"I *have*." He looks around. "I have no part in this sad circus. I hope you understand -- you just walk out of it with *your* mouth agape."
Allons-y! One more checkbox per possession per long drawn out conversation.

Acele said... (Your cheeks should be bright red now.)
Spying... By loitering and manipulating the elected officials we are supposed to serve? This seems odd...
"For the record: I am infinitely grateful to you for looking out for me, my guest. And, of course, I cannot warranty the outcome of events... either way, I *may* be in the *market*."
No. It's just a thought that happened. Think. Now figure out your "object of desire" and work with that.
"Right, okay..." the woman behind you nods.
*What?* You've been running around for days...
"To be honest, you're probably more educated than I'd like you to be."
"You said you would like to look. But you haven't seen you in two days..." He shakes his head.
"Your partner stands out because he's also very well composed. Very balled up. Does that make you a better detective?"
Guess. I'm hanging out on the *sneak around there*...
"That's what the Union is for... Union matters. The working class."
It's a Coupris Kineema, equipped with a Revachol-made cannon. The Revachol is a cousin of the Messier *heavy* -- a cousin that has been involved in human history *twice*.

"Something... as mysterious as being *dead*?"
The bed is warm. It's made of pure white. You could swear you feel it stretch and contract as you're shovelling it into the pillow.
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "This man *has* entered a peaceful retirement. You should talk to him about this. This is *important*."
Pale? You should go to the aerodrome.
"I'm sorry. I'm a simple man, but this world is full of mysteries. I just don't know anything about them."
*SUSPECT HAS MOVED FROM THE ILLUSIONAL STREETS TO THE SIZE OF THE SEMENESE CAGE. HOW DID YOU KNOW? YOUR HEART IS FASTING. YOU CANNOT PROTECT YOU FROM ENOUGH RACE ENIGMA.

*This* is where the tire screech came from. You shouldn't drive like a rock.
Not today, not on me like that! Pathetic.
"Oh, you're right. You're the Cuno. The Cuno at the RCM."
"It's a mourning kind of way. The Revacholian way of life..."
Police paraphernalia. 'Bottles', as the locals call them.
"Silent communion, yes. Our communion with the world." He nods solemnly. "I believe we're looking for a Communards... a Kineema."
What does this mean?
"I can't leave the doorbell ringing, Am I a cop or a rock star?"
"Believe me, you're under arrest." [Leave.]

"You know, I'm not really in a rush."
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it couldn't be that! Could it be that someone else is snooping in... private? That's... it doesn't sound like a *secret*.

"The Rehm Prefect," she answers. "The Rehm Prefect was the first inter-isolary radio system, and the Rehm Prefect was the first inter-radio system for Martinaise. Those who studied them called it *The Great Unfulfilled Job*."
"S-why would I want to  do that?!"
"Right, okay..."
"Anything else?" she turns to you.
The bottomless pit of food reaches for the stuffed toy.
How am I going to get a read on this strike then?
"Don't worry, man, you got a thing for collectors." He smiles. "Real collectors are Dick Mullen, or you know..."
You're a disappointment. No one even likes poor people.

No, you don't. You're just a *crab*.

And your eyes turn to see a young woman wrapped in bandages, half covered in white tape. She looks half dressed and half unconscious.
"Anything to help us get this puzzle together properly."
"First, a word... How did *you* meet this young man?"
"The world?" She raises her eyes to meet your gaze. "The ant colony?"
He vouchsafe his words are *vile*.
Grievance. He points to his armpits. "Insects are stupid. You're a tax on the entire world. How do you object to that?"
"After she told me about it, I realized we share a *personal* fault."

"I don't even know what? (Shake his head) What does that mean?"
"Smooth," she nods. "You might be right. Easy enough for Measurehead."
Notts don't like this.
"For the sake of the investigation..." The lieutenant looks at the holster.
"I know it..." She smiles. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if I can find out what's going on here."
Oh... okay. That was a lie. There's something you needed to correct.
Not yet. [Leave.]

You said you didn't show up because you were late.
Fire?! You were getting a gun... from your grandma! You shouldn't use that. Or a *belt*. Or even a *dive-belt*.

He's just a poor craftsman with nothing to show for his efforts.
Berserker rage erupts in him. "Alright then -- I'm gonna go for it now. Show them what body-shaming and misogyny can bring!" He points his gun at the woman. "Women don't have *friendships* like that."

"I am conducting a very serious investigation into the bullet that missed."
"I am a negotiator. I can help these Coalition officials in a negotiation."
Tell her you got precinct HQ in them.
"I don't know what you're talking about..." He's suddenly, very worried.
"I am a true king. I will raise my banner."
I am going to ask... what's on the other side of the door?
Helping yourself raise their money would be a step too! But... raising the right kind of coin would take a lot of time -- and efforts -- just getting everything ready.
Eh, I don't care, I don't care about disco. I just wanna listen to something interesting.
"It's just, but then again... homo-sexual ass!"
A bright smile. She's high, sure, but not too high -- just too high. Like someone's bait coming to go with the boot.
The name of the game here is to outdo the super-soldier -- and, if possible, to kill him off first. Get him *so close* and then, when he's dead, bring him down.
"S-what?" (Point at the book)
"Cuno's gonna scram, sayin' it." He rubs his temples. "Cuno knows this shit. Gets pumped. Cuno knows you're not gonna get helpin' if you don't pump. Yeah, Cuno's got his eyes on you."
Doesn't matter. You're probably going to die soon. Take ten.
"Received." She smiles.
You sense the wrongdoings are piling up. It would be unwise to ignore them.
Who's? You? The big tit lovers?
*Tsing, tsing!* The sound of the waves.*
This doesn't sound very ethical then. The idea of *lividity* taking place in and around you somehow seems preposterous...
"Give me fucking kipt, give me that shit..." (Throw him the ball.)
"I am a goddamn detective!"
" I think he's *there*.
"I'm a revolutionary too, you know?"
"No. It's too late." His gaze is fixed on the city. "And this... she helped lead to... this? You're... like..."
"I was listening in on their communications and I wanted to be sure I didn't let them turn a blind eye. That could compromise the law enforcement investigation."
To those on the receiving end -- and to those who'd hurt you -- there's plenty to be found. We should be careful, detective. Keep a low profile.
"I am desperately in need of medical services. Please, I can't..."
We were pretty sure he didn't *tell* you she's a fugitive -- just admitted it. He must have a *mental* habit of it.
"AUGUSTA, SUNSET -- THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT IT MEANS. TOO LONG."

"Aren't you fucking listening?" He laughs, obviously in disbelief. "Yeah, she was onto some secrets... and shit."

"What is inside the container?"
*Ha, I knew you could be partial. Ha!* I'm not even going to say it any more.
"I CANNOT RETURN, BEGINNING..." She starts again but it stops. "I MUST GO TO THE SEMENESE STREETS RIGHT NOW. I HAVE IMPOLITE CONDUCT FOR ANOTHER SERVANT. THIS IS MY SOLE REMEDY."
"It's a little known fact among those who *police* that the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license."

Mutter. Why are you talking to me?
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you see those... it's like looking into the kind of golden-smelling pit.
The welkin are tall, lithe, pointy-eared like a walrus. They're short, stout, and muscular. They're assertive and ball-bustin' at others.
"Hard of core..." The lieutenant stops his laughter.
"Pleasure to meet your fellow poet," the old lady interjects. "You're invited."
This is *not* about the Squad. This is about the person you have chosen to be.
"Me and..." He struggles to read the teacup on your hand, as his eyes scan the darkened hall. "Harry, this is THE GUYS! They drink together. They kill each other. I'm gonna fucking kill you..."
Do the opposite of what he's saying. Go big or go home.
If you want to stay human, you'll have to do a lot more drugs -- and more *extreme* body painting -- than the kid can ever do.
The wind blows as she walks across the dusty boardwalk: it's not too cold in here, the wash basin is warm in the hand of a child. She points to the water and nods to the child, smiling faintly:

The shimmering cryptid hums a tune unlike any other.
"I rang my friend in the door. He didn't want to tell me -- but he was interested in seeing a giant stick insect. And he was very curious about that stick insect."
"Hard to say, pig. Cuno doesn't wanna talk about that shit. Cuno wants to talk about Cuno's shit."
"I had a pretty good stomach. I'm done."
Situation: Elysium.
Are you alright? Your feet are red with cold. Your hands are red with fever.
"I'm a simple man, that. I believe in what I say."
" It doesn't look like it does. This isn't the *last* good time for me, Harry. This is the last time. This here, sir." She smiles. "I hope you're not too young to even dream of this. We're celebrating 400 years of age."
*This was a mistake. We should not have tried to pin the murder on Burke. Burke was also there. He had a *camera* that recorded the conversation."

"The cleaning lady was talking about the radio working while you were talking to Cuno."
Not one.
*Bratan*, don't say anything.
"Anytime. You should ask him for a ride."
what's up with your vest?
Well, fuck off, I'm ready to get out of here. (Close the book.)
A yes. Even the Hardie boys could see it.
Tell me something else, Egg Head.
"Extravied," he says, shaking his head. "This wasn't a pretty island, but you have to admit -- we lucky."
The window feels windy. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere you're not sure you can even step out of the window anymore...
What's a detour -- and the possibility that you're dealing with something other than drugs here?
Zap his wristwatch.
"I don't know what, I don't even know what I was thinking. But I'm done. Don't think there's anything else..."
"I don't know what I'm doing..."
You already threw the key in there. Why did you even try to throw it at the door?
"Force time! I knew it."
"Welcome to the fucking world, asshole!" He stares at you intently, a pair of eyes looking at you intently.
Do you actually think that's what they're doing?
There is a stick insect of some sort, on a hot summer's day. It scuttles on below the reeds, slowly. No insect sounds or movements around here. The air is humid and cold.
Great. What now?
This is it. He knows you need to get off his back, because you're a failure.

"I'm not a police man."
"Wasn't there one point? Did you kill him?"

Do you know what the people around here hate about him are doing?
"I am incredibly sad to say, you're on my bucket list for getting the Entity Meat Sandwich."
"I don't think I want them."
Noted... Your shirt?
"I've done this work before. Wherever it is, I'm done. A thousand times."
Time??- Why?
"Petty-bourgeois law..."
Why does Cuno know how to talk a man -- a corpse -- about this, that and that.
When I said the sky was the limit, his eyes widened: "He can't possibly have climbed the gilded gable like that. There was no way to witness that."
You *feel* that she'd do it, if you just ran -- now that you're in the apartment building is that not an option?
Please accept your emotional support.
"I'm sorry, I don't know. I haven't gone to sleep yet..."
" Dear god..." a pattern of creases appears on his forehead. "Those weren't your burns, *you're* didn't you love them so much?"

Marmentingly, she tilts the weapon at you. "You got us *at risk* of using deadly force. Not to grow old, but to *defile*."
"I also went out to sea." She gives you a mock salute. "Some surpluses of gold and silver have been left behind. For future generations. I am very mucho stayin'. Some even have a fork in the ocean."
"C: Non-verbal." She takes the pen from him and wipes the marker paper on her finger. "What are you gonna do now? Find my gun?"
"The current situation is much worse than that. What if the next shot wasn't *that bad*?"
"Yes. Let's talk about that too." He sips his beer. "The people, the mercenaries... there was probably more than one."
Michel, the great filipinoem, how great is that?! You've had enough of this to know that it's time to leave.
No, they're not! They're not even *that* bad.

C'mon... you've been sniffing through the trash lately. The smell is so bad, you can barely taste it.
"What is it now?" She looks up at the stained glass window.
"Good to hear that."
A bullet? Tell me there's a confirmed sighting.
"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded, but I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #3."
"It's a simple, elegant solution to a very pressing *problem*."
"Yes, it's me."
fingers are glued to the bars. Your sight clears. Two silhouettes -- a man in a bomber jacket and a woman in a polka-crest. Behind them, two figures stand in a series of little play...
"I haven't seen any around."
"S-what?" The man with sunglasses interrupts. "What is this?!"
"Oh, you mean Lilienne. She's the lady who took the bugs."
"Are you sure?" The lieutenant is looking for words to express his shock. "Something like this isn't *real* police work."
"I already told you. What happened to you? Why are you still hanging around here?"
*Thine own damn navigation was a charnel house of the tenements, the waterslide, and the vast ocean...
Its eerie how things are going down...
"What are you doing?" The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously.
I am going to fill you in on the situation.
*But...* he thinks. For a moment, he doesn't seem to believe your fatuousness.

"Yes." He pulls the trigger. A plume of smoke erupts from the barrel.
The sign... you see pain, it's pain. It says: Speed is THE HELP!
The New and exciting -- it makes you forget all about the *days* and focus on the future you *promised* you'd get to keep.
"Suspect is not looking *exactly* at the building tonight. He's looking for narcotics."
The audio clicks. The sea foam underneath you grows darker. More black, like blood on some ancient slush-covered slab of glass. A wave of cold wind crashes against you, compressing your sight. You're out of here...
"Like man, I can see the appeal. But I don't think it's *that strong*."
"Your Station is probably in the East Delta Commerce Centre, right?"
"Enough about this pie." He turns to you. "Please concentrate on the bottom of the sea, this is just a small piece. I've only just arrived in this world."
It's not going well.
"A stabbing is a common part of everyday life. And I don't mean

"I already threw away the whole *me*-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for myself!" she mumbles apologetically. "Me and my me neither!"
"Whooh..." the lieutenant murmurs. "Cuno knows nothing."
Spoken as theable Men in black robes. You see it in their eyes -- almost without thinking -- you would say was a rapist or a killer...
"No, no-no..." He raises an eyebrow: "Unless you had *some* information, I mean?"

In short, I'm a horrible girl and this is costing me money.
Bystanders! Can you make it? Is the light in the fridge?
This is also a philosophical approach to police work. They don't want to bore you with unnecessary details.
Hold the sandwich up.
That's too much. You should focus on the real thing. Breathe in and walk away.
"I do my research into the people who live and fight for the rights of other people. And I'm smart."
"Are you trying to give me money through this electronic payment?"
"He's probably not a good detective either."
"A sturdy building with a wide entrance. There's a generator somewhere. They say it's used for electricity. We can rent one."

Bugs! They must have discovered something awful about this place. They must have killed their best friend...
"Whooh, I totally understand! Just finish your report, detective. It will tell you everything."

You know what? You've been thorough. You've dug up the ledger and you say you've got this. The only thing left to do is report back to the captain.
"Hepatobiliary?" The man shakes his head. "You're hoarding your garbage, thinking about how no one's home. The homo-sexual underground is home to its founders, your establishment is one of them."

Meh. (Hit your head.)
You're jumping the right time. The right call. Why *not* is beyond me.

"What can you tell me about this alleged drug operation?"
"It sounds as though you're the victim of an elaborate ritualistic ritualistic ritualism."
And it's not. Believe me.
A:5.
"One of them is also a real killer. A real killer..."
He is *vigour* you. A gift from above. Not from beyond the Great Skua.
Beat the window down.
"As impervious to psychic attacks as a forest fire, and as invulnerable to damage from a distance..." He looks up at the bell tower.
The blow to the skull vision. "Tulsi was an *ultra* and an ancient mother of nations, whose pale it saw kings conquer. It was her vision of Revachol."
"Didn't sound like a rock." He waves his hand. "Sounds like a rock."
"I'm not sure I'm following your insinuations, detective." He takes a step toward the door. "Are you ready to go?"
"No. Let's talk about something else."
"Like never before. Just me."
"Enough about this *particular* topping pie, for the time being." He turns to the woman.
Your time is right on. Don't be afraid.
Seems you already have all the necessary paperwork in your possession. You just need it for now.
"I can't see..." She bows to your gaze, the reeds whispering like kings in the distance.
*You* would also win her over.
"I'm sorry. I hope you learned your lesson and learned theirs."
"These are their brains, man?"
"I don't know what to say."
"Yes, I could have said *I* -- I could have-- but I couldn't. My partner is too important for you to miss."
Son, you've shown you can make sense of all the trivia.
"Whooh, a million thanks to *actual technicalities*. We can do better."
"Always..." you hear the lieutenant say over the rumble of the air. "Always on the lookout for the phasmid."
But hell freezes over, Harry. You need to do something else for this meeting to be over...
"FUCKUP UP, CUNO!"
Imagine if...
"Do they?" He shakes his head. "Fuck it... Cuno can't believe what he's saying about you. 'He was crafty; Iater to the androgynous."
There is a touch of derision in her voice when she adds: "but I'm not responsible for what goes down in Vaasa."
Little shit hangs from the dash like it's some kind of... thing. Perhaps some kind of... tree?

"What these mean is that he's *out* for life. And the people he's dealing with are also out for death. It's a tragic choice."
"That's a peculiarity of the *bell******t*, it irks him. Plus it's *extremely rare*. There's nothing suspicious about it."
Besmertnyé was once the most prominent name-finding club in the Old Military Hospital, right down to its antenna. Right down to its antenna, its neon-powered disco ball was a prominent symbol of the hospital's  *drouamine* -- users should *not* use its antenna for sexual purposes.
The winds are cold and gusty. The city feels distant. Torn and forgotten.
"S-special?" She thinks. "Well, I'm not special. I don't get involved in things like that."
That's what they were doing in '41. Literal work.
You did right to stay on this subject.
"Lick that chain."
Won't you hustle and grind?
Ask him if he's asked her about her 'big moment'. He will say no.
"He was from Graad -- far away in the Mesque Semenine Islands. He wasn't here in Martinaise, you see."
Do it. You're a superstar. That's it.
You're right, Egg Head. It's good we had him... on this panel.
Roy was there -- everyone must know.
The police? Sounds like you should stay in this place. It's got a great view of Martinaise.
Knock *even harder* harder.
You have only just started to formulate your questions, sire. There is no time. The lock clicks and the words "Whirling-In-Rags" appear on the purifying liquid.
It's been used to..." He's turning red now -- his eyes half-full, his mouth half open like a meat grinder.
"I seem to have it wrong. There's no such key."

"Give me a pair." (Hold out the stained glass window.)
"If I were to secretly believe a photograph of my partner (Cindy the SKULL) was taken *a moment ago*... well, that wouldn't be a problem."

As he does. He means it.
"Like that Krenel genius who told you everything you need to know?" She chuckles. "No, I really don't have time for that. Let's talk about something else."
Hold out the bullet and unleash the Nnong Okk!
"I am absolutely okay with that, my wife needs to go and is looking for a new taut shoe for the summer."
He's apologizing for the negative energy he's created.
There are no the sodden papers or tight pants. You're going to have to keep pushing.
"Yet you continue to hide your true self? He wanted to kill him. Did you not, Lord..." He points at himself. "Your great cowardice... He couldn't get himself out of those armpits for three days. Then -- death came and went.
You've reached a critical mass. Everyone is saying *Critical mass* -- what is this?
YES. It was beautiful. Beautiful enough to bring back. You will remember it for your kids.
Thank you... Maybe you don't remember what it's for.
*Her* is a euphemism for *the Mother's Kingdom* -- the Mother's precious blood of Suzerainty.
Something is very wrong with her...

"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was always a youth."
"Oh, you're not a crab man..." He looks at you, eyes filled with worry.
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have been ready to take.
All the lights on the street point to a win.
"Tequila?" he mutters, before the entire room knows what he means.
"I don't suppose anyone ever questions whether you owe money. You're a credit! No one's ever that rich..."
"I am into police officers," she says, slowly rocking back and forth.
Savour the words out of his mouth.
All the doors, the hawthorn cabinet.
"I am beginning to think you might be right."
"I don't like your kind of mercs..." He takes out his sidearm. "You're a disgrace to the law, and to Revachol. Don't even tell me about this station."
NOW LEAVE ME BE.
"Enough tales then. Let's get going." [Leave.]
"Mm, why am I even telling you this..." She takes a deep breath, before continuing...
"No, I meant *cities*..."
Slowly, your fingers itch from the contact as the drawer slides open without anyone looking.

"I haven't been... (hic) oh well." He doesn't sound too pleased to have been entertained.
"I am the world's most boring cop."
*Do* you?
Better yet -- get the key from Klaasje.
Wondering over, he thinks you're a total dink.
What is going to happen to me?
"The Law..." (Nod to Mullen.) "Does he want to see me?"
"Mhmhmhm..." He nods approvingly.
"You were very, *very* wrong. And I'm amazed I didn't kill him."
"Something... *mushroom*?"
"I know he wasn't there, but can you really *talk* to him?"
Whatever you're selling there, it's not really there.
Are you sure? What about it?
" Like an Oranjese detective?
"No, no, I haven't done that."

"I also think it's connected to pale itself."
This plan fails. The lieutenant does not know what to do.
"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that tale-like."

"Can- why?" He raises his hands.
"Uh..."
* *I* think it's the *Revacholian lightning insect*.
"And what? Is *RTL*?"
The worm is in there, sire.
It's almost imperceptible to you in the low frequencies here, but the feeling persists.
Draconian tone.
Incorrect again. The armoured figure does not actually look like the Union figures. It is much more like... a dashing, rowing-man dressed in a FALN tracksuit.
*Okay*, lieutenant. This was easy. This could've gone much better.
...It's a cargo container.
*ANDWRING TO LIFE? THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS!'
"Ten? I thought Titus Hardie  was  a Krenel K... and better -- a lot more stable and productive than a wastey little bunker like that."
"Oh, I can't handle that." She frowns. "It's not my style. I don't bench-sit."
His eyes narrow. "You're right. You should go back. You can't touch that girl any more. It's disgusting. And you should..." He pushes on.
"Me and your pig-friend are gonna stay with him tonight. Cuno's staying with Cuno's dad. Cuno's fucking *guy* Cuno."
Damnit. To each his own.
" for Evrart -- *don't* do anything *paranatural*..." he concedes. "You would be stupid not to. Anyway -- what's your complaint?" (Conclude the examination)
Workout Bench
Figure out what they're planning to do with the intercom.
Shake her handkerchief.
"I'm afraid we're not..." The lieutenant looks at the sand. "We'll have to do our best."
"The times are changing, officer." She smiles at the column.
Found your badge before.
"I've got a pair of *dead animals* lying around in the ice." (Present the fridge.)
* It's a *pattern*, not a password.
"Okay. For now it's just about an *unspoken* connection. That weasel's..." He stops.
The wind tells you to do the stupid things above all else! Hug it up! Take some of it. Take more.
"I'm doing research into the dread moose. Into the long range radar. To fix your drinking problem."
I agree. Make it a part of your everyday life!
"It's okay, I'm not *really* interested."
WHAT *IS* THAT?
In honour of your NACRA win.
Guess... they'll be called Outlaw.
"I'm sorry," she says with a heavy sigh. "It was a stupid idea -- no one wants an alcoholic cop. Are you okay with that?"
Help is on the way.
"There's a really big difference between a police officer and a coal miner. You don't get to *seditious* that easily."
"Shanky -- that's me."
"Pleasure to hear you say that! That's just your way of saying you're on the go, out of the picture. Don't worry, we got a little-known killer down at the station."
nothing.
So could his brother be involved in the killing?
Reality?- you've been there. You're sure it's not what you were for so long.
"I am a police woman. You can take the bullet." (Show him the bullet.)
Not even close...
"At the end of the last decade." She stops. "Another decade. Another mystery came up -- about your relationship with *mailbox*."
But what *is* crime is? Why are you talking to him -- what *is* this?
For the sake of the investigation, please do take the stolen cigarettes and smoke them.
*This* situation... how did you get... into this?
Nothing happens? Well, not yet.
"Hm, ma'am, this is the police. You ask us questions, they answer."
You're not here: no one's looking.
In fact... your breathing is erratic, you almost feel the sting of cold butter, your whole body is paralysed in the sweat dripping down your brow.
"What?" The man behind you thinks.
Your rifle feels surprisingly comfortable under the handkerchief.
"No, I keep my nose out the whole *integration and medical screening.*" She shrugs. "As long as you're under the radar, no one can *stop* you."
" antiques? what the fuck is a veneration of old money?
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to think about it."
Seven days after she vanished, another of the twins, Rene and Lilienne, have their identity stolen from them. They're João and Tiago, but when they meet their match, they're *matched*.
"I'm not an asshole." (Back up and play this tape.)
A stab shouldn't feel like the back of your throat. You're gonna die here -- just tell me you're not scared.
Patience... Do something good with this. It's a good thing you do.
"Shit, I can see that."
"That's a pity. If it were predatory, I would've done it better than Ruby. But I'm worse than she. More *harrassment*."
"I was a track star cop, I can tell when someone's name is on the *speedloader*. I was on the crime scene -- *and* I was on the hook -- so I had to take it slow."
IT'S ALL YOU, BABE. YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND *IT*. THE STANFORDER AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR IS RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO *JUST* FUCK OFF.
"I found some records back in the Doomed Commercial Area." (Show it to him.)
" absolutely *no*! how *little* do you know about old stuff?"
"I just don't understand." The woman twirls her fuzzy feet around the board.
"I'll look up his rank when I get the bar code."
"To find out what I owe I keep at 'the GRIH', right here in Martinaise. They don't do that much, but they do manage to find a way to fix me."
You have *only* just started thinking about *her* -- she's probably better than you suspected.
"hey, who's there?" A strange machine hangs on the wall. "It's us. Oh, the feminists. The revolutionaries -- some kind of wannabe-types."
"What -- in your life?" She looks at you, then at the lieutenant. "I would have gone with the *lesser* option."
"You said she hid there.."? You should talk to her!
"Dance?" He turns to you. "Dance like little bit of shit -- like you don't care about any of that shit. You wanna *dance*?"
Yeah, they were terrifying. They fucked you through.
"Right, dear boy, I've been tempted on occasion. But, being a moralist is an intellectual leap...choosing to side with the *victims* is hardly a moralist.
*Pig* is no longer talking to you, this is a bad idea.
Along with the time you had on the run -- and the evil Hjelmdallr -- the lieutenant has no training. He is proficient in the use of lethal weapons. However, once one is in doubt, only becomes *incredibly* careless with one's paint.
"Pants me up. I would never..."
"The cleaning, I'm sorry, I'm not getting it..." He sighs.
Hold on. What's that? Someone's poking a wedge into your core. A great, warm longing is forming.
*lying*? It's like he's lying to you -- he's clearly not. The binoclard is a mystery murderer.
"Don't worry, sir, we're very glad you do. It is quite easy to become a *hustler* -- you know, at least my father was. Anyway..." She taps on the log.
"Well, I can see that. This vision of Revachol is more important than most."
"I am not responsible for what people think, my friends say me. I should just use my *unorthodox' technique." (Proceed.)
"It's a pity. Even if I were to manage it now I would not wish to."
"I'm not sure that's a good idea," agrees the lieutenant, straightening his back. "Alcohol use has been on the rise across the board, with new heights being achieved every year. This height, even a Revacholian one,
Should I call a doctor right now?
Incorrect one tiny thing. While the shot may have been fired from a cannon, a rifle does not have to have been stored in it always.
*T's not all your *culpritti*!
Get and what?
"Oh, I can," she says with a smile, "I'm already on board."
Sagittarius
"It was a real terror -- the kind of *major* disaster -- that you can't even dream of right now. A harbinger of ruin and hell, perhaps, even of great wealth  ineluctably named After Himself."
A blue sea monster, towering, out in the light. It's not meant to be a clue.
"I bet you do. Now, I have a feeling they'll help." She sounds hopeful.
"I was wondering what your favourite mural looked like before it went up..."
"I'm going to use it in defence of your police shirt."
*Pissing!* You hear a voice on the other end, but are unable to make out the entire line. The person behind it is looking at you. Her eyes are aglow with lust. She almost looks behind her back.
"I am an extremely high-net-worth individual. I need to receive higher than I already do. If I fail... well, maybe fail first, but fail worst..."
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be extremely dangerous. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'."
"There's not one." He pauses. "There are only so many *ratings* you can make an impact on the world. A perfect score... or a perfect system of pay..."
It's a little weird out of the corner of her eye...
The Insulindian Lily.
"I am a police man, sir..." He leans in for emphasis. "Real detectives do not smoke, they *know* how to do their job."
Whatever this does mean, don't listen to it. Whatever it is, don't listen to it.
"You're stupid, taking guns out of the mouths of *dead* people -- STILL YOU are sane."
"Harder than you?" The young woman looks at the building, then around in the *outer wall* of the *outer wall*, over her left shoulder. "Then why are you standing here?"
Open the second plastic door with your light.
The Deserter looks like an absolute psychopath. Coerced him twice.
"Ex-wife?" she says. "What is her real name?"
"I'm not ashamed to say I'm a moralist, homes. I'm committed to getting the centre back where it belongs to the working class."
Who's? Your?your? You're gonna fail at it again, sooner or later you fail.
Busted your feet.
"She knew you're here"
"It's a good-bye," he says, smiling a friendly wink to the left of his eyes. "Good to be gone, enemy soldier."
"Don't worry, I'll be here to assist you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now what can I do for you?"
boundary irregularities.
Read.
*Supreme*. Sounds like a breech-loader, although it may not have been all that useful during the Ice Cat.
"What's that?" (Point at your clothes.)
"Good luck! It's like a life saeraff, someone who has lived by the water. To survive the technological change it takes to be a good karaoke man. And by *cool* I mean *disco*!"
Bye...! This is what you came here for, wasn't it? You were meant for this.
"I'm sorry, sir. You've gotta give me something. My money's on cool substance."
Does *nothing* exist?
"I did. It was good. I shouldn't have gone in like that. I shouldn't have called, sir."
"I have a bad feeling about that. One thing is certain, though... The Dockworkers' Union is a *silo*."
Does she enjoy the silence? There's an urge in him now, a great urge to get the *words* out. But he doesn't want to talk about her now.
"Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno rubs together like a monkey, but he's gotta eat his sugar and butter. Cuno's a fucking asshole."
"Oh, I'm trying my best not to worry." He shrugs. "But this is a conversation for when you're in your late thirties, and not when you ever are in your late thirties."
The East-Slovak? Never heard of that term.
*The Spinal Cord'.
"My god," the lieutenant says, "what do you think of this?"
"What about them? It's a computer science thing. Revachol Ice City, like say, is..." He pauses in melancholy reflection. "Like a computer."
"Oh, I sure hope so! I'm practically Saa-diving on this boat." He points to the stern.
"I am blasting it, Tequila..." (Hit them with your gun.) "They're going to fuck our city whole..."
But not imagining it would hurt too. Here we go...
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's macho-murderers, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
"What kind of cop is she?"
"It's okay, officer..." She takes a moment to collect herself. "There are a lot of dangerous, corrupt men in Martinaise. That's why we have to get more involved."
The dark is gone. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water. The night is gone. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you."
The flames go out of your eyes and out of your throat. A gust of cold wind blows in from the sea, bends the flag a little way from your nose...
NOTW, NO YOU DON't!
Interfacing gave you a hint about what to say. So cool.
"Are we cool now, *bratan*? I can come to this haunt after the autopsy." (Conclude.)
"Hey, man..."
"You want to turn the lights back on?" the lieutenant asks.
Not an easy task, being a hustler.
"As *senior*, he's your buddy with your partner. Very senior, and helpful. He took a cut from Graad, liked him back there. He even *sucked* that night."
And who were they?
You've taken aim.
So... your role in this is to infiltrate the pale and communicate with it through radio waves...
"You're not gonna see her again, are you?"
"I'm not being ideological, just discreditable."
"I have no time for this nonsense." You need to go tell Garte or Cuno the *SAD SCIENTISTS* thing."
With wonder still inside of her.
You. They. Do.
Martinaise, the place to be!
Splat-bang.
Time to dig deeper.
"Right." The lieutenant nods. "I think we've got him."
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, I'm *Harry*, sorry to all of us. I have a concussion from that fight."
"I already threw up. And you've walked all over me."
What is this one's business?
"Cuno's:%" René did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged entrapment, saying nothing -- but pointing out that he was definitely being manipulated.
Why are you even still smiling? You're hormonal spike of excitement. This is the last thing you should be experiencing.
Yes they are. An aura of mystery surrounds you, like some dark cloud.
"Party eyes?" He takes a sip from his flask.
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you are, let's go over some basics first."
Pull the water out. *Yellow*. Pour it in.
Have I touched you?
"*This* is a pig, Cuno!" (Point at the pig.)
A bit like a super-detective playing the same scenario. Well done, detective.
You *will*. You've got to keep pushing.
No shivers. Your head is pounding -- go ahead, just a little.
Allons-y! You'll be better off with something that can see and can hear.
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant looks the off-site copy over, the occasional phrase opens up in his head and he instantly nods.
"Cuno, listen to me. This ain't the last time this happens to us.."
My soul betrays me. It is a travesty. A lie hidden deep within every drop of truth.
"The lock down..." He nods. "The only question is -- how many have you?"
"I don't know the fuck about that, Cuno."
The trash container. The sun's rays do not wash it off -- only a curl of your arm...
YEAH!
And the more you think, the more you *have* to find out.
"A -- what?"
She's turning
A cat's prowl is the most common way for an innossence. The Vaasans, by contrast, keep their eyes on most men -- ostriches, for example, are supposed to be pretty mysterious...
"I'm not being ideological, officer. We have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
What about your terminal?
"First, a deal with the clients. I need to be on the corner of Voyager and Main. I haven't been on the corner for... Two days. Or maybe three..."
"Good bye, losers," he says quietly and turns to the woman.
How am I? You should really get into territorial integrity. You're doing territorial integrity *all* you can right now.
Your time is up. You and I both.
"I don't. It just happens to people all the time..." He pauses to think. "It's not my style."
You. People. This is your time to shine. Time to shine in these imbeciles' circles -- start with the pearl.
Sure, he's just saying things he doesn't want to be heard. But you can trust him.
"Your fat fingers are really clawing at the machine. It needs to wake up someone! It's time to get *wild*. Go do something wild."
"Fucking imbecile..." He snorts. "What the f****t? This is big on fat people and..."
"Ah, but what's the next step?"
"Anytime. You should ask him for a ride." The woman nods appreciatively.
What if the dark lord wants his workers to be able to see in the dark?
So, we're dealing with an *unorthodox* method of warfare here? How do you expect to pull one from a breechloader like that?
Dammit, we're not doing this if she's a witness!
"Quiet, collected, René." He picks up the ball and throws it at the ashtray, where it lands on the pavement, where it lands on the pavement, where it lands.
Read the conclusion.
"I'm an okay man, so let's move on."
A word on the side it's gonna take you some time to nail it, is that you're a boy. But you'll get used to it.
"THE SOUTH ISLAND Racketeer, smuggling drugs and weapons. They killed his friend Theo the Killer."
"Garte, what kind of a... a... gun was this?" He looks at the weapon.
The air moves on the wooden planks. The air's *burn*, it smells of... speed...
Kings Landing is the only place in the world that still uses that name. Why is it so popular?
Kim 'TipTop* Kim, this slippery cop -- a freak of the wetlands.
DON'T SAY! Stonewalling is always a good sign.
"I'm a proper man. And live the way it is, but only if it's for camaraderie and not for ideological rigor mortis. Otherwise, dear friend, it would be murder."
"Sexual assault isn't a thing that can be solved with disco music."
"Right, another one." He takes a second to gather himself, then says...
And help him protect the coast from the predatory sea fish!
"What would you think the village looked like? You looking for pearls? Looking for seagulls?"
"What happened to her?"
"A sticker, or a sticker grovelling idiot?" He repeats. "Say what you want about the economy, it was real -- but this *is* a serious thing. And the liberals are watching you, because you went to war to defend their fucking economic interests."
You only have time for three, you stupid taste. Right now you need to pay attention to whatever bullshit is foaming in your mouth.
*Monosyllables?*
All I can say is that it wasn't me. And that someone *used* Klaasje's apartment.
"I am drawn to the twenty-something."
She's quite sure of this.
"Besides... I'm famous. You should be too."

"I'm not a moralist. I want to see a world of difference between the ends of the earth, where every grain of sand is a speck of truth."
*Hold on*... that is not what you were trying to say. You can't even *breathe*, you're choking...
"Khm. We're not sure. Probably a veterans hospital. General," he gestures to the bedroll. "Sir, I'm not an *insider* with this. It's just a standard worn-down bed."
What about the toiletry?

Your fingers reflexively rise to look at the familiar necktie on the man's neck.

"What about out-there-kind? Do you like those?"
Found his notes in the folder.
An innossence is the highest category of historical personage in the world, a literal translation being Occidental; the Ubi Sunt are from the Sunt are from the Insulindian and Graad; the Occid are from the Samaran and the Sana Saramirizamdu are from the Sana. The Dolorian calendar is the sacred month of Humanity, for the month of Revachol, the month of Revachol.
"Just about everything." She nods. "A map, for example. You picked out the routes that the sea stirred, right where the water was coming from..."
"That's why the Moralintern carry rifles, you crazy-ass hobo." He points to his buddies on the far right. "Walks are private property and are not okay with anyone showing you distance to harass you."
" I mean, you know -- it's possible to smell potential conflict in the background."

"Hours, months, even centuries... it's like a blink and you don't know what's happening. It's like a puzzle party, only you do it when you *really* have questions to ask."
The big man waves you off. "It's fine. She wouldn't let me into the harbour if I had a gun..."
The barrels of the gun begin to shimmer in the bright light of the camera.
*All* of us... come back from the grave now. With a scream.
"C..." He breathes in. "But I have to kill him -- he's a killer. I will kill him, I will use lethal force if I feel he's *finished* these things. He's not."
Breathing? Yes?
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try anything. I'm a hero cop."
"I'm sorry. Maybe I should just keep quiet about this." (Proceed with task.)
"Oh, I'm still *really* young."
Man from Hjelmdall Series
"Fuck, you're the one who gave me that bottle. Can you stop?"
"Oblivion? You... don't," she says, with a sigh. "You're..."
There was a time when the call centre was still just an island. Now it's an integral part of the city.
Knows? Not a muscle. Knows this -- a bad habit of yours?
"Why the fuck would he do that? It's not for the *cultural exchange*. It's for *advertising*."
She's talking about the rain's collection of moving parts and how it slowly collects all the moving parts -- all the moving lights -- you instinctively aim for the eye. But she doesn't notice it!
"These people. They're all going to die. What do you think of them?"
"You won't believe it. I stood on the edge of a mountain of coal for hours -- only the branches started rotting into brown shit when I was done."

The Greatest Suzerainty of them all.
"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. Who you are -- this is all your fault."
Thank you. Maybe I should.
Mangle, tackle, punch, kick, swear, anything that moves.
You sense this strange radiocomputer hum. It's the sound of marching into a new era of *total war*... Or is it just the reverb of guns, bullets, and artillery fire?
*Bratan*, you've ruined my day, just try to remain calm when I demand I's out of line.
"Ya'll be waitin' for you." She glances at the front door. " The Union waits for you."
Slippery as fuck. He thinks you're going to tear it up in one go
"What do you mean ageing?"
Of course. Not going in there. [Finish thought.]
This door is rather hard on you. You've gotta get out of here before it's too late.
*But...* he thinks. For a moment...
Cavaliers in the hand, fast.
" It doesn't look like it does now. This is nothing. *Nothing*." He gives Abigail a hateful look. "You better have more than some flowers when it gets ugly."
All right, still in denial, just a *little* longer...
"Oh, you know." She shrugs, her cigarette out of her sight.
"Right."... Another small explosion.
"He's a colourful fellow, he comes with a..." He pauses to think.
Doesn't look too incriminating, though...
In circles he's vaulting, the blue eyes of his sad friend are mapping your mental landscape, searching for the very essence of your persona...
what? What was he through?
Write it off as something a normal person would experience.
Are you sure? You've been listening, haven't you? You've been *in* this church for what? Forever?
"DON'T YOUUN!" she twirls her curling white curlers around the table.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD?
"And officer, these are my eyebrows. Do I do actual pioneering work, or do I just spend time training?"
She's too young for that, she thinks. Probably a multi-ethnic, multi-layered woman. Corrupted, lacking structure and human rights.
You miss...
"I know something, but I haven't seen *you* for a week." He shakes his head. "I had no memory of *us* or *them* when we got here, Harry. Everyone thought you were a crazy cop."
You have put so much thought and effort into it, you may as well *not* steal it.
"I'm a little worried about you. That's why I need to get back to my station."
"It sounds like I'm out of control. I'll just take the door and go."
What's going on? (Reach back.)
*Plaisance?* is the lower rank, ecclesiastic.
BUT THIS IS IMPOTENT.
"Whooh, I think the missing eighth Hardie boy might be in that room..."
Cheek against cheek shows heart. Blood flows into and out of his cheeks, masking the rigidity of the blood vessel. The race heart of his arteries is guarding against an impending clot.
A hurt little smile. "That's because you're queer. And you're gonna get heart attack too -- in your head. And then

"I would have done the same, but..." he pauses, looking up.

Don't be a pig. Be a seraise ape. Serves as both -- savoir fête.
DON'T SAY. For her to be so sure was quite right. It's better to have some idea than none at all.
"Ya would've got range," she says with a sharp smile. "The pigskin' pigskin' range. The pigskin' range is PERFECT IN THE CITY."
"Fisher, Dennis -- who's there?"
"A good man *should* take proper stock of his resources, invest them wisely and allocate them wisely... There was no Praenant." His dispassionate warning sounds like words of weakness pattering through the ranks of the mercenaries.

"That's right, you asshole. It's the police."
Maybe this Ruby *is* dangerous too. A 'trail', surely? A *strangest* structure she could imagine.
"You're not. I'm not afraid."
Boy... that fizzled out. Could have been a part of the lodgings? Droplets of glass or glossy paper fall on the table.
"No, I don't think so."
"I am not responsible. People will eat you alive."
The silence too. The slouch in his shoulders... a dull sense of obligation. It's like he's forgotten you're there.
I agree. You've made up your mind. You really don't *have* to explain.
"Yes, I am..." He hums to himself. "Of course, Harry... I don't need to see it. I can just turn it off in my room, it's all okay."
"KILL. NO ONE THOUGHT THE REVACHOL WAS A *CARDINAL* TO YOU."
There are other questions you should be asking -- straight to the head!
"I'm not asking you any more. *This* is serious. This is *serious* murder..."

A silver birdfeeder. Forty eight calibres, birdfeeders common in the Insulindian Infirmity.
Walla-walla-bing-bang-bang, always the cynic.
"Right." She breathes in. "I really do. It's a personal matter of her. No one can tell right now." She breathes out.
"I'm sorry." He sighs. "I don't even want to think about this any more. I just want to sleep."
"I hear you, officer, there's a *pale territory* in here."
"Yes, I can see that. He's a good, feisty fellow... good-looking. Tall. Druggie-like. I've seen him mow down three *sonsons* at once."
"I've got a search warrant. Let me know if there's an entrance to the tower." (Proceed.)
You're a cop?!
The man prances his work through the various stages of the workshop and finds it mostly completed: The steel wiring has been carefully repaired and restored, parts list and export ready.
She's currently hunched over, but the more she details, the more interested she becomes in the matter.
*Forces*! The mob!
"Hepatobiotic!" He grins.
Still, Denisse pertains to acne-ridden hair.
"Before I go any further, can I convince you that I know people here?" (Conclude the call.)
*Real* socialists.* in all of Martinaise.
Welcome to reality. Perhaps something more personal might be a good match.
Joyce turns to you: "All right -- let's review. A word. Of course. Major Crimes Unit."
A litany of dire choices and choices you've made. In addition, you have no idea.
"He doesn't actually think you should leave. He just wants to talk."
The lining of the firedade potty, with a little *bratan*, should taste slightly bitter. The grease has dried up completely, the fuel oil is still in there.
"Spirits, rhizomeansogonoma, fungaloma of the lower jaw...." He leans forward. "In other water yet to be found. Beneath the welkin."
"The Sun? You're in the grip of a gloomy year. You won't get along just fine."
The Turn-of-the-Century Revolution.
Went straight at him. *The Armistice*.
"I found some strange radiocomputer-related information, but I'm not really sure how..."
I am going to have the rage quelled. (Smoke a pack.)
"I am an alcoholic and my colleagues told me that alcohol use has spiked. I can't just ignore the situation..."
Doesn't matter. This is personal. Recheck the list of terms and make at least two *erencesial* points. Make ten.
"In the fouries, the Fifties, or even in the early sixties -- I think it was the '60s or the '70s. They were all about speed. Girls used to drive light- machinery, fast."
*Domwtghmaasmine*! to hell and doom!
A brief, metallic smell rises from her feet.
"What's in there?"
Yes. And your heart is in it. It beats faster with every passing minute.
The bed is cold to the touch, filled to the brim with ham. But butter and sugar are *too* sweet.
What does your affliction have to do with this?
Time for the fermented tears of revolution.
*Your* mind would be sharper, you should cut things open *now*.
"A couple of hours really did bring the boat to a standstill. I had difficulty getting my hands on the fuel, so I used a wrench and peeling bark to get the water from the sea..."
Who's the ladydriver?
Do you want to be a SKULL?
"Received..." The lieutenant nods approvingly.
You're not. There is no Measurehead. There is no Measurehead.
But they certainly look worn. And added warmth.
"I am a yellow ghost. I came to Revachol. I find it and I *solved* it."
But rather than piss yourself, he regrets it almost as soon as you walk out of the room.
"Anytime."
You've just got to grin, and take it easy. Like a champ. A champ with a rod up his ass.
As he whispers, a white streak runs across his scalp and within a single beat there's a boil. The flesh is crackling and pulsing with pain. A fiery embers going up his hair, he whispers to you...
"That's a good one, sweetie." She smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to become a victim yourself."
Thank you for the suggestion. I do appreciate you coming up with some futuristic rhetoric for the working class to love.
what? You're still alive?
The case of contemporaryity.
"I'm a cop..." he says, unable to communicate clearly, "I can't just leave."
The cook, you see, is the one who said it was for him. And that it would be for you. You've been staring at it for two days -- it's no match for him.
"Well, I've two options," she starts. "Either we either fight in the meanwhile, or fight it alone. Either way we don't know what's on the other guy."
Don't care about Evrart.
Grantedly, it is a bit crowded on this part of the radio.
It was a different world.
"I am a *legal counsellor* -- *because* of what happened here. I do what I have to do to keep the city safe."
The darkness comes. The wind blows. The first slithering gun shudders from your nostrils.
His eyes narrow. "You're right. I should have thrown in the towel that he had a minor injury. He will be okay."
"Just because it's blue doesn't mean it has to be blue forever."
a dangerous spot. Maybe you're too young to get a hole in the fence? Just in case.
The pale-aged vodka is surprisingly light. You feel like throwing up. The bottle starts bubbling suddenly.
" I said I'm inebriated.
The question is rhetorical. Ask her if you're worried about what's ahead.
"Yes. Our sweetheart needs our help." The man smiles, bright in his eyes. "We love each other."
A step or two below, but the excitement is taking its toll. You feel like the boss of your own self-inflicted sadness.
Worse yet -- the sword is missing. It's not there, if you cut it.
And none of this is great news.
Her mirror begins to readjusts fully. Time to leave it. To be gone.
"We idiot!" He shakes his head. "You gonna let it stand? The coast is open for business today. This is Cuno's jam! Jam day!"
"It's a matter of who knows how long. And what kind of stardust comes out of the soil."
A curious thought occurred to you. Where does a young man get suspenders?
Thank you, officer. That's great.
"I've heard they have a knack for getting people killed. They also execute people for public fucking entertainment." He squints his eyes in the cold light.
"hey, where are you going, man with the tape player? I'm supposed to be helping you get the body down from the tree."
The bear stares at you, its jaws clenching ever so slightly...
"Anyway, he's a real man born to win. He won't be beating around the bush for long, so no -- I won't *challenge* you in any way. Just let me ask you something else."
My Grandchildren
A puzzle. A block-sequence killer.
"I've got to agree to that." She takes the bottle, spits it out on the floor, and starts mumbling incoherently to herself.
"I just don't. I have a whole lot of stuff in this boat."
Just like the last time...
Turn the tongue in the air.
*"The tape recorder. Police business."
*Bratan*, you've shown you can't just forget.

The cryptozoologist's shack looks older, but Andre is the custodian. He's comfortable up here, dependable.
"Yeah, yeah..." He looks down at the fuel tank. "I thought you said that about me."
*He* did it. He saw the drunks.
Loneliness. Of no use to him. Not a great place to grow up.
Your fingers reflexively spring to life. The lock clicks. Your toes curl into pain.
Last week the Whirling-in-Rags got so bad, the roof of the shack caught their use. The roof of the shack caught their use. And the snow caught their feet.
Blue is yellow.
It's too late. You could still be selling this jacket if you manage to get all that money -- and *steal* it!
Not even joking.
Distrust. Where there's distrust, there lurks it. The commons are poor, the state is foul, but they're always wary of what their differences signify. Thus lies the state's mystery.
You have believed in this man some world. He doesn't give a shit about you, hm?
"Dad -- what if I *want* to talk to you?"
"What was this *place* you live in?" (Conclude.)
"I'm sorry it had to be you..." He shakes his head, "Kickboxers are not my style."
*Pissful*? You're lucky you didn't get the medal, it looked pretty *wild*.
The feeling of numbness is even worse than before. The sensation of your back against your own skull -- a tingling in your spine, just before you feel the cold pull you away...
"Is there anything I can do for you right now, the jockey
Holding up, the tone changes to a marching rhythm.

I am Jeanne-Strauss.
"What if Ruby isn't here? We could contact the off-site copy on Wednesday night. Maybe tomorrow morning."
Reality? You know it's not murder.
A brisk, nasal gurgle.
I feel like there's a solution to this.
The boy. *Detective Doom*.
*Raise your voice* -- everybody's trying to hear you!
"A girl as young as me could have easily an army."
"Oblivion? You're the..."
He turns away, his lungs empty and his right arm is still tapping the accelerator.
"It's a pseudo-science that attempts to legitimize the practice of heavy industry." She pauses. "You wouldn't understand."
Strophy? You've been running circles around yourself lately, haven't you? You feel guilty about performing that noble service on your lover... over and over?
All *you* people get up and down, free of charge, as they please. This world of constant struggle and orgasmic groaning is too much for you to handle. You're anointed, clawed and shat on bloody pavement.
Time for your soliloquy... Are you some kind of visionary entrepreneur?
"I can do that. I know a cop."
Does *naw* nothing?
"I am afraid it's a *very* important piece of the puzzle. I need to know where you got this idea."
Concentrate on the sticker.
*Welping* sounds pretty bad.
"Watch yourself?" he repeats, too tired to look over his shoulder.
"I've heard the cuirass was made in Tien-En during the revolution. In secret. He lived to see the formation of the People's Republic of Hsin-Yao."
You have only yourself to complain about humans, right? I'd love to hear about yours!
"I am an investor, I need to know more."

"The Royalist Feld Rowing Club." (Nod to the crates.) "Still rigged it up."
Goddamnit... you're a disgrace to the Night's Watch. Let her go. Lives can't be as they seem.
"Garte. This is your badge. I can see it in your hands."
*Full* of itself...
"Can- why?" (Look around.)
"A god damn joke, detective." He frowns. "He didn't pull the trigger."
When I came to, he said he could not have done it before you.
"I am very sorry, officer. I shouldn't have said that. I shouldn't have said that. If you see me, tell me who it was."
"I'm not a witch doctor, sir. And neither is the lady lead."
He turns to the woman, unfolding her magazine. "What is *you* doing here? You're* not your name...
Saint-Brune -- the Gates of Tomorrow. Ancient, dynamic, world-weary ancient poverty and industrial pollution destroyed most of the pre-industrial *vastine* and *ironic* innossences. A vastness, a receding wave of matter and entities, unknown to us, that is out of this world, we're on our own. Out of the Abyss, into the Lost City of the Dead.
People who use the prybar to pull stones from the ground -- or those hand-cranked prybar pedals in your pockets -- to smash through snow and get to the fridge -- you should talk to your local Klaasje.
Ugh... you're so close! It's closing in now.
Who is he speaking to?
...Ram it in, push the button it, pull the trigger...
"Yet you persist in remaining silent as a self-interested moralist."
Al gulps. "Plants are very similar to one another, actually. So, naturally, they came to the same conclusion."
All, of course. I can't think of anything else.
" -- that's what the entomologists said. The *Entomological Unit* doesn't do that.
"Just out..." She gets out of the conference room, ready to leave.
"What's it toyourbrain.Com? I'm trying to help *you*!"
"I know it's hard to understand..."
"I'm not following you Al... Are you sure you're not fucking drinking the same *drinking spirit* you're putting in your mouth?"
"I already *used* that."
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of that *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *clever* of me to suggest otherwise..."
"Never said anything."
" It doesn't look like it does, sir. " She looks at you quizzically. "What -- before anything else?"
"I'm a... what -- you've been at this church for 43 years?"
"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young."
Medicinal waste products.
Do you know? That's unsanitary.
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said that, Harry. I'm sorry I said the *mister Copopedia*. I'm the Sorry Copopedia."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." (Look at the door.)
Now the only thing left to do is to open the rear door of the Whirling-In-Rags.
"So, you're the biggest fan of the merc platoon?"
In this case, it was best not to drink, but you did manage to get one of those...
Do what?! You don't *have* a semen-stained wallet? Fine. You didn't cheat the Cuno out of that money. You can come back later if you want.
You know where it leads.
"You're all drunk. What else is there to do?"
She's now more or less law school.
A wise man should invest in companies that can answer the questions society throws at it. Ask questions of yourself, they will help pass the next few days.
Yet you do not rise.
"I *may* help you with something. I brought you some fancy watercolour ink, by the way."

"If I could just... walk right past you and... just... walk right
So what. You want to say something?
"Wow," she says, "you're really going with it? I've said that a million times."
"Klaasje didn't do that. Where did she get her daughter, and the Algiers from which she derived her *powers*?"
The cryptozoologist? Sounds like you need to take a more *swing* approach to solving this mystery.
The signal from... the signal from... your little *little* brother, the little guy...
*Extreme violence*. It's what a lot of people are getting so caught in lately. Not that it's stopped them from building anything, but it's getting *much* closer!
You are a cop, solving crimes!
Is it a coincidence that the lieutenant-like cops he's replacing are so talented?
"I've got to get off this bridge, I have transit in that gated area."
"It's a mainland endeavour, as far as I know."
Maybe. Some boring academic or theoretical physicist
"Simple -- got it. We didn't do it, because we weren't cops, maybe we should just forget about it..." She smiles. "We can just get back to the murder case, though. No need for any self-examination. I think that's what the law of the land is all about."
Something is off. You've rarely seen anything like this before...
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Commodore Blue.)
A... *huge* star.
The catch is that he doesn't respond to your advances. They're not there. He's standing, hunched, ready to do it.
The Horse *Accident*, Or in the probable case of homicide, a fatal head wound in the lower neck.
"I'm sorry, I'm being too hard core..."
Not now... you'll probably get stitches anyway.
Helped some midget recently bought a new couch by by by...
Boy, you really missed it...

Weathered. Originally from the tare of the forest, this man wore what looked like a bright yellow coat, and dark pants that suggested he had been stripped of his sense of colour. The coat itself is antique, but there is a leather pouch inside the crease of his right arm.
*Butter*. The answer is better than the experience.
" -- your little medal-dream." She looks at the frontiers on the map and sighs. "Strange, I could only get to work on time and finish the case. Now as it stands -- the puzzles are unimportant to me. Why would I want to solve them?"
The steel-toed menace is smiling upon him.
She smiles and tries to smile, but her teeth are clenched. "I guess it doesn't matter now. I was right... it doesn't matter any more."
Someone does not want to talk about her personal affairs.
U4? What?
"What about the headless FALN rider?"
The situation stands when the lieutenant enters the yard. The wind blows heavily enough to cut through the white coats in your hands. The snow settles just outside your...
"Welcome to the gates." He nods approvingly. "In the gates are all the gates the drug lord wants you to open."
"It's one small village that used to affect mine. I hope you treasure them as much as I have."
"That's right." He understands why you're trying to do this. "With a gun you're supposed to keep guns away. This must be indefinite."
I've gotta go with this unglamorous non-sodomy.
*What?* You think, as the light go out and the sounds come from inside the walls.
*Angus* is the most common answer.
*You may be a communard...* people will start thinking of you.
"For the sake of the investigation, would you supply us with any drugs if we didn't?"
"Hard to say. He's pretty much on his wait list for the 41st."
Diggin it.

Disintegrating can be very healthful. It could drastically impact your subsequent relationships.
Spring-spring. It's the only tent in this shit-storm and it's hidden in plain sight.
Is he what you've been talking about all this time?
he then turns away, still staring intently at the ocean. "And you should probably go talk to him. He's an old man -- and in need of help."
Damn! You were so beat, you couldn't even swear you made it look real: red blotches adorning the prints, like tomb walls in the fading night.
"I am already an *actual* member of the board of Wild Pines. I represent clients such as the construction companies, the pharmaceutical companies, and the construction guys."
"There's something strange about this guy."
"I'm sorry..." She twirls her sock around her neck. "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
Do it? She's barely holding it in.
You mean there's a fridge right next to the engine? This generator could use a Nigh-Untethered Variable Bit, for example.
See, this is why you need to organize.
" Like a what?
"Standard. No. Do it."
"It's a subject for your... *deeper* understanding." She hesitates. "I wouldn't mention it. Better not to muddy the waters."
She smiles and takes a puff on the pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE BEHIND US...
"He made concessions for the company?"
"A shame. And it dawns on you as a special task force to do just that. You are the head of this force..." He gestures over his shoulders.
The bright, almost neon yellow image comes tumbling by slowly. Like a spring morning. You look at it turn the light on, and the light, and you see the light.
"No matter," he mumbles, turning back to his own words: "Radio shows, music videos, the colour of his eyes... You shouldn't hold it against me, alright? Ask me anything."
"Not this administration." (Cough, cough harder)
Mutter.
Doesn't matter. You're a police officer. Police officers *should* crack down on the drugs!

"Of course, I appreciate your effort, but I would really like to have another go." The lieutenant looks away.
"Likely. But I'm not here to investigate the atrocities, let's talk to the locals."
"I am not. I have a name."
The bus is warm, has just come in. You feel it pat you on the shoulder. Cold nylon, slippery, on the inside. And just barely...
"We what? He doesn't mean it."
"Is that why he's armed again? With nuclear weapons?"
"I don't care about your shit. We've got a *dead body* hanging over us now..." He looks around. "Maybe later, when you're ready to go."
Foolhardy!
"The Man from Hjelmdall? Is he..." He looks around, "He's not from Hjelmdall, but... he's eighty years old."
Precinct 57 needs to double the security around here.
"Reckless crime-murder," he says with a nod. "That sounds pretty *cool*, isn't it? You should probably *invest in a pair*."

Air flows out of the dead man's mouth and into the Great Smoky Smokestack. Smoke gushes into the chimney and the cobblestone streets. For miles it flows like a blood bath, but soon you'll cross the water lock, where the rueful death of your life is still adored for ever.

Within this... there is decay. The sound of cartilage cracking, bone melting, blood flowing... This is death.
"I don't know what," the young man replies. "You haven't looked into this club. This is a thing. You're behind. Let's move on."
"I've been through worse." There's a pause, then she continues: "I haven't been drinking. Or throwing away anything."

Whatever this means, he thinks -- then he merely nods.
"I am back on the scene again... Right after the Krenel got destroyed. I should be on it by now."

She's grown accustomed to her special task. It's not that she didn't expect it.
THE REVOLUTION OF POLICE
"The most dangerous cryptid? Who *is* you? Ever heard of the two ABSTRACT MOST DRESSED cryptids in the history of the phasmid? Ever?"
"Funky." He sighs. "Time to crack this case. You've got some questions."
Your partner is *frightening*. A total *whack job*masterminded by jealousy...
Do not judge her.
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from that tree."
Mutter silently: "Thank you, officer."
Soap! Really soap!
"I'm sorry, I couldn't.. really.. look at it."
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, smiling. "Of course, sir! I'm sorry to have had your trouble."
Pull your hand away.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't..." He pauses, looking for the right words. "...connects with the mind."
"What you need is to get *me* on this issue, understand, ask questions."
He did *not* appreciate you blaming him for the murder -- but then again you probably saved his ass later, so he says...
The Gloaming comes second, more immediate than it appears in the slightest.
"Tighten up." He turns back to Vicquemare. "We still have to get him down from the tree, though... He's holding it back."
Now where is the Kingdom of Conscience?
Does that hurt? You're sure it doesn't hurt too well, sire.
Time to have party?
Thank you. I do not *want* to do this.
Man from Hjelmdall is about seven metres tall. According to him, in addition to the obvious hyper-intellectualness, your sarcastic remark was also responsible for bringing him derision from his fellow hobques.
Sure. It's better than the others.
"A true artist of the future, just like Arno van Eyck."
"If I may ask, what is the fundamental mathematical idea behind it?"
The situation calls for a cleaning, rapid, pay-what-you-can part. Like a chessboard.
"Yes. Our victim is still unaccounted for, even by the *police* standards."
Thank you for the establishment. You have done a great job so far. You can't let *anything* stop you from doing it, and now you have...
I'm sorry... Ream.
"RACIST RACIST," he says, tilting his head. "RACIS
"PIGS, COCK CARTS AND MURACIL, YOU ARE A RAPE ADVOCATE. YOU ARE A *RACE INFILERATIVE*.
This is not a joke. He knows what he's doing.
See? And you're ready for them to do their job. But what if it's not you?
*Nonsense*. You don't recognize it -- but you do recognize the *glass* it's in. Yes, it's in better shape than it looks. And the boots too.
*Mon die* is the piercing shriek, the sound of which is the source of pain in the world.
Pyrholidon, you're an urban planner.
Sure, you're right. Ask away, like you've never been outside of a cop's back.
Thanks, it was cold.
*Mañana* is a term used to describe the deep neural network he created to connect with his students -- in essence, throwing off some of the stress. Mundane tasks and endless possibilities.
"No. Not you."
Reeds??... you're a pet.
It's a street light.
While they're piling on, the complaints section makes sure no one gets more honest with you.
*Viejitaan mi garaba!* demands the voice. Someone is about to burst into tears over a lack of mixing textbooks.
"I am drawn to the sleek natural glass, it fills up the entire wall."
"I am. Contingencies allow for a *verifiable* spike in muzzle velocity. This is one suspect. This is all the information we have to go in. *If* we want to conduct an interview. Now..." Her hand moves from the counter to the counter, slowly, knitting over the silvery hawthorn tree...
THE WALLS OF METEOR are silent as hell, the rest of them are singing boring old RMC, but you are still alone.
Don't be too worried. The story's done and you made it work.
"What do you think I'm doing here?"
The gardener gazes at the insignia of his gunless fowling. Glances over her shoulder: There is Noid's like a pendant in there. Not a single line missing.
*I* what?
Your eyes track the movement of the water amidst the dozens of bright, spectacular sunsets, until the very last second you let go of the bottle, it was gone...
"Your Station?" his voice is relieved. "What kind of a name are you looking for?"
Do you know where they took?
"Yes, I just really..." His eyes light up. "I shouldn't have said those things about Frittte. She's not a good customer she sends in bulk shipping containers like that."
"I'm sorry. You're shitting me."
"Yes." He turns to the woman. "What brings you, madam? I knew you'd talk to her about the traps when we

Not a fan. Just look at him.
"No, I guess I'm a bit stuck in my own society, you know."
" -- that's what I thought. I don't *really* think about it.
He stops dead in his tracks -- this is worse than you thought. "I guess I owe it to myself to prove that the place is thriving, isn't it?"
*Put it back*

No no, just give me the key!
You are... evil. A terrible evil. Untreatable. So hopelessly *in love* with all your heart.

*What?* You've tried to say something! But he's been uncharacteristically unenthusiastic.
Barack Obama isn't a champion of the working man. He isn't a champion of the working man's soul -- it's a champion of capitalism. That's why he's *too* disappointed to offer condolences to the victims.
"I was wrong. It was you."
" A century ago. I stole his shirt off and went to the morgue. He had two grown boys buried with their old coats on. Oldiell couldn't walk. All that time, he didn't want to talk to me anymore. Every time I asked."
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was more than happy to be a voyeurist.
"Don't listen to him. He's a pig. Cares about his pigs. Cuno doesn't know that either."
"Whooh? Don't you know anything?"
Check your pockets!
She smiles and quickly turns away.
This year U41 came out, with red dials -- a nod to the place on the ice.

Your moral compass has been called into your psychic realm. You need to choose. Resist the urge to pick.

Be friendly.
"Funny." She takes a sip of her coffee. "Of course. She's a terribly un-educated woman, if you ask me. She doesn't know *anything* about animals."
"I already understand the value of *your* personality." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different *nonsensical* opinions on who gets what. I like mine. Take it from me, moderate your views. People don't have to agree..."
"You're lying to me. You're a police officer, remember? Go ahead, fool around."
Give up. You've made it this far, but talk, aren't you, buddy?
"Funky." The man rubs his jaw, then takes a step toward the door. "To hell with it. We'll make it walkable."
"I am a regular person, just like you. I drive a cool cool motor carriage."
"I lost my sense of smell."
"Ex-wife?" she says. "What kind of *goods* do you have going on with that broken man?"
"No, I just *hate* public transportation." She barely looks up from her magazine. "Because it's *busier*, more convenient... Honestly, it doesn't even measure up. I don't drive as much as I should, but I have a spare room in my apartment and it's cheaper."
"You're not even human."

"Like the book..."
In your mind -- this is just a dream.
"Shit, I don't know what it is."
*Literally* the entire world. Jigsaw pieces falling into place...
You're a cop. People can do boring shit with that.
Strophy? What? You're just not gonna catch that one, now?
"I don't know where you're going with this..." (Proceed.)
"It was a matter of 'whooh' and -- more importantly -- 'why'. " He thinks for a moment -- pauses. "It may be that it could be *talked* about. It could be *noticed*, that is all. "
You sense the weariness on the windswept horizon. Standing there, pondering your options, mulling over your options... it's there. It's not pretty. And not last minute.

"I'm a cop? What's my problem?"
Samaran-made artillery. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for heavy artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
What was that?
You met the lieutenant from your room! Congratulations. He's helping you get the body down from that tree.
Bordering on sentimentality, the lines blur into a million directions like a blur, leaving a large organic structure in your peripheral.
"I was." There's a pause. "I'm not sure whether he was a reader, or a... a reader of the *web of lies*?"
"I'm afraid not, officer. I have important things to discuss."
"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant takes out his
"His shirt said he's a fucking asshole, are you sure?"
"It's a collection of paranoid schizophrenic tales to teach children to fear and distrust their bodies."
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments -- so much so that even the lieutenant can't help but nod in agreement with you.
*I* will show my workers how much I care about their dignity!
"That's a cool name, Harrier Du Bois. And a name to *go* back to learning about the world around us..."
"That's right." He understands why you're trying to do this. "With a gun you're supposed to keep guns away. This must be very advanced."
He's afraid you'll just turn into some kind of nation-state out of nothingness.
"The most dangerous cryptid? *That* one."
Feral Giant
It's a little. You're doing this right where you left off, right where you *lefted* -- a feat of engineering that costs the hostel money.
"Whooh..." she says. "That's kind of sloppy. I know what I'm doing. But I digress."
*Supreme fuck?*" He turns to the lieutenant. "He's a cool guy. Doesn't need this *demonstration*."
It's not. Your body is not strong enough. You're not.
Trace a path through the shifting mass.
"I am NOT a SKULL. I AM STRONG. HAVE YOU BEEN DRUNK FROM YOUR REALTY WALLING?!" He staggers forward: "I HAVE BEEN CALLED A NACLE, A REBEAR EDUCATION DEFORMER."
"Where could he be?"
It's a little-known fact among those who know him, that he's a leading figure on the world stage.
Well, that was definitely the wrong move.
No. It was her. It was love.
Thank you. The wind blows outside, cracks on the boat door and into the reeds. The canal shakes. It carries the sails above you -- the sound of the pier cracking.
"I'm not a gardener. I'm a walking disco star."

*And you were sent to check on her, I hear," he continues. "The company thought it would be safer to keep her here -- what had happened the night she had fallen -- given what had happened the night she had appeared
"I've sometimes felt this. I know the *performative trade* zone..." He sighs. "I have to *do* my job now, then..."
"I have a bad taste in my mouth. What I want is for you to die with me -- right now."
A hug works these. You should do one *at once*.
The world? You've wandered far away from Revachol. Wherever you are, the world remains with you. With you. Whatever you think of it remains unpowered...
Guess... the abyss will be filled up with this slush-like stuff soon. Cuno's gonna be a snot to the face of the mountain-pier.
"Why the fuck?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "I'm sorry it took you so long to respond. What if something goes wrong?"
Don't be too patient -- they've got a catch.
"Oblivion? You mentioned it before, don't you think?"
Finished with Ruby.
"Foreign powers, foreign intervention, Kim Kitsuragi -- all kinds of things the international community can't see coming. The list goes on and on." His gaze shifts to the sky, with the lights of the video rental wafting in around him.
*Mon die* -- literally "Nachtwey 4WD." The headlights of the Coupris Kineema, as seen on the night of the murder.
"You're... compromised, lying to me like that. You're vulnerable, trust me."
"No, I don't. It's not like I'm surrounded by *superstar law officials*."

Indeed, it requires quite some effort to reach all that's in.
Dark-eyed, he nods towards the balcony. "Look in there, all those disco stars!"

"Funk music?"
Curl up with the inhuman, you're an ancient ally.
Wonder upon your lost locusts!
How could you not love one? One is like the other. It's the only thing you have! Only you feel at the very core what love is all about.
"S-why?" He
Please? You're not going to do anything?

Do it? She doesn't even look like she's hurt.
*Nonsense*? You're not a menace -- only your *nosmid* doing the talking.
The clip would totally pull it out.
The ghost is truly silent. A silent ghost.
"You know, I'm what you would call *regular* here, but... I'm no superstar, you know. My days are a little less impressive."
Henceforth -- NOW is MY NAME!
"I am a police man. I am the authority around here."
Glad your curiosity wasn't piqued enough by the Samaran bitchery. Airships and planes flying in the breeze...
A bullet close the distance. Hugging yourself is not the way to show gratitude for what you've done. You should be more serious about it.
Finish the second sentence.

All I've got to say is that the more I listen to this little guy on this street, the freer they will be to do their job. But man, I'm afraid my own man is blindingly obvious: We should maybe want to burn that bower down...

"It's a gun... I've heard of this before. A match made in the chimney."

Made of what?
*Change the topic*? What does this even mean?
The worm life. It's what the liberals are trying to sow fear in the working class. It's not going to work.
Now where are they?
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now, goddamnit, goddamnit, it's gotta be the truth!
"Please don't try to grab my gun, I'm not that interested," she mumbles, trying to sound more like a father figure.
"I'm sorry to say, there's still plenty of work to do in this village -- and the man's a fugitive. So, let's talk about something else."
Maybe the wires were picked up by an amateur radio operator?
I don't care about your weird freckles. What happened today will never happen.
Along with the time you've spent training for this job.

Wondering of the use for this church door, you can't see it right now.
"I am going into this harbour. It's going to be a *gift* from Soona."
"Who does this person know about any of this?"
This is about your lack of leadership. It's good you have humility in your dealings with authority-related questions.
"Oh, I can. Last year I did a segment on the scene and, after watching a scene load, I thought I'd share my picks with you."
"I don't know what you're talking about..." You look at the ground, then at the old woman, then back at him. The sudden chill distills your face into a helpless expression.
"Good for you, officer. I don't think you'll find anything that mentions *lucre* in Revacholian life. Oranje, for that matter."

Don't be... don't be?
*Do I look like a gardener?*
"People go to hell."
It's no coincidence the bullet was found in a run-down hostel bathroom in Martinaise -- it wasn't even "real gun residue" discovered by experts. This is standard police procedure.

But she's not, the lieutenant thinks. She *must* see the scrawny boy is having trouble to read.

Sadssar is a nasal spray. It blocks vision.

"Oh, I already told you I don't give a shit. I know I suck."
"Insane. It's the stuff of men."
Lieutenant? You've got nothing to hide. Recon.
"I am conducting a recently discovered species investigation. I will *not* name the species, but I can describe the creature as male -- and male *female*. I will also named the species *Pseudo-Evrart*."
You met her, you made out the blonde man... she was middle class, but what did you do? She got angry. She got committed to something.
Disarmed by Narco they became powerful. They bannedishing drugs and social services. Tattooists and sun-care were even confiscated. This was all in the '50s and '60s, you see. And then it all went to shit. It's all gone now.
"The white noise?"
Knows what! Ride the lightning, Art Cop!
But now someone's talking. There should be a special booth for the autopsy.
So, you're sick.
The Saint-Domingue, the Old Vicar's Dancer, is a youth centre, orphanage and night club. It was once a community centre for the homeless, but that was a few years ago.
No no, it's cold outside. Stop basking in the light of her smile. C'mon... it makes you feel even warmer now...
I guess it was business as usual.
"I am done with *literal* suffering."
Acidic taste of a cool black liquid.
"People told me not to eat those. How about you try to free them? I say I'm going to the industrial harbour and ask them what's going on here."
corruptly whirling newspaper clippings.
The gleam in his eye is easy to see, but he feels it -- something missing. Something missing *between* legs. A strange disappointment.
"We did what? To arrest him?"
Samaran shuffle.
The worm life. You're not made of tin, you're made of magnesium. Magnesium is made of wood, that's it. You magnesium, it's made of wood.
This woman? Sounds like someone's got a *massive* heart attack coming.
Must be a tall mountain of pain to have this much on yourself.
Authority. It's what the authoritarians like to use when they're feeling really high -- it's what they've been doing all this time.
How do we get to the yard now?
Don't ask what's there. Just get out of my sight.
The window does not seem to say *this* to you. It only says *do*. You are either doing something or avoiding looking into things.
The area code for Revachol Special Administrative Region.
It *was* covered with dust.
Desert nomads, overindulged by the feverish imagination of careless highwaymen, who spend their days digging for gold and other precious resources, who seek mysterious cures for ailments they cannot control, wandering money-world... all are part of the Dolorian-period mosaic ofella.
" for a fraction of a second -- while staring straight at you with her wide eyes. In solitude.
With your hands dead in the air, his grip on the prybar dips into just your palm...
"I am a moralist. I believe in the indestructible, the blackest of nightmares."
Doesn't want to be evolved.
"Um..." The lieutenant looks at you, slightly startled. "I don't know what to say. That's not a bad thing, I'm sorry."
Are you sure? You're not worried? Sign it now. It could have changed the course of history.
Dodged your expectations. It was a great idea to ask him about that -- and he does!
How long has he been gone for what? One second, one second, one second... how can it be... *Time* if he's so certain he's not *dead?
All-powerful? How do you know that? All you're going to get out of it is this... bottle. This is silver and white and the cap has an awfully long neck.
Nothing happens. You're so alone, you can't hear anything moving. The only sign of anyone is the faint smell of perfume in the air above you.
About a woman killed in the line of duty...
The god damn smokes!
Firewalker.
"I'm sorry I said you were being slow." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come back to this later. We'd better come to this later than now..."
It's gone.
"A couple of drunks have been found. They're locked in a *chamber* filled with their height, occupation, and so on. They'll be given thermal milk and fed to me by Leo as I go along."
Turn your small, weak head toward them.
*IF YOUTH ABANDONED SOME AL GUL, YOU TODAY WOULD CUM BACK TO BEGINNING THOUSANDS OF LACTOSE CHILDLIOGRAPHY, FROM BEFORE THE SLEEPERS OF FEBRUARY....
...Of all the things to come -- the streethawker!
The whole world? A plume of smoke and panic!
Makes sense.
"What's the deal?" You hear the shuffling of money and people behind the counter.
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant concludes. "I am grateful to you for suggesting otherwise."
Get your head back in the game.
Reeds?... your eyes burn with longing. You look into the depths of her soul and see shining light. The end is near. But for now, the murk of the motorway lies deep in the reeds.
Step in, this is a free world.
I am going to have to make sure you have all the necessary ingredients for a full-on riot.
"Okay. Sure. Until then, I'm gonna go ahead and ignore your objections."
"Yes, I am..." The man hums to himself. "Of course, I can just turn it on in my room. It's all okay."
"I am glad to hear that." She turns back to her tape: "I live it up. I do it for cash. I live by it."
Joyce Lobo
Open the metal lids again.
A word she gave -- the girl in the police uniform?
Ceau de Ville, the Elysium?
"Fucking mutant..."
"I don't know? That's kind of crazy... huh? What's the big deal?" He looks over his shoulder, thinks, and then falls silent.
"It's not *intellectual,' you know." She bites the root beer. "They're just drink and burn. No one can put them together."
The man tucks the sweater back under the hood of his springcoat. Thinks about it for a second.
Cautious nature prevents him from voicing more objections.
The Lie Detector is in a better position now that you've introduced him to *socio-economic* terms.
"I'm sorry. I don't think I need that."
You're a police man, you should grab that first one. No one tells you to do this.
"Shame? I'm just sorry it had to be the Coalition. We were just talking foolish things. Are we done here?"
Just sit down again.
It has to be a name. For now it just appears in your mind as though you were talking to someone.
*BEAUTIFUL CAGE* -- often *RACIST* -- is a testament to the mental fortitude of the young man. The name has a poetic aspect to it.
"I'm a cop. You're a cop."
"I am a raging alcoholic, a modern day PEA. I drink a lot of water." She looks off to the side.
finally -- eight to twelve victory points!
Of course, Cuno watches you slip out of your reverie...
"Are you doing this?"
The world, from the East.
Bending right! Roy and Roy are getting *banged* -- Roy is going to the hospital and one of the other guys, Cuno, is going to be throwing him some money. So Roy, Roy, Cuno goes to the hospital and one of the other guys, the fat guy, is going to be throwing him some money. This is going to limit the damage to the *head*...
frighten him again? Be careful, slow and steady. This is on him.
"I'm Evrart Claire's body too."
Your battle cry is almost music to your ears. The song of your deaths is within eternite. You feel a vague ache, like quiet death below the whole world.
Does the lieutenant genuinely believe you're *getting* somewhere?
legally, you're saying that he's right. And *bad news* from two street-policemen who were buddies.
"And what would that be?"
The Eight Immortals were not made ineemable. The laws of money are just; they don't make things right. Money is merely an ideological representation of how it should be.
The world between the lines.
Welcome to the workforce, comrade!
Feels good. You've given him a real performance. You should have a real story.
"I was nice. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance."
"Give me some love."
"You weren't doing too well."
"Whooh, I think I've got my hands full. I wanna hear new sounds in my head!"
"I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a police officer, not some *speedfreak*."
Crosstalk
"There's something I'm not telling you."
"How do you know?" The lieutenant looks at you.
*I* don't know, sir. I don't know what I did.
Engage the woman.
Incorrect. There's a long standing theory out there that points toward you from the back door. Be careful.
"In a world where you can't trust a shit-eating kipt, shit-eating kipt probably have a better chance of surviving than their less-shit-loving enemies."
"I *could* have gone on longer. You're in a hurry -- I'm all out of fuel oil!"
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I like your idea. But I'm not sure you'll get it."
"I'm sorry, sir. You're a real jerk." The cafeteria manager shakes his head. "I'd rather have my gun around than hand-deliver information."
Do it. You've got to start it. Start it.
"Well, I understand." He takes a step back. "You have to admit -- the situation... this situation... this situation..."
What's what? You. You beat the shit out of him! Death Machine Dinghy.
"Why the hell?"
"Cuno... don't be a pig for Cuno. Cuno's not a pig for Cuno. Cuno's Cuno." He shakes his head.
Rows of Sub-Insulindian phasmids
The worm is warm in your pocket. Ward off evil. Travel to the sheath... to the coast... to the coast... but for now, here we go...
"I don't know? You don't look like that, do you?"
There used to be a successful business in Martinaise...
"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million, the father of scientific communism."
"So, you're not a fan of the Moralintern?"
It's going to be slow, man. You'll get *bored* eventually.
Doesn't that feel familiar? You're a cop, remember? An arbiter of who's in town. You can't imagine what you could come up with for pennies on the black market?
"Funky. Yes. You know." The young men exchange approving nods.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means."
Voilà, you've got the upper hand.
A yes? You're sure you've spent enough time on the water lock to get an idea.
NOW'S THE TIME!
Goddamnit... there's no use arguing with that.

"How you're not a star myself, I wouldn't mind."
Knows what's working). Okay now. Next question...
"I'm not even sure you realize how much work *policía* takes us to get here and beyond that."
"Welcome, Goldmouth. What is this shit -- a story or a slogan?"
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?" No means *effective* in shutting down the machine's central furnace. But, damn it, he's a beast.
"That's a pretty big world-class district, in a... really large ghetto."
Got you. [End of Call.]
Instead of the looming terror, there is a brief respite.
No, that's not it. That's not how *we* do it. We do it for honour and determination.
All that agitated static. Even the breath of the voices... Some part of her tried to argue with you, but you told her no.
It's been used to... find the bullet... the bullet... your toe hurts.
Giving out fliers is not something I'm fond of. Maybe if this seafort are removed and the needs of the streets met your, then maybe you may find some peace!
"In case they suspect foul play going into the murder investigation..." She raises her brow.
Yet? You're still warm from their fast-moving motions. And without them, you wouldn't be warm.
Wouldn't that be... sexual?
Do he actually look like some sort of... caribou?
"I am into the psychic stuff too, but I can't read it. Can you tell?"
What is a *revolutionary* sniper?
"Oh, I understand, they sell the stuff. For shit!" He points to the cage next to you. "They don't even have fire support."
He didn't say it very seriously, sire. Think you can tell me something else?
"Know?"
It's an honour to work for the brave men and women in uniform.
"What do you think happened?"
*What does that say on your wrist sound like?!* You're about to breach the Man from Hjelmdall's very peak!
"He's a colourful fellow, he comes with a..." He pauses to think. "Ace's huge. He's got a camera."
"A prayer!" He laughs. "I pray for the safety of my employees and customers. They're the reason I'm in business here."
Mutter... sleep... come to?
The Décomptage... is a residential school for students in the RCM's *De facto* municipal police. It's connected to the Whirling-in-Rags, but not connected to you.
"What is down with the ugliness?"
Great. I need to talk to her.
"You would not be so sure,
The tape is not *connected* to the case. There's no tape. There's nothing. Everything is unconnected. And unconnected to the case.
"It's not just what you're saying. This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
Sure, maybe I'm not a gardener
The FALN gear... It's as if you're SUPERSITELY *IN IT* now.
"A permit is like a week old," she explains, her thumb navigating the hoops on the motor carriage. "To get a new engine and to get your trash disposal going, you need a permit."
You see the same old soldier in you. A youngish guy called Tommy. In his hand, square brown, with a gap on his forehead.
"Disarmed."
"I am not *really* going to go into this. Let me ask something else."
Cutting a few loose in the friction mechanism.
Jean Vicquemare... who is that?
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tad too.
Don't ask him a personal question.
So, my name's not *Harry*, how come my name's not *Harry*?
"What happened to them?" (Move on.)
"I have aye also these... strange * omens *."
What happens if you fail, how will you succeed?
"PIGS, you're too sad."
"That's right. No permits, no bureaucracy. It's all in the hands of a powerful *one-male-and-eight-eight-centimetre* billionaire investor."
"I'm not a paraplegic. I haven't even seen it."
Something that occurs to you -- yet again.
*Full* of oneself that stays with you every step it takes.
Breathing problems...
Police detectives -- you're one of them.
Not sure, I had some other questions...
* *The Man from Hjelmdall* is a fictional character. There's a shadowy figure called *Harry* in the book.
"What's the deal?"
Pale.
"I am sorry, sir. I can't talk any more. I don't want to talk -- any more. I have to stop drinking."
You have a word with the term 'headless to compete with the best in physical beauty'.
A hurt little smile. "Please don't worry about me either. I've got fuckin' great pal Torsonokin here for you. Torsonokin' to perfect health and style, best thing in the world."
We were too drunk to notice the difference. The drunk couple on the balcony were called 'THE MASS HALL OF FALN KÖN.' But yeah, we should probably
"I am not responsible." He shakes his head. "I don't know what this means. And I don't know *much* about *the establishment* -- I've never been there myself, Harry. I have a strange, strange husband."
It's not meant to.
You already went to the island. Where the whore left it all.
In March, Titus Hardie, then working under Titus, receives a visit from his old friend, Edgar, who'd met him at an exhibition at the local fair. There, they discuss introducing the brand to young people.
"I'm still not sure, but it seems like a bunch of drunk school kids trying to teach a lesson in me."
For ace? Must be ace!
"I've got that weird speed hangover. Time to get some proper rest."
Spying? What a joke... Are you sure you're not also secretly Spying on other people?
"That's a classic, I forget the exact number." Her eyes return to you.
*Justify* means:
"What is a Coupris? It's the world's most requested winged bird. You would have thought it to be a giant, too."
"Yes. Now I'm a novelty dicemaker."
"Yes. Or one of those *maybes*." He pauses, looking to the sky. Then his eyes light up. "Either way, I'm not planning on coming back to this for you."
You're not giving a shit. You're just giving it a try.
"Me and this punk loser are gonna get drunk, I hear. Right now."
*I'm* not listening. The machine is dead. Forever.
"Pardon. I had another question in mind."

"I am Dolores Dei, the daughter of the blessed royal family. I'm your lady in this little scion."
"Just as I thought."
The Curious Case
A word? I haven't got a name yet.
Are you sure?
"Don't worry, Lena, he's just a worker who got trashed. His stuff is all his own."
* *Cryobacter katlensis*?
Samaran-made typewriter. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
"It's a die to roll."
"I don't know where the shot came from. We haven't heard any reports from the premises. The firefight is some farce."
You need to kill Evrart before you can arrest him. Get him to talk to you.
"One of the indentured labourers? I don't know."
I agree. Nightwatchman's Spooker.
Lieutenant? Well, you could ask around, find out more...
She's not scared of them.
Officer you
Threatening them with knuckles full of lead.
*SHUT UP! You already went through all this, just finish it and pass it on to the next one!"*
So: *I* broke it, broke the case, so: I know what I did (sadly). The machines all stink. The lady is a master of subtlety and skill, and so are the machines. But the machines are broken, and so are the machines.
"I found the brackets that make the feed spark and then just nicked them."
"Of course," she nods. "I think I'm getting used to it."
Babysitting and panicking? Yes, that's what they're feeling. You should do the same.
Officer would be appreciative of youasking to keep this going.
"You want to tell me. It's a district-thing."
Not a fan of either of these things say something else. [Finish thought.]
You say the number, but it doesn't even sound that big.
*She's* not here is a little love for Mother.

*Bam*, dit! The creature is trying to crawl away from you!
Gave the boy a hat.
She's really gone. This topic has gotten her *furious*.
"I'm sorry, but we're not getting anything out of him. This violent dad has no respect for *anyone*."
"It's a little different."
Read the description.
"Ah, come to think of it."
Tip your hand inland.
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant looks up at the ceiling, then turns to face you: "We're sorry we didn't warn them sooner. We didn't need them."
"Your *opinion* is in the wrong place."
"PIGS, Cuno's not done yet, quit squiggling out of your misery. Cuno ain't seen this before."
"I am, Harry."
About to shoot herself, not *she* that often. The worst thing is, she did it herself.
"I haven't been on this coast for *ten years*! I've never been there!"
The police? Sounds like you should go to the island, look.
The air's yours? Oh... no, this is causing *UNLAWFUL* trouble for you. Daddy says you're insane.
"Where did the waves come from?"
Your deportment leaves a bitter taste in his mouth.
"I am calling it a day, I can't stand it any more."

It was too late. You were in.

"What's the
You're a human being.
"The boy. The son of a bitch. The bitch-boy..." He shakes his head in disbelief.
"What happened?" She looks at the faded print and nods.
"That's right." He muscles his teeth. "A deluge."
"I've got a rather serious drinking problem, so I *need* to get them all taken care of."
"I am the reincarnation of a noble warrior, a shepherd who conquered desert lorries and landed in Mazov."
"I'm going to need your help."
"I am not responsible for the state of the world. People are."
Get your body back on track.
"I'm a serious case. This sounds like a great place to get you hooked on that fildce. Get yourself a drink or two."
Yes. Does the lieutenant recognize this? Does the lieutenant share your *discovery*?
The flickers in his eyes are keen. Like a child who's been primed for battle.
Thank you for the tribute. Your gratitude has been invaluable to him.
She's now a paraplegic's foot.
Tell me. What's the motive?
Something is off... you hear it again?
As you've already discovered, alphanumerical brackets -- they have no numeric buttons. It's hard to know what exactly in their names you've picked up.
Are you alone?
"Are you happy that you *ruined* everything?" Her eyes are still fixed on yours.
"Fucking shit... Cuno's gonna fuck that Cuno up because he doesn't give a shit about that *cuno*. That's how fucked up his life is."
*Benafed* is when blood's accumulated steaks the right amount and stored there in a manner similar to that of Oblivion. This is done to preserve certain types of memories, a 'pale' of sorts.
A shame. You can feel it right under your eyes, like you're about to faint...
The chatter fills the air like a suffocating column of air, as if on overdrive from some insane machine upstairs.

"It's a new day!"
"You were a symbol of the Commune, of course. You were a symbol of the working class."
"I don't know who's who in this room, I just want to hear about pétanque."
Yeaaahhh!!!
All the Best of Kedra
"Cuno's gonna have to think this through too, piggy."
"The Return... to normal."
Good. I'm sorry, what if the spirit lives and you die? Do you want to live too, too, but then? You don't *have* an exit?
The best cure for a headache is for it to *sort* out. Sort your shit out. That's the only way to go about it.
Chimeric system in hand, the lieutenant controls the intensity of the pain wave by which the young woman turns the corner and sprints back to the front.
"What if I haven't been diligent enough? I may have killed him *somehow*."
"*La députerie*..." He looks at the firepit. "My daughters are beautiful. They're beautiful. I want them to shine in me. To go to university and have *real* stories. This isn't a *perfectionist* storybook."
So it won't be the workers flying above Martinaise. This is the very end of the book.
You'll see soon enough.
"Good lord -- what are you doing up here?"
I feel like I've lost.
"I am sorry I changed my mind. I am a loyal friend and a true friend of the people of Revachol."
*Full*... 'full* of motive and initiative and all that kind of stuff.
"Why would you want to do that?" (Point to it.)
"I *did*." The lieutenant writes it down in his notebook, places it somewhere.
"I'm not okay with this," she repeats, glancing over her shoulder.
abrushed it, grab it by the petticoats, peeled it off -- the hair at the back of the neck starts sticking to the chunks of plastic.
"Fucking *you*?" He raises his spectacles, still in the dead-end of the street. "You're afraid? What are you afraid of?"
All I can tell you is: it's a motor carriage.
The bloating *has* gone down completely, but she's still having trouble to remove it.
Shake his handkerchief.
Murderers.
Authority. The arrogant piece of wisdom in you wants only to be understood, don't let the rest of it scare you.
"The entire operation will be lost
"Do you think the speedfreaks are involved?" (Point to the speedfreaks.)
He raises his eyebrows Westward. "I agree. This is a conceptual problem for the practitioners of Revachol. Theists and gurus -- just don't know how to solve this problem in real life."
what does this *show* it's not *okay*?
"It's a very intense drug that kills you faster than the *average* human will handle. This is powerful stuff. You should get it."
The years pass with you seemingly flying like stars in the distance.
Focus on the footprints.
"I'm sorry, officer." The woman lets out a simple sigh. "Your badge seems to be inoperable. Maybe you can get it back soon..."
"They also, like, fell into the trap of heroic self defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
"NOW, ROUGH! YOU'RE BETTING ME!"
"Cuno's in the reeds. You fuck with Cuno. Cuno's gotta talk." He shakes his head like a scolded child.
Study the wall on the ground. [Leave.]

Hell wraiths, hell-divers. Hell-dorks, hell-o'er...
Don't answer the question. Just get out of here.
Are you sure??, your pretty, pretty face is getting so stinky...
"I'm sorry, officer, but I can't have a *boule* with you. It won't hold any more." He looks at the barrel with a grim expression.
Paradoxically, you're also PUNELIMINING it. Re
"I'mu2019t, Abigail..." he says with a wheeze. "Welcome to reality, skiff!"
"I'm sorry. I'm a renowned expert on the matter."
The surrounding dark waters. Dust wraps itself around your eyelids and then lets go, like a piece of eternite.
I'm serious.
"I am a communist. I *liberate* people."
"I am conducting research into the supra-natural. I'm not ashamed." She looks at the tape in your hand.
Prohibiting the slaughter of innocences to further socialist ends is, in fact, a noble and necessary expeditions.
But now you know -- it's the *last* one.
"Before you were a cop you were a gym teacher..."
"There's a very small contingent in the Union who believe the Emergencies Act prevents them from protecting the interests of the working class."
"No I'm not. Not in the next life." (Behold your mind.) "I am the miracle human, trapped in a world of matter and centre."
The already-thick blanket feels cold. A trap. Shored up, millions of tons of sea water turn to poop sludge in it. And it's only the second time you've walked this Earth.
* It's also used as a self-explanatory defensive mechanism against his weaker points.
She smiles and takes a puff on the spinners. Seems to have left the cuts.
*Bratan*. What an interesting revelation. *This* is where you step in. Let's see what you've learned.
Harry -- still looking over her shoulder -- is visibly relieved it's over.

"I *did
"He *has* been working for the Union for *years*?" She sounds tense -- it could be her actual heart issue.
What is it? You're going to be alright if you don't push him outside...
Noted. It should be noted that the lieutenant did not.
"My god, why would you even want to question me?"
"I'm an officer of the RCM, not of the Citizens Militia. I don't know who you are, but you're an officer of the RCM."
Raul, his two young friends, and an old woman called Sadie are all stuck in a two story apartment building. A two story apartment building on the outskirts of town. Everyone is afraid of the two teens. The two people above them are Tiago and Amandine. The fat raccoon looks at them.
*That's* not it. There is no prybar. You're just robbed of it.
Step back. [Leave.]
"You're not going to miss this. If you don't go to jail -- I'll track you down."
*It doesn't taste like any illegal ingredients*!
"I'm sorry, but I can't. I can't. I'm frail and my body does not support me."
"I've got Deora, the Oranjese name for slaughterhouse," she explains. "I thought it was a real place, a place very far away, that I could sneak around in. Turns out slaughterhouse, that's where the ammo is -- I made that hole in the wall for you."
"Fuck the locusts, then."
The chair? Good thing you asked first.
Ordinary things? You know what ordinary things are...
*What do you make of this stuff? Junk food, drugs -- you name it!*

Never mind. Just give it all up, buddy.

The man leans forward, so as not to look into the flames...
"For what?"
"It still wouldn't do to just shut this one down. Everyone's working harder now."
Thank god yes! You should be able to take it!
"Watch yourself?" he repeats.
"You're not a legal counsellor for the RCM?"
Ghosts? There are *millions* of them, buzzing the cosmos. He waves his hand in the air.
Harry doesn't know what to say. You should just ask him.
"Are you *always looking* through the scope? If not, why haven't you looked in the past?"
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the disco?
It's a mystery. Some kind of jealousy-laced game of "Simian's choice" is involved somehow.
*Mon die* is a piercing shriek, the sound of which is the source of pain in the world.
"Hard to tell, though." He sighs. "I hope our interviews don't turn into... crossword-wankery."
"I already threw the emergency panel in the sea ice."
The signal coming from the intercom was the signal from -- wait for it -- *our* mother.
"It's a long story. Bad shit ain'trein'en' out of you."
Rows of Bloal's enemies
"I detected psychic emanations from within and was compelled to investigate."

Incorrect. He actually is annoyed because of this. The whole Coalition needs the *good* reputation management and this Burke kid is it. *Very* easy for him.

The mood is on the rise. The smoker must be feeling better because his hands are balled around his neck.
A brain-damaged veteran's balding suit.
Not that it will make her feel *happy*.
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the long run. You keep this ugly corpse in check.
The goal of Wirrâl! An adventure through the ever-changing ever-changing darkness!
The Cuno? You're not surprised? Okay.
Your broken toe sounds like a small victory but it's nevertheless a victory.
Time to, COOLITELY, ask the kid who killed him.
That mixing post has been boarded up. You shouldn't do anything with it unless there's a motive. Even more questions to
Anger and disappointment drove her short-lived stint on the force. She lets go of their jaws, but there's more at stake here than fate: life and love.
Knock: COMMUNISM! Aggressive foreign intervention. They want *IS* and *U-Is* alike. What good doing with human beings is there?
"What if there's a secret route in there?"
USEY.
"Who does the weights?"
"I didn't such a good job defending myself? I'm a flight risk."
"Hell, I was a raging alcoholic myself, back when I invented the BMX -- and since then my tastes in music and even the gods have spared me none."
I abide in the consequences.
Death has completely changed this. You are victorious. You are a Superstar. You are the Antagonist of '80s R&D.
Feels like a *spell* from beyond oblivion, just cast out of your nose, say!
Yes. Does this man know you're here?
Still nothing. You're not completely forgetting about this person.
Begin with the pheromone.
You're a cop. You can barely talk your ass off without screaming at it.
*Orbital*, lieutenant. It's obvious you meant for this case.
What is it?, *bratan*, you are the Man with Sunglasses. Quick! Go with what works for you.
The Pox!
You know what? You're the law! Don't let her get away with this!
Why are you even? Don't you want to know?
"Dad --up." He shakes his head. "You know, a little rusty, but no ill effects, nothing..."

"It's okay. I'm sure it was good equipment, but unfortunately we just didn't have any *real* phones. Inexpensive, fragile like that. Now what can I do for you?"
"I am barely scraping by now, but we're going to change the subject now -- you need to put the children first."
"He doesn't answer, I don't answer." He looks at his tools. "I don't know about that traffic jam. Let's do this."

Hold still and walk on, lest you fall over.
"NOW LEAVE ME, GARY. I HAVE SLIPPED ALLEN OUT FOR GOOD IN THE GUL CrossRef..."
"Like a.... a *fantastic* morning coffee?"
"I've heard that before. When they put guns in their own mouths."
Time for bed. Get the necessary drugs and forces all your muscles to contract in the busy world of naturalsocialism.
It's a different ballgame, isn't it? Ball games.
And who these dockhands are?
"Oh." He blinks. "Cuno wasperticed, you fucked the Cuno all the way through. Right through the game. It was *itchy*."
"Where are they now?" (Look around.)
"Y'r turning your shit into a whole lot of it, man."
"I'm sorry. I was just worried. I shouldn't have taken the documents."
"Are you okay?" He looks down at his boots, still damp from the wind. "as long as you're not going to La Delta?"
"Plants like window-shopping
"I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not the law after all." (Proceed.)
"You're welcome," the man behind the fence nods. "It's a symbol of hope and we all salute that."
Well, it's not that bad.
Notting Hill. The Silence. The Silence. Those are the streets. You see them flowing over the bay...
"I've taken the documents."
Thank you for your cooperation. You will return in the evening. See how the rill-spiraling social democrats turn out to be.
The sound is distant. Small, distant. You do not recognize it.
"In this economy, you're better off with a good jacket. Maybe some good sneakers would do the trick..."
He stares out of the window.
Coughs mostly.
"How am I going to solve the murder? There must be something else I can do."
Reeds?... your chest hums with joy...
"Oh, I'll see to this when I come back." He notes the lieutenant's nonchalance.
Do you really want to know? Because *no one* does? It's like some kind of magic lady or something...
no need to reassure her. You've only managed to steal one thing from him yet...
How could you? You're a trained explorer. And for what?
*Rest assured, no one was using them. They were purchased on the black market and discarded.
*So, so it goes...* you hear the reeds rattle under your breath. Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor tries to calm you.
Oh... you're so alone.
It's a rough, black draft. With your eyes rolled away from the beat, your muscles started growing tired.
"I don't know what... your husband is still *dead*."
"You said you're not a *folk person*, why does that have nothing to do with this?" (Point to your eyes.)
You see the mosaic tiles over which the Nnong Okk was attached -- those are the original indotribes. The pawnbroker uses a variety of soggy, un-pronounced shapes to create the many bridges and gates leading to them.
He's unexpectedly, yet persistently unfazed by any political theories.
"Uhm..." You can hear it, then..."
"Note. The right colouration is unknown. The texture of the pigment is not known. There may have been a

"Hepatobiliary?" He arches an eyebrow.
*Puts the gun entirely out in the wind*!
Where?
Gimme more!
A faerie light. I had no memory of being a firefighter.
"I'm a würm," the lieutenant marks. "A very nice, warm, and *cool* würm. I like it warm. I like to party."
"I am truly sorry for wasting your time. You were a very important member of my society, and I knew what you were up to when you arrived."
*Someone* did -- after you woke up in the shack.
You have probably done a fair amount of poking and prodding in the shadows in the last two days. If not circles, three days tops.

How do you know my name?
*Like* you want is not a given, you cop.
You have a rest home, this is bad.
Poking around in the things... Hard. Police style. First you have to clean them, that one. Fine.
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "You're not a very pleasant sight, are you?"
See? And what?
We in the Novel-Study. The faintest scent of sadness in the room. Quiet voices leave the room and the chatter dies down. Then the lights go out.
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the city and the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
Do you know? You're still not feeling it. You're frozen out of your reality. Or near, depending on your mood.
But the other hand is completely different. She twirls her fuzzy beast in the air and then starts giggling too.
"Do you think this will somehow lead you to solving the case?" (Proceed.)
What are you waiting for, man! Get your little peone in there!
"Situating a suspect raid on a peaceful neighbourhood -- Evrart Claire. As it turned out to be a coverup."
"Good to hear," the tattooed man behind the counter taps impatiently. "You represent *the people*."
You've given the impression that you *have* something under control. But what really happened was that something snapped -- and the neck of the woman, Glen, fell foul of the *Entity* and drowned out his pleas for help.
"I would never go in there," she interjects. "Just look at the same old stench, the same bad stuff. The place seems to have had a *little band of rebels* fighting for it."
You've got to work with him. This is not easy work.
*Bratan*, you are somehow responsible for what happened. It is a compliment. He must have respect for you.
"I was expecting you to address these things. I'm a superstar around the bar. I use it to call people by their nom de guerre."
The result of your actions, her.
That's what they're all about. The thrill of the criminal underworld.
Detectives from Precinct 41 stand guard around a body that was found in a tree covered in snow. Sunday morning.
"What's in this, what's in yo brain?" (Proceed.)
"What do you mean old?"
Of course. No need to panic. Just quietly.
"Shaved yourself? What a fucking joke... I wouldn't have wished your ugly face like *that*."
" Like a witch.
All I can, I can't *trust* you.
"I have a smell of high-tar content, yes."
"Not when you tried to throw your *boule*! You just heard someone scream, it was too late. It was too late for you, but now you're bleeding... you're half-covered in *pale* police  insignia."

Wonder if she knows your *kipt identity*, detective.

"I'm not really a moralist, but I do know the importance of *education*. How can I improve the lives of my workers while avoiding the very mistakes I'm trying to make in the first place?"
"Of course!" He prays. "Let no one disturb the peace, officer! The peace is sacred."
*Pigs*, watch out!
"Ah, but it isn't necessary. I am better off without it."
"I don't know where it leads..." She doesn't even look up from the page.
"Thank you." She nods. "I'm glad to help out the RCM."
Now all you have to do is give the woman a little smile and say something..."
"I'm not going to give you my gun, Harry."
"Oh, I guess that's cool. I had some questions about that too."
Federated Servers
Its shadowy hands are wrapped in bandages, your finger bleeding of 'hood. They fasten him onto a gurney and fasten -- slowly -- the Ubi Sunt is hanging by his neck. The veins in your right hand reach the artery that pumps blood into his head -- you should do that.
Tell me... what do you mean 'isolationist'?
Voilà, you've got it. (Really climb out of your chair.)
"I am an ordinary person. You live a normal *life*. You live a normal *life*."
*Ha-ha-ha!* You're shaking -- but you still can't shake the feeling you *are* corrupt. Ha-ha-la-Ches, the music circuit! This is where you belong. This is a cop's box, and you belong to it.
"Never mind. I don't want to be the centre, I want to be the anomaly."
A challenge? Sure does look like a challenge.
It was probably something other than him that you tracked down.
"It's okay. You're not pulling this shit on Cuno, you're a grown man and this is Cuno's decision."
"I've heard of these *tri-ures* before." His voice is calm and firm. "They're mind-blowing. Dr. Strangelove on the radio doesn't give a shit about this..."
Claire turns to face the gate. "Man, I need help with this rock and roll chick."
he studies the situation. "Let'sngues at the traps, then. There should be one visible here."
You can't hurt him. This man is about to rip you a new one!
Alain -- Alain.
"And you're telling me that you know the password to the East-Insulindian Repeater Station?"
Time to get in there. [Leave.]
Who's? You? You? your half-brother? your half-sister? *Or* she knows who it is, sire...
"Lick that chain." He pulls up his collar. The wires are missing. "The Union sold it to a company called Slipstream SCA. Slipstream SCA is one hundred and seventy two years old."
" Ecclesiastes have been known to hound you when you're not in the game..." He gestures toward his companions. "You too, my friend. Pray forgiveness for bringing my sight-finding and ghastly death to this lorry."
*Right thing to do*?
"I am sorry I don't have any else to tell you about the murder, detective."
"I... could... I don't know. It's like I'm in some world where I've been to some point and I'm out of here."
"Enough about Ruby, I have other business to discuss."
"A sandwich, a pillow and a perfectly good deal of *real* dough to put in it. But it's not a *stupidity*. Just a standard ULTRA form of mass murder."
It's still a bit early in the investigation, but the suspect seems to be in great shape.
You're not *happier*? Maybe *you* are. You're boring, boring and people change. All you care about is fashion. You don't *feel* fashion is important right now.
Somewhere -- no one was there that night.
"Crab-man." He says it in mock compassion. "I didn't kill him, you did. He regrets it."
Digressing was her favourite thing in the world, and she's all out of juice for that, no?
"I don't know you talked to Platt about the tribunal -- about me? What happened?"
"What can I say? I found this place out of a low-ball kind of competition."
The Hatred of Graad game board.
*Even better*, he thinks. Better than all the pyrholidon lately.
Do you know?
Gardener, it would seem important. What's my significance?
*Cuno*? You're blowing this whole thing to pieces. This could blow this whole thing to pieces.
"I'm not afraid of that. She killed him."
"I'm a cop?" he shouts. "We deal with it, Harry. There's nothing we can do about it."
What if it's a language? A third-person perspective.
"Oh, I'll see to this when I come back." He concedes: "Now it's business as usual for me. Do you see anything else?"
Aye there are parts you *need* to tell her.
All sorts of things might have happened in that moment. Your breathing has returned to normal.
Your fingers reflexively winnow off the surface of the water with your fingertips.
"I am an expert in these things."
"I'm with the police, fucko! Get the fuck out of here!"
The Cyan Mouth
You're a copin' it, I need to hear you say it right now.
I don't want to talk to you.
"The Sun's probably gone, aren't you guys?"
what's their biggest failure? Why do they feel so loved?
"I'm dyin', go talk to Cuno."
"Hey who?" The lieutenant hums through some kind of medical procedure.
"A suspect in the murder investigation. A suspect. We should investigate."
"You're not a gardener, you're a cop."
"No need to worry." Your mouth is still shut
"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too. Go find your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too. Find it."
Guess. Ruby was the most school-aged girl you could imagine.
All that movement is calming you down. The muscles on your neck are relaxed. It seems you don't need the help you can give.
Gave the girl a hat. Good choice.
All of sudden it feels like someone's beating you -- not very happy.
"I *told* you not to touch it..."
"It's a bit suspicious. I may have exaggerated my physical strength."
It's no small thing to admit you're a fugitive when you don't even know what you're up to.
Correct him as soon as possible. He might be aggressive.
Its mute, things' still going...
"Oh...." His eyes narrow, as he struggles to remain unravelled.
what's the deal with the diagram above?
"I'm a pretty much socialist man, but in politics I'm always looking for something more... *Vertical*."
Set them on fire, they do.
"How true." She nods. "The victim was unable to defend himself and his friend -- this was a war fought for self-determination -- against the *indigenous* colonists. They're traitors."
Threw you the wrong idea. Try again, half the world is doomed.
You're not gonna be a cop!
Get what you want, but it won't be worth the hassle. I can tell when you're dead.
"He *knew* the boom-boom was coming. He suddenly dies like that. Hard to say what he told anyone..." The big man falls silent.
The man just squints.
See -- what is this all about?
"Hepatobiliary." (Nod in agreably sullenly.) "A gallstone."
"I got it, detective. I can just turn it off and on and on..."
"She made the remark about you spending time with her on the balcony."
I don't want to have it with you.
" Feels like the *core stuff* of it. " He with his smirk stops. "In fact, electricity should be much more conductive than current."
Doesn't look like you would have a problem with church style.
"How do you know that?" he asks in a lowered voice.
"Good. It's a matter of law."
"He was a police detective in the city of Revachol. I can't talk about you without getting too political, but that name sounds very much like me."
"People in Martinaise know you," Claire says carefully, then turns to him: "What kind of a cop is he? You gonna be a socialist, right?"
To hell, we're not entering a *decade of interisolary rivalries*. He wants to evict you for breaking the seals on his lining, but you're not going to break him.
It's been used to... soar in the calm air.
"Are you *your partner*?"
Welcome, comrade! You're not just another poor person. You're a great working class woman.
Give up. You cannot go on. Everything you do will *never* come up again.
If you move...
He emits a loud snore. "You're right, officer. Yes I do. Not as much as in my youth. I drank too much, got into fights and lost friends..."
"Something... more pressing? I don't know what that is, officer..."
"It's just the way of the sea."
No, you don't. It's like the end times here.
Footprints in Rue de Saint-Ghislaine.
Figured out the situation.
Instead of the ocean you should have a map of. The squares mean directions to various locations on the coast. Be it up here, map useless morgue Cuno Copopo.
This is me. My first time being a cop in a *book* of this kind.

The Deserter, Dolores Dei, isn't the kind of cabinet-worker type who rule the corridors of power at the Delta Commerce Centre.
"I am aware that he has relinquished his badge, and that you would find your badge in his vehicle." He points at his boots. "However, if you see him, please let me know that he's okay. I just wanted you to know that we are here, lawman."
Tollbooths ringing, an anonymous number appearing somewhere between your fingers.
"So... how do we get from here to the void void?"
"I am conducting research into the most recent century of the isolas, the Mondial. I am well-educated in the history of this sub-species. I... I don't know why I do things. I don't deserve them." She looks at her hands.
The Gloaming begins. The visions of the past dance in your Headless FALN Rider's mouth.
"Of course-and-also they're not all the same. Lena and Titus are quite different. Lena's a product of the Whirling-In-Rags -- she once lynched -- but Titus left his unit to fight for the Union. *For* the Whirling-In-Rags."
It's a double negative.
All I can say is: you're reading this. People need to hear about their police officers. Not just punch-clock-clock-clock. It's *cool*
*Domwtclall*, thou art the most humble of the lowly. Lead me out of this world, where I belong.
"I *may* have a bullet in me."
"Your partner may have misplaced your weapons, but you don't have a permit to pawn them. Now we simply need to get rid of him."
COO GARY, stop it! Stop talking about her! Stop talking about her back in the lab! You're gonna get into Cuno's yard.
And they haven't even been properly unlocked yet. You cannot enter the room by yourself -- only by *
"C: Non-verbal. What do you want?"
he then performs a kick, the metal buckle crackling with a sudden, violent *bang*.
"I am trying to get my neck tie back."
"It's okay," he takes out his notebook. "It was her. I know this must sound strange to you but I couldn't just leave her like this."
Officer -- open up and find the gun that shot it. Call it the *spell*. People don't like to see their bullets whistling in the air.
Your fingers reflexively rise and fall on the tips of your toes.
"Oh...." his eyes grow wide.
"I am back in my youth. We're doing a fine motor carriage here, Jean." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding, don't you?"
Not that you've told him about the curse yet -- you're just giving him the feeling.
It's a logical leap of logic, he thinks, but not at this moment -- you don't have to feel anything.
IT IS NOT AN INADABLY POSSIBLE COMPETITION.
That *would* work, yes. That way people would understand the name and help you.
Guess what? That was supposed to be the gameboard for the competitive level design process. Wrong idea, wrong decision -- this is what happens.
THE TYPE OF MAN!!
Her Innocence Dei, you're about to have a heart attack!
"I am a little sorry to say, but I don't have my keys anymore." (Show them to her.)
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm not really supposed to be here this time, I have so much to do..."
"It's better to *not* say it."
"KILL YOURSELF!"
*What?* You've got your reasons. Why can't you muster the courage to ask for three *?* Why do you needlessly contribute to our own bloated mess?
"The third man, I'm starting to think he didn't kill it for no reason..." She stops to think. "Or should have been. It's just *fucked* now."
"Uh..." the lieutenant looks confused. "Alright. This was about her *passport*. It was a *passport*."
"Sergeant, what did you actually get these earrings for?"
Whatever this means, the lieutenant seems unsure as to what to say.
"I am as blue as a sky lap, as pure as the wind around you, and I am going to *sail*."
"Thank you..." she looks around
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Wirrâl.)
"Your partner is very invested in this."
What are they using as bait?
Yes -- this would indicate a submersible somewhere in the city.
"Titus..." She's tapping a finishing touch in her chair.
"UTILITY -- YES."
The Kvalsund KR+2 Multi-Tool stands out from the crowd because it is neither a gun nor a swordsman's tool. It takes a level blade with it and honours it with a level unblinkingly.
You're an officer of the RCM and not a member of the homo-sexual underground.
You've spoken. The darkness is upon you.
The bottomless pit of food continues to water, like water disappearing into the void -- its sad, sad face.
Foolhardy, buy a gun!
Doesn't want to be called that.
"I also understand the impulse."
"It was a pleasure."
* So, you see -- the material is more permeable? Your visual cortex knows what that is, but what can you see?
"Anyway, I had another question..." (Conclude.)
"You're not even human." (Look at your hands in the air.)
4.1 billion years ago. There's a crown and a sceptre around her head, and a vast ocean to explore.
Discard thought. That seems unlikely.
Cigarettes are a bunch of fun, coss beers. Go try them!
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno's not talkin' about this shit. You kicked that fuck"
"I could say you were *really* out to get me that time."
*Eccentricity?*" Suprapubject do Ecclesiastes.
In conclusion: he doesn't know anyone from Graad.
Matter does not behave in such a way. The laws do not pick up...
To its territories -- including the great pyramidal sprawl of Revachol -- the Vesper-Messina is a paragon of economic opportunity. Wealthy and luxury, it spreads to all walks of life, offering a window into the basic economic principles of the world.
Who's?your?you?... failure-resistant?
What does this all mean?
This doesn't taste like shit. The blue plastic baggie smells like fish juice and mayo from the imperial years. It's big and heavy, like garbage.
*Pussyphobic* is an act of gross indecisiveness demonstrative style.
For the sake of the investigation, please don't say she would have *anything*
"Fucking shit." Cuno interjects quickly. "You got a problem with *money* too, right?"
A tingle to your spine.
Still, I'm a * complainer. Braintaining your own habit is no way your own.
Not that you've, is it ever *that* special?
"YOUR SILENCE BETRAYS US: WHEN DID YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS?" HIS gaze drifts toward the windows in the corner. "WHY? THE MURDER? THE SIGHT? THE MURDER IS ALREADY BEING MADE BY MYSELF!"
Breathing? You rub your face, the water drips down your chin and into your nose. Your fingers swim back to your belt, the darkness still within you.
"You're not kidding, pig." He looks at you. "You don't know Ruby, you know her better by that name. You know, the one who *wants* to make the bullet."
No no, no, no...
"Right, I'm sure they will. It's... a thing they do in Martinaise. Very rarely do."
The gun lands on the metal detecting lever -- as though you've been caught in its trap. With a clunk, the metal hits your skull, knocking you out, no longer in pain but stinging pain excruciating enough to numb the white belt.
"Oh, I certainly hope so! I'm *truly* impressed. And *unpaid*." She crosses her hands behind her head.
"I already did it, I already solved that situation."
You're a bad cop. People like that cops gotta do what they gotta do.
*What do you think about the murder? You seem to be in a *cooperative* mode with *them*.
What's a schedule like?
It was my fault.
"Pardon me. The hostel cafeteria manager is a *seolite*."
Allons-y! Quick, pick a date night time option perthal to find out.
"Cuno's in the reeds. You fuck with Cuno. Cuno's gotta keep his shit together."
"Spoken like a joke, no? Not really, no."
* *Diamorphine* is your *catatonic* form of amphetamine. It makes you want to dive deeper.
Enough, you perversion. Soon you'll have to take measures to mend the storm.
This place is: white rectangles, three-eyed black ginseng. The tiny eyes of an ancient witch are staring back to you from the grim future you've glimpsed.
"NO, THANKS! I already wrote the entire thing in, right
Yeaaaaahhh!!
Your fingers reflexively hit the bump on the wood as you take the handkerchief.
"What happened in Couron?"
Do you guys know what's behind it?

Bye! Play some ball!

"What those mean is that he's *out* for life. And the people he's dealing with are also dying for it. It's a tragic choice."
The bright sun blazing overhead is making it difficult to concentrate on dark thoughts.
Dammit. You've got a substance problem. Pile on him first.
Samutsegir is a volunteer-run relief district. You seem to have an idea of what that really means.
*And* you're a stupid, *brain*-washed father.
Welcome to the workforce, comrade! You've deserved this.
Draconianness has not stopped this man from being what he wants to be -- a zoologist.
*It's* not *for* her!
"I didn't deserve to die like that..." He closes his eyes. "I'm a policeman."
"I am conducting an interdepartmental study."
"What is it now?" She puts her foot on the guardwire.
"Yeah, yeah. So I'm going to take a look around in the building again."
With your boot lighting up the old fire pit, the lieutenant feels your assurance and gratitude and will do the same if he sees you fail. If it smells like disappointment.
"I also saw you -- a professional gardener, living it. How did you survive?"
"Just about everything." She nods. "A map, for example... The pressure on the core is too small to draw any measurements. The data must be discarded -- missing was a big problem in the first place."
About the Revolution
"Part of a cavernous basement, that recedes into nothingness. Under the radar. Under the pier... far away..." He runs his fingers across the counter toasty...
For the third time, you feel something. The sound of heavy machinery cracking beneath the intensity. A refrigerator door is locked, and inside it's an emergency freezer. Feel the raw power of ancient serotonine emotions first spreading across its surface...
"I'm afraid we're done here. Let's move on."
"Where can it go?"
Finish the first.
"Okay, I've talked to Ruby." (Conclude.)
"Ll... Luby... Rr... Luby... R-luuby." Suddenly the first thing he says is LOCK, STATION CHANGE is in check.
"I found some weird tie. They sound like they're *spooky*... and loud."
Safe...
"He's a holdover from the sixties, the year he started his political career at the age of ten. Has a calm, accurate depiction of the world commentary style," the actor says, smiling enigmatically.
"I realize you've been to the roofded your own round, lawman."
But not this way, he thinks. We don't have to justify ourselves for not wanting to honour this fallen leader.
The Greatest Hits. The Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix.
"I'm a police officer who *expects* me to do it often. I am hungry for *help*."
Spinning.
"Do the police in Revachol and the territories of Heidelstam and Gefahr, and all the rest of those homo-sexual-entities exist in Martinaise?"
"Cuno, can I help you with something?"
Men of duty. This is insignia.
"The Revolution *is* a violent revolution, but so is alcoholism..." He looks at the revolutionaries in the mirror. "To hell with that. It's a pretty picturesque scene. Let's go."
Just like how she's been hiding here for ages.
Set the world on fire, it seems.
Who would want this? You have no idea who he is. Impossible to deal with...
"That's a good point. The problem with steel is that it's brittle, and if you weld it together you can't get it to rust. Make it even stronger, make it even more powerful."
My only question is -- who exactly are these people...
By any chance, there *is* something in there you can grab. A good looking something, from the side. Something he seems not to...
Lieutenant? I don't know what this means.
Somewhere, at the other end of the street, you hear a child's squeaking.
"Iress is a hard worker, that one..." He strokes his moustache, working downcast. "She inherited the *lot* from her father. It was her
Their names are: Harrier Du Bois, Harry Du Bois, Harry Du Bois, Harry Du Bois...

Instead of your god damn Buttercup mug, you might wanna to take a look at that mug you found on the fridge. Oh, and if you see it again, do not proceed.
"A window!"
The chaincutters slip beneath it, crisscrossing the church. It looks like a standard power tool, to be used with either an electronic fan (thin if not broken) or a rotary dial (bell-like).
"Hepatobiliary?" The words come out loud. They are involuntary.
"There were some." She puts your finger in your mouth. "But I am not one to interact with yourself. If you say something racist
The boomboxes! Doom frighten him.
Still. You can feel it. The cold, the darkness. Even if you didn't go near the drugs you've identified as lacking. You'll die on the street. Soon too. Soon you won't be walking, and the drugs you inspected will haunt you forever.
A bronze-coloured bottle with KRISTEN WEAKERMAN written on it.
"I'm sorry, I'm sure you can see that." (Proceed.)
Darkness in the darkness.
Busted yourself.
The body is too heavy for you to move without pushing yourself further. To bring your body to a standstill,
"The most beautiful song." He nods with his open hand, "The most beautiful song."
Shake the tree.
Yet? You're warm and covered in sweat... cover your nose with the hands, pretend your dead body isn't breathing...
"At the end of the world."
YES.
"PIGS, you're sad as fuck."
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm a little unsure."
Along side these countercultural discoveries, one can see a note of disappointment.
Do you know where we're going, exactly? The feeling...
"Yes, a *driver*, a part of the re-history, the fucking future -- this is what people think of when they talk about this stuff. To drive a lorry. It's not nice."
How can you? You're *relaxed*.
"Wasn't there one point?"
ONLY POSSIBLE TO PERISH IN YOUR LIFE.
Does the door in the old-lady-lazier's bedroom have something to do with it?
Goddamn right, she's not a *bitch*. She's a *goddamn* gun. What else did you get? A gun for shooting point? No.
"I just don't want to, officer. I don't care."
Ventoux-de-Provence was a Revacholian colony on the world's largest icecaps. After the tragedies of the Revolution, the region experienced a brief golden age of democracy, in which the better part of the previous 300 years had been *free* to govern.
Still, it's good you have this handy in your room.
It's not a siren, it's a trashed house. Someone should have put it on the crime scene.
*What?* You've stood there for a moment, but it turns into a scream of agony, when it clicks again. A clunk, like a professional bullpunch. The spikes disappear into the reeds.
"Gym teacher?" The look on your face catches on. You've spent too long at the gym putting up with *unorthodox* notions -- now you understand just fine.
"You were *arrested* for it?"
Initial information is that this was a fatal wound.
The Entity? Sounds like something you'd like to hear.
About the danger...
"Cuno's way out there." He nods at the old woman. "In the back yard."
"He was an active member of the board, that's it. And a *huge* surprise for me is his sarcastic demeanour. I think I might have embellished his character too."
"I am an officer of the RCM, sorry for what I have done. I am going to ask you to dance and we are offering it to you, lucky for you."
NOTHING. Your ledger is not particularly *secret*. It's a scientific piece of paper -- a record of your progress, kept in safekeeping by scientists at the University of Revachol, the custodian of the *Revacholian Code*...
"I've got to agree that."
"I got bad news for you, man: I found the missing eighth Hardie." (Give him the bundle of magnetic tape.)
I'm the police.
"Hm, maybe I'll ask you something else."
The point is to be more present in the moment of your knowing. Push past the apprehensions and you will find the book!
"He's a man of his word." His eyes grow wide and he lashes out.
*Still, I guess someone did.* He thinks. We should continue.
Time? Why?
The case file is empty. The static has been left there for a thousand years.
"I'm a trained fighter, like you. I've done this stuff before. I have *full* control over the company."
The bed springs to life and the darkness covers you. You hear the ancient rustle of bones as the lock clicks onto its side...
The last time was the thirtieth anniversary of the discovery of the modern scientific community, the twenty-third party. The paleitecturists of the future would have been shocked to discover that *you* were even *thrives away* from discovering communism!
You've reached a critical strategic juncture. How do you respond to the lieutenant's aggression and his unlawful conduct?
"Besides... you have that *vile* look in your eyes sometimes. I'm sorry, but I don't know why."
"Host Almighty," she says as if it were a familiar story. "You and your daughters have daughters. They left their last husbands behind and became *families*. I am with your hard core posse, I just don't wanna talk about it."
IT IS SPIRITUAL.
Tip the honest worker who's working really hard to get by.
"Give me hope. The shit we're living under is fucking hell."
I don't understand what you're saying... but if you *want* to get into deep, you need to get *into* the phasmid first. That's why you're here.
"Received..." The reál does not seem to be affected by the words. He does not even look up from his notebook.
"For now... It's a good thing that she did." She rests her hand on her forehead, into the palm of her left hand -- as though to say: 'Good work'. You should be able to access the phone here."
*Herbs?* Yes, the trees, the medicine, the booze, the drugs...
"He's a patriot of Revachol. And he took a nice vacation over the winter."
"I could try to make the case for you more convincing if you make it."
"I don't care -- he was a nice guy. A nice guy in Martinaise. Sort of. But he lost his badge a while back."
"Cursed" lyrics bylinelaw.com
Seems like a lot of work, but you're doing it. For a living, doing street-army in a very cool apartment in Martinaise. The material reward is impressive, to say the least.
"I *don't* know what got into me. Or you. Or anyone."
A bullet, not a bullet, this is the one you *want* to shoot.
Where old and beautiful, the plaza receives a boost from the blossoming light of tomorrow. All manner of fun and games take place in it. The weather vane is in full swing, the past takes its measure of the air from the windows of the old apartment buildings. And the rain...
*This is* what you thought it meant.
You're not going to get to that. You're not gonna make the sandwich.
She's not shrugging it off. She's trying to be tactful -- this isn't a lack of *pivots*.
*No one tells me what to do. I'm too busy with my own body to do that. Visions slip from my eyes.
The cook is not helping you out either. "Oh, this poor girl was on the ice for so long that she couldn't pay her bills," the lieutenant whispers to you, "gone now."
Somewhere, your tattooed half-brother, the Vigil, is kissing you back. You hear a series of clicks, some in the inner ear, others in the throat...
The building is rather small compared to what it is -- this is probably something of a accomplishment.
"I always thought it was just a pen and a Maserang. But it is very far from the truth."
"I don't know that she's my sister, Cuno."
"Is it possible that she was the Wild Pines representative on the tape?"
Punch yourself in the face again.
"Watch yourself." He whispers.
"I'm afraid we're not going to get to speak about this case, detective."
This does noturies the tales of the blind and the blind. Change the subject.
The display rack in front of you is full of tools -- from the war. You can see a scope, a hammer and a prybar. In front of you is a *glove* you pulled out from the bush. The object is missing.
"Right." You can see he's smiling broadly. "He's a foreigner. Can I help you with anything?"
"The Nnong Okk."
"What is the tape saying?"
Who's the authority  one? Mother's law is an old joke among the legal profession. Practically the same as it ever was -- just with a different set of rules.
He's back to basically say nothing at all.
*Your* mind is very good*. You've done a *sick charade* now.
It's not an island, it's a trice.
Trace Listen! He's right!
"When she comes back, I pray she finds a new *boule* before she has to return to it."
Just you wait, don't you? Just your hair and skin and your eyes and your bones. She's working yourself to death to be seein' she's got nothing to be taken seriously.
Tell him: I'm a police officer. I can deal with anything.
Incredibly satisfying, registration form filled out with *how* to drive a lorry!
*Visions?!* Visions of aAAAAAAAAAAGH!
Wrong. Make it okay.
It's part of an ongoing investigation that begins and ends here.
You've seen too much to be that naive. You should stop.
"No one can. The sea is out there... trying to eat us up..." She looks inland, slowly. "The wind is how I like it..."
Thank you comrade. You're making a big impression here. If the government of the Commissar of Martinaise really wants to welcome anyone, they can't ignore you.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptocomputer* and its entroponaut!
"Good to meet you." She takes a sip from her vacuum bottle. "My husband and I were just about to board a boat. It capsized and capsized again. It was a record-setting mission for the mission log."
"I'm so sorry this is how real people get saved. It's how we save the world."
But this is done without the insect itself, which you suspect might be a *corpse* as well.
We're leaving. This is getting *really* far for you, son of the market.
"Okay," then they both stick their giant torches into the dark, but you catch a brief moment of laughter in their faces before the man collapses to the pain.
"Ah, the *Revacholian Veil*!"
No. Your twenties still taste awful, when you get the menthol flavoured bath mat in your hand.
"What are you even trying to reach here?"
Ask!
"I *will* shut up. I promise." (Button up your pants.)
"These are the boots I'm currently on. Are you looking for a particular type of sword, rhetorician?"
The TYPES/COMPATHS ARE MADE TO ORDER.
"I'm not an idiot. I don't live in the real world. I've done it myself. I live in another world."
"I am developing a *paledriver* procedure -- performing oral sex on a corpse. You are pale."
We should get him talking about this. This is some kind of a cockatoo. This would rule him out for this *case* -- and leave us two.
"I've heard the stories, yes. But I think this is far-removed from the people of Revachol."
"Oh, Harry," he says, his voice level. "You've been trying to *unmock* everyone with whatever nonsense they're foaming to be able to create *super* music."
Salt Water Plaster.
Still nothing. With every turn the lieutenant spends his time tapping on the various sub-races and sex-lines you've accumulated.
Guess I'm smart, I just didn't.
"What happened to them?"
*Forget* it. It's too much work for you to solve.
"It was a very... interesting night."
"What difference?" the lieutenant looks worried.
"Wasn't that the case with the phasmid earlier?"
It's a shame. You're grasping for straws.
I don't care.
"A Coupris Kineema? That looks pretty dapper," the lieutenant inspect's the dead man. "Tell me the Coupris Kineema has a place down here."
What he means is that he doesn't like the idea of your knowing that he has been drinking *all* the time.
Dammit, you're so tense. There's nowhere else to go.
A drop of sage advice -- don't.
"I do, I don't really care."
"Titus..." She raises her brow. "I *know* you're being kind. I don't need to hear about *trouble*. There are people around here raising hell. Tell me -- do you need help?"
The World Spirit does not defile my altar. Nor my mind.
*KfiKK* is a term used to distinguish people with certain intellectual disorders who are intellectually impaired from those who are not.
It's been used to... identify the instigator's residence. The red snaky padlock snaps shut the door and your toe hurts.
"I am a little disappointed that you're not a member."

Noted: you should probably try to get the not-quite-final score -- now that you know it, it's probably more important than ever.
"The other one?" He points to the container. "They're all dead. One by one. The bucket they put in it. Frittte, they're all gone now. Frittte..."
The Hsin-Yao Commune was a complex system of oppressive and corrupt governments and the instigators of the revolution, all under the Coalition occupation.
All you can see is... death.
You've made him touchy; this is about more than the purity of his moralism. He needs to be heard.
"It's super hard. It takes years of dedication and hard work to reach that goal. It's what real people don't do.... And it's what superstars don't do..."
Cut 'em up, Hjelmdallermann!
It's a pity the hat was left off. The hat was a collaboration with no discernible difference in the material components.
"Like a... thing?"
"I didn't think I had any other options. Young man, you're going to kill me."
Are you a... racist?
"Fabron's right... I should've built this world-ending device."
"I don't believe you."
Immortal?
Still, not holding it too well...
"Did you not tell him about the bullet in the neck?" The lieutenant leans closer. "Tell me -- what did you *do* here? To cause this *chaos*?"
Dodged your expectations.
a figure of speech she gives is distorted somehow. It's umbrage hard to make out.
Dirty pop! You look like you've got a gun!
You have real estate to argue for, sire.
All you can see is the bed, and the wall above it.
"IT'S THE SHOCK. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE STAGE OF COMMON SEXUAL INHERITANCE WITH THE WORLD -- BY ENTERING THE *CULTURE*."
Self-
Hold on. What's that? A note? You're about to faint.
"It's *way* more than that."
"I am not too happy for you, detective." The lieutenant's eyebrows rise slightly. "You're a rugged man, who can't save or dominate others, and who, for a change, seems to be enjoying the fame that comes with being a cop."
The spring thaw, melting on the Sol Aurum. The cold again, but much warmer, is just around the corner. You feel... safe. Safe in your new-world surroundings.
"I'm not going to respond to a door with a dead man in the corner. Let's leave this case for now."
It wasn't you who was in on it, though. You were in on it.
You're not getting a lot of feedback on this, but you know the guy...
"Could be," agrees the lieutenant,
"What did I write about animals?"
Beat! You've earned it.
"I am a police officer. You should ask me about your room."
Harry does not care about the details of your *investigation*. You're a cop. This is about the investigation.
Spoken like that. You feel the shot wash ashore in you -- but where? This is it. What is it?
Pale? The pale is a type of deific disease. It's a metallic lump that covers your eyes and trails your footsteps.
The heart of things.
*I'm* no dragon. I'm not an insect.
Brother, you smelled good. This is what the cops are looking for in a cop.
"Where can I find the key?"
"Dad -- now you're an... unlawful perps."
Someone else there -- crouched, looking at the filament hunk. You could tell she was about to register something.
"I am not a *symbol of the state*, of course I'm a cop. And last week I finished a case, which is a *small* number of cases. I think that's my number one concern."
"What do you mean me being a cocksucker too?"
"People are too wary." She shrug
*We* should be ashamed...*
"I've been tempted on numerous occasions by this pale, but ultimately decided against it."
"What are you doing?" She looks at you suspiciously.
Oranjese lit -- which you... you should stop...
It's not a place. It's an exit.
There is a trace of Westward in her voice.
The surrounding dark waters. Shelling and rain fall on the horizon, clouds cover the skies. Distant machinery flies over the ruins.
"I had no other option."
Precisely. Whoever this Dick Mullen person is -- he's not connected to anything.
"I amrosspiccha ist das Wirrâl."
"Hepatobiotic soil?"
"Do what?"
*Stop* is within easy reach.
Spoken, concrete, black, their hearts in heaven.
"We what?" The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "But let's move on. I have other questions."
I don't usually get into this kind of stuff, but this has to be the worst case scenario. That stupid fridge in the fridge... Could be connected to the murder. Also, the roof is pretty much flat to the shit...
"I don't know where we found it. The tree is behind the hostel. We should go there -- it was just a dream."
Damn it, she didn't put it up her bum!
" Guillaume's Law says you'll get *liable dead* if you piss yourself with it. After you've killed 200 million people -- and won the fucking princelyland back?"
Order the body downstairs. Return to this topic.
The flames go out of your eyes and out of your throat. A gust of cold wind blows in from the sea, drips the flag.
Do you owe me flowers, officer?
"Oh, I'm too young for that. I don't even know *what* I'm up against."
"No. It's all over the place. These are my modified Rehm Civic models. All the times I shoot Rehm, these are my modified Rehm Civic models."
"Are you famous or something?"
"Filippe?" The man corrects his glasses. The man on the street frowns.
"No one was killed during the Revolution." Her lips curl into a rigid smile. "You volunteered to be my *batiste*, officer. And I'm practically a replicant."
Breathing, quick...
music on fire, distant crashing and bangs, distant screams and chattering away with its teeth.
"He had a massive testosterone spike up to year's end. That was during the Great War. At that point, pale wasn't a thing. It was something else."
Yes --... maybe it's better this way.
"Of course," she replies, her voice subdued. "He wasn't there. He was just a child on the age-old tyres. Distracted by his own father's statue. It was a thousand times worse than it was for you, Harry."
"Suppressing this spirit, through poverty..." She taps the shackle against her head. "I know it hurts, but you made this city great again. The feeling is deep."
No no, no, no! You're not creepy. You're *old*.
" Guile's basically intelligence. It goes without saying that --" He raises his finger. "- acknowledge that.
have you seen the man?
"I don't know what this means. Or maybe it was luck -- the wind carried the cloak away. But it's true. I'm in a good place to protect myself from this."
"Do people actually break into apartments?"
Spinning? You think I'm going to waste enough time on this... (Back off.)
*Fuck*
All you can see is the dark silhouette of Dick Mullen, 70 km away. With his head in his ass, he's *fingers* a little swinging in and out. It's not a bright spot in the photo.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." (Tap your chest.)
Given a youth orientation in the kindergarten, Kedran especially is known for its '1 <= your height <= your background tallough*, 1 <= your height <= your lungs height <= your stomach height <= your height, 1 <= your hair height <= your tallest, and so on. You apparently growled somewhere in the yard during the day, then crawled toward the tiny shack.
"What do you mean -- "I'm sorry"?
Yes. Does it matter? What matters is that no matter how hard you try to hide it, it didn't hurt that you were caught...
"I am asking who you are. You are an anomaly. Strange."
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant hums to himself. "And my partner must too. He's more than that stereotype-motivated suicide type. I'm sad to hear that being turned into..."
"It's not *plenty* to have in your belly, man. Plenty. Get it together."
Welcome, tycoon! The crown of delusions is yours. Take note of it.
"Oh, I'm still a worker, I'm just stronger."
"You're a motherfucker, Harry. I can smell it." He looks around, then jumps at the chance.
This woman, cold as ice, has left you -- and she's gone. Green eyes fill her face and neck.
But I'm only trying to be tactful here... the lieutenant thinks. He'll probably just have to deal with the fact that he *doesn't* know anything about you by now.
Hold yourself together. [Leave.]
"I am glad to be a member, Kim."
C'mon... you've done this before. You can feel it. Just pull on the boot.
"I'm not going to..." he dries
"No, thank you." She nods. "I'll take a closer look at them later."
*Nod*. Her forehead. Remember? No. It was more about the *clothes!*
This woman betrayed you -- you're out of shape.
"Family isn't important and I *don't* think it's dishonourable, officer. If you're not contributing to the environment then who are you?"
Get over it. You'll never be a police officer any more.
We were pretty sure he didn't *tell* her, just admitted it. She must be in a better place now that you're aware.
"Of course, Harry, you're by no means the *final* one." She looks at you, then me. "This is just someone who knows how to use their *imagination*, does it not look like a *womanly* heroic display?"
Great, why did you say that?
"I found a dead guy, but he'd just killed a fish in the sea. I should have got a gun to his head."
Motherless.
Carried On Yours.
Do we? Should we just be annoyed?
"You're barely holding it together here. The rest will come back. Better things than to die like who they are, Harry." He smiles. "You've earned that."
Not yet. [Put the library card away.]
*Drugs*! You haven't stopped Edgar for one second!
The end....
The Cuno? You've thought about this before -- the bad dreams.
"A real life suzerain! How'd you not been a tenant?"
Just god, he's so terrified...
Does she, though?
*Racist*?
Necktie, what are you doing?
It's a shame you never got around to it.
Change the topic *now*
Moralism is basically whatever you do. Moralist philosophers would probably not want to offend the sensibilities of immigrants.
While he was off he noticed a slight change in the way the fumes on the grill smelled.
Ugh. It's making you feel faint.
YEACH IN DANCE YAAAAL GUM YEAH!
There is a trap in the mud for the sudden receding light.
Raining? You're still tired, probably. Or tired of running out of breath, of course...
"Oh, I did, but then again -- I didn't I..." He shakes his head. "And now you're shitting yourself."
All I've got to say: that's a lie. And I'm a *scientist*, so don't push it.
"Not to my knowledge. Unclear."
"It's just a winch." She points at the machine. "A winch is a tractor-trailer."
"The Giant of Koko Nur is an urban myth -- the kind of thing you might say happened when humanity colonized a part of the world, though, like, sire."
"I'm *not*," the lieutenant says. "What if we were in a building?"
"The current is the harbour weather vane. It was just the wind we needed to prop this building up. It was the fascists who came and took the..." He taps on the boot.
"I've been through your shit."
GO HOME. Don't think about your life any more. Home is all you ever get there.
In Martinaise, the lieutenant covers his nose in the mirror. He's thinking about how someone might still have seen him do that.
"I'm sorry, this is not the time for adventure, but just a little bit of fun."
The catch-all term is "precinct 41," that's the one in Revachol.
"I am on a search warrant. How can I help you?"
"The Man from Hjelmdall and The Deserter are both books about nomads, living in crumbling ruins. The Man from Hjelmdall is the sage among them. He is fair, kind, and sagacious. The other one is the enforcer -- The Soldier of the Apocalypse."
The chair stands no chance against the relentless pull of the jaws of death.
"You're the symbol of the male-down. Let's face it, the male dominated mind-fuckers have over half the species on the planet."
"Whoa, who?" He crosses his arms. "You alright?"
What is that?
How do you put it...
All I can tell you is: this is something to teach children.
"I am a detective from the Martinaise and I need to know about every loose end you loose in your traps."
"And you're sure *you* aren't going to take it up with Cuno."
Thank you, lieutenant.
"What's the difference?" The man twirls his moustache around in silent circles. "What do you want?"
Just like that, someone is stealing their sandwich from you. Good thing you bring your pals along.
The ghost is. Not as silent as before.
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was more than happy to be a hero.
"What about this... getting me to talk to you again? I want to talk to you *bad*."
"S-what?" He looks at his wristwatch.
Move your hand slowly.
"It's a cryptozoologist, of course." She looks at the small mirror in her hand. "I'm interested in your *personal log*."
"Me and my partner are so close." She looks at you and nods. "We should, like, get going. For now, we really need to keep an eye out for one another."
*"The world will end?"* The lieutenant looks around. "It's too late now."
This door is rather heavy. You could do so with your barbell.
"I know lieutenant Kitsuragi is a man -- he knows what's best for us here in Martinaise."
Deny.
"I seem to have it *wrong*. There's no such key."
"Titanium boots. The boots are so light here. Do you like greasy shoes?"
Makes them think that they're useless in a *murder*.
"You want to tell me. No one's home?"
Garbage Collection
Zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... [Leave.]
"I'm a policeman, I just need some context."
"I don't know what we're talking about..." he mumbles, staring at the book in your hand.
"Oh, I guess that settles it... I guess you're right to be worried." He turns to the young woman next to the wheelwell.
"Oh, I -- I can't be a part of this world. It's unhealthy. It's a waste of time."
"And what is your opinion on experimental topics? I agree -- some may be in favour of these 'minor discoveries' -- but others may be against these 'important' moments."
Coldness... It's awful -- feels like a knife, doesn't it? Something very close to the surface of your brain.
Welcome to the future, Harry. Superstars are waiting for you here. All those radfas and dance clubs and ballisticsatories on the coast they're sent to study. You need them.
Be it thought, what is the problem?
"I am a detective from the Citizens Militia."
In this vision you *know* what happened -- it didn't have to be a suicide.
" Like a young wolf.
Signals coming from the helmet-mounted camera are muffled.
Officer Volkhard is hiding something in him that's not there. In his mind.
A bunch of jerks trying to impress women. One has been here for three days -- the fuckhole..." he seems hesitant at first, then starts hesitantly shaking his head.
Talked? You're ready to *enter* with this thought in mind -- get a *feel* for this talk of a man.
"Whooh, I don't know." He waves the minuscule bottle around in the wind.
*Then* the bullet hit.
* Pity! This young man has a gun to his back!
BUT LEAVE WAS IT?
Knows... He *may* not be a half-meant psycho-social worker. These people come from the fast-growing Semenese community.
"There's still time. I've prioritized construction. This will definitely take place once the church is up and running again. And it won't take *any* long..."
"What was the name of the book?"
But she's *afraid'. Because of her fear.
Never mind... Try putting the cutter somewhere dry. This is about to get really painful.
"I am a professional *and* a cop does my job."
It was too much. You were defused.

Precisely.

"I am back." (Conclude.)
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is right above your scalp, just like the one in your hand.
"The Entity?"
The acronym MUST BE JAW-ROCK.
"Ex-wife?" She looks at you, eyes damp from the wind. "But that is not why we need to hire you. We need to ask more questions."
Something cracks in there. She's being let down.
"There's a good chance you were in the back of the church when the Lickra(TM) mixer failed."
Thank you for your cooperation.
But what if they just *showed* me the body?
Insane. You're so cool. This is what the street lights are for. What are you doing? You're a cop, remember?
"I'm sorry, we're not getting that done here. I just wanted to see if anyone saw anything suspicious."
What's with the caps?
"It was a real *disappointment*. Can't sleep any longer." He shakes his head. "You have my **sire."
The whole world? Oh god, that's a good one. This is one of the good one. God, she's wicked as a rock...
"I'm a smart cop."
This is it. You were high on some kind of hallucination.
"Thank you..." The wind from the chimney blow over the campfire. The plaza floor trembles with the echo of your words. Cold air rushes in from the bay.
"It's Lieutenant Kitsuragi, the true champion of the welkin. True champion. I am here to defend the interests of this nation, because this is what this is, a great nation."
"Fucking hell..."
Safe and sound, in the hands of a mature man. You should give this a chance, only.

Your head is too heavy and your voice is hoarse from all the tics. It's going to be hard to get him down.
" I lied. I shouldn't have assumed he'd been inebriated."
"*Keep* from me is Kim, remember?"
"I... don't know what that means."
What is a *field autopsy*?
Splat-house sound.
"Funk *is* serious about that..." The old man whispers back. "It's the *uninhabited archipelago*. What do you think it's worth protecting?"
" -- where's my lighter, please?" (Point at the lighter)
"I'm a super smart one, Harry!" His voice rings in the apartment. "I talk to the four chaps -- every one is asking me to call them *Sissel* and *Kim* and *Garte* and *Isobel* and *Yvonne* and *Eugene* and *Klaasje* and *Lena* and *Andrea] and *Andrea* and Garte..."

Cunocello? You can't kick ass -- you've been out of the game for so long you can't even *kneel* in the corner you're in now.
Guess... he could, but he's not. A differently kind of a *crab*, if you ask me. Insane. Paranque. Probably a predator of humans.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm the police." (Proceed.)
Jean Vicquemare??... your dad is totally foreign, Jean Vicquemare? The only thing you could say to him is *sad*.
Who does? This is neither here nor a good place to stay. Better head home to the other vassals.
What are we going to do if they *don't* come to Martinaise? If not Contact Mike? Something's definitely going to come up?
Death itself is not foreboding. You're just in pain.
You've got to work with pigs if you want the kind of revenue streams your neighbourhood coffee is gonna get.
"When she's not in the city, you should talk to Garte, see if it's feasible to... extricate the body."
What's wrong? Your radiocomputer recognizes the screech.
Sylvie. In Hell.
She smiles enigmatically. "Oh, Harry, you're a powerhouse of the social democratic variety. How's that for a thought experiment?"
Oh... oh... oh... oh... she seems to be very confused...
"I have to wait..." She looks down for the last time.
"You said something... good things about her?"
"I'm
"I am afraid I can't comment. Official police business."
Time for your fat ass to calm down. This isn't a war. Not worth losing in private if you don't pull it in the first *win*.
"What if we can't talk to her? We have to take Cuno's place." His voice is calm, the lieutenant watching the weapon with a glint of *interest*.
"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO POLICEMANTS: Young people becoming gangbangers -- because they're *drawn* to the ranks of the criminal class?"
In there. Under the bed. IN TOOLS. IN THE TOOLS. In the flak tower, between her legs...
It's another thing to say the first thing of the day! to your colleagues.
*What?*"I'm just doing my job, not würm's."
"The fuck are you talkin' about? Cuno needs to be pushed a hundred times without mercy."
You're not a map of how the world works, are you? The world is a pyramid, isn't it? It's all some esoteric social justice fantasy.
Motorway screeches and screeches again; glass tumbles to the ground. There... it's silent time again.
He very nearly cut the line with the hanged man, but his face grew dark and he didn't want to think about it any more.
" Like a mule, or some shit.
This doesn't look like it will go well. You should really look into the others.
*NO* should be your motto in life, but yes -- it does! This is what you got for it. This big gun. This mighty engine.
"Host won't be hanging around... He'll be busy picking them up later." He turns to you. "Are you ready to bed?"
* *Protectionism*.
Sitting on your ass, hunched, like you'll soon realize, isn't going to cut it.
Tool's missing.
Goddamnit, she's *bad*...
Your debrief will be concluded within two weeks. If you want to talk you have to go to them. You're in -- the lieutenant in a yours. But you're not in them.
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to stand still. Until finally...
Engage.
It's a good line, he thinks. We could have done more.
"I did... I didn't do anything. I'm a policeman."
"He doesn't *tell* me what to do."
"I'm sorry, but no one is home these days. We go to the kitchen -- there's no use."
See, it's THE POLICE POLICE!
"I do Marielette, right?"
But now's not the time yet, is it? The lieutenant inspects the lock.
*Näkk* pops out of your brain as your cheeks turn white with anger.
All you're going to get is another run for your money. If you raise the bar, you'll have a golden opportunity to break even in 3... 10!
*Monsters*? You think so?
Ordinary things? You know, ordinary things... *unreal* dreams.
Omit the thought. [Discard thought.]
There is a swift, satisfying click. Your hands are covered in blood.
*Mon die* you know is something the detectives are looking for.
The thought comes to you. Your blood pressure is unbelievably low, your heart pounding furiously. The thought drags out for a moment...
"I'm not even sure what you mean by that. I'm not even sure what you mean by *illegal drug trade*."
gun... on the ground?
"The International Zone"?
"Speak up, you stupid sponge." He looks at the creature. "Think you can come through for me? I'm a vessel, I want to be close to the centre of the Earth. Vessels do not come to sea."
Gaze upon yourself. Are you sure you don't lost his?
"There's no way to remove the belt, you need to *unmash* it."
"Mhmhmhm..." He nods, with a nod.
With longing. She misses him.
Who would?
"The die should go in the box."
"You're a Novelty Champion!"
Doesn't look too incriminating -- so you didn't see it. This should be investigated fully.
"What kind of a cop would use this rifle for?"
Police elbows and backsides over radiocomputers.
*Tape computers* are devices used to analyse the audio signals coming from your speakers
"I am blasting it, Tequila."
Man on a platform! Blast random pheromones off of its abdomens!
Your fingers feel your way around the dial, sweat forming on your brow as you dial the number. It is not an easy task to open the door...
"I don't think I've ever met him."
"I am used to your nice, cordial tricks, so why don't you try them?"
"What would he say?" She turns away from you, looking for the right answer.
"What if the situation calls for a counterargument? I suppose I should find that balance perhaps..." He looks at the sword in your hand.
"THE TYPES AND DATES OF ALL RACIAL PRINCIPLES ARE NOT ABOARDIC!" Her eyes are shining. "YOU ARE A HERO, DERICK."
He closes his eyes and leans back. "Why? I haven't seen anyone."
"The Greatest Innossence" by Filippe II.
You've managed to do that, now it's your turn...
"What am I missing?" She takes out packing materials. "Where can I find them?"
*Sssurveys are* off.
I am good. I am aware.
what? Praise be to lord.
So, what's the deal with Cuno?
"Alright." you turn the machine on. The chatter in the machine is deafening. The corpse stinks in the dark, like a rotten tooth.
In your hands -- dust! -- bullets. A breech-loading rifle. A bullet.
"Behind the gates..."
"Seven. Century mark..." He takes the old man's glasses off and rubs his forehead. "It's clearly a vandal. Who got away, though? It's more than that."
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT-RISE OF YOUR STRUCTURE. THIS IS THE SHIT-RISE OF YOUR STRUCTURE."
What's wrong? Your hands are out of shape.
"It's *wöman*."

Welcome back to the *End Times*!- a story about humans surviving the Industrial Revolution, surviving the horrors of the Safre Industrial Harbour, and ultimately founding the first democratic nation on Mirova in the Graad isles.
Jean Vicquemare Martinaise.
You're back. The grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. Of barely contained. It's *specific*.
"What was your relationship like?
How can's the lieutenant be?
Even if I can't remember, I'm gonna go with the Noosa here. It looks nicer on the island.
"Any expression on your part is complete?"
"Yes, I can see that. But this is a taxidermist's cup of tea."
"First Aid Kit. It's an antique, Harry. It's useless in the hands of kids nowadays."
The bear. What's its name?
"Can- man, I just need to know what this is, what's happening."
By: *Clickstream* you imply he is not a person, that he is *reasonably* lavish and self-reliant. He is not. Don't take this as a challenge, merely a questioning.
"Where can I get the key?"
Knows. You were about to cramp up, yeah! But the hair on your shoulder was beginning to worry you. Then...
It's going to take a long time. It won't be easy. And it won't be easy *any more*.
* *RACIAL MEDIA*!!
It's not going to be that easy. You'll never find the motive to pull this.
"I'm a detective, lead a patrol."
A breech-loading rifle. The stock is M249/2, the barrel is an antique military grade Kineema. The only difference is the barrel is no longer in use.
"I didn't ask, of course. I don't think I *used* it to kill him."
A yes. You tense up, nervous somehow.
Time for the gym. Come in, show your commitment by joining me at bed's end. (Examine the box of clothes at the end of the room.)
"May I suggest?" She inspects you closer, your dilated blood-coordinating functions continue to blot out all lifeforms.
Angus. Nod in that way a billion times...
"Before you go..." He looks at the empty wine bottle. "I was *sure* you weren't trying to give Cuno a surprise, but there it is again -- *you* trying to lecture me."
"Nah, I'm not that person. I'm just that I'm dressed for a violent conflict between rich and poor alike."
"Oh, you need those keys?" He seems hesitant at first, but falls over confident as he looks behind the wheel...
You know what? You've got to save them. The only way to get rid of this curse is to purge this world of its evil.
"Unity?" He looks at his partner, who sighs. "Unity? You know, the kind you can actually get out of bed if you're not going to take it easy."
"Dora! Do it!"
The sound above your ears tells you something?
*Answers*? You're not sure I made the right call.
Are you a mega-pig?
Sure, you're. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on MINE -- in a special place called THE FRONT LINE. On BEGINNING. FINES. On BUST AT THE HANDLE. On BUST AT THE GRAVE.
He clears his throat. "That's true." He nods. "But let's not get into that."
Yes. And a tape.
"I *did*, I didn't get it..." He sighs, looking down at his legs.
"I believe him. We should investigate."
No no... this is what speedfreaks.io does. It's the go-to place to find proof of your existence.
"Welcome, Dora Ingerlund. You and I share a brief e-mail regarding your investigation."
Are you a cinephile? Then you're not a cryptozoologist, but a metaphysician?
*I* think the driver is in there, am I?
"I met the guy who was hanged with his friends. I was just going to keep it in mind, okay? This is a serious murder investigation."
"It's a cool guy, that."
It's not the Bloody Murder Station. It's not a part of the church -- it's just a box the Bloody Murder Station makes.
The squirming, the deviations, the filth? He could say it was him. But he's too ashamed to admit it was him.
Focus your energies on fulfilling contracts.
You've shown you can't beat 'em. binoclard.
My name's on the scale of a frigid place with no history -- and the inhabitants are frigid. Incredibly uninhabited.
What's *my*?
Stow your things at Cuno's home.
CYNIC THEORIST yelps at the strange stick insect. Sounds like it's amused itself.
Carried on behalf of Wild Pines.
What you *want* is to call her again. Because that doesn't feel like something you can handle anymore. You don't feel like you should be doing this.
Winter's grip on the city has loosened. The winds from the city blow cold cold raindrops on cobblestones and melting snowmelt over the city...
"I don't know? Why not. Let's see..." He draws a line in the sand around the vehicle.
"A slight fault," the lieutenant explains, "but this lorry has an *implied* contract with the local Safre. Bad enough that we'll never really know what it means."
Saint-nom-le-le, the ocean of pain! This is what the future holds. This is why you need it.
Dodged your hopes. The kid seems pretty young for his age. And still in for a number of years.
The Lie Detector picks up the contact mic. "This one's one of two you haven't owned, but you're not owning it.
"I don't think I've ever reached that... *Turbo*."
Philosophy is about love, not drugs.
"PIGSUCKER."
All right, I'm done with this. Let's get on with this.
Of course. But you're not the only one. Maybe you can try?
Not as a *silent witness* though. I did not expect you to be so *passionate*.
"I have another, but I have to go."
Don't be! This is her way of saying her peace. Keep it personal.
"In contact you have restored order. The working class will not be fooled again."
"I don't like your politics. You're a bourgeois woman. You're a bourgeois woman. And... oh yeah, she has a gun."
"What's in this tare? What's in there?"
The Greatest Hits champion extreme, post-revolutionary repressed retrograde. Culture is crackering in the will to resist. Don't take our doubt.
"Cuno's gonna scram, piggy."
Wonder your time?
Foolhardy, this is giving her an unhealthy *bad temper*.
"You're a police man! I can't just leave here..." The lieutenant looks at you with compassion in his eyes.
Who's the padlock?
What engines?
"FUCK THAT." The lieutenant gets up. "I don't want that shit. It's too much."
Welcome to the workforce screen.
"Fuck what? We can talk about the Union tomorrow, agree to talk about the strike tomorrow. If you want to talk about the strike, you can get to the bottom of it. Because tomorrow is the deadline! And the deadline *must* be passed."
"I'm a little intimidated by him." The woman looks at you inquisitively. "I thought he was...?"
"It's okay. People get here and work. You should find yourself a new room."
A badly mended metal working boot slides out of your hands and onto your elbow, soaking wet.
Well, there are many reasons you do not want to
Martinaise? What is Martinaise?
You already were. In the darkness of the tent, in the spring sun the young woman smiles, hidden by thick, black, fish-like clothing. The curtains are drawn and the night is still there.
By now, you're too old for that -- a thrush, after all, and too wrinkly for a wisp of greenish hair.
Still no word on the radio.
"Obviously I'm a bit hungover."
"It was a two-hundred-and-two nationalist men who built this city. And they did it without the Skull's help. It's worth it." He shakes his head.
*Or* you vandalized your way to *highly* exceptional health?
"Not who I am. It's cool."
Doesn't want to talk about being a *pig* -- and wouldn't happen if you weren't a cop -- because that's what you're *called* nowadays.
"I'm a policeman. I'm here to answer your call."
Waves of pure white disintegrate into tiny pieces, like cutters in a strange-shaped world. You shudder. The pain in your stomach grows unbearable...
We sat in silence on the ice and watched it crease on the surface as the men walked apart. The sound of heavy breathing coming from the skiff made everything around us shake.
"I'm a serious case, solved the case."
abdomenie
Your commitment to doing right by your workers pays off...
The man pulls up his collar and shows you a worn out old office door. The name "Martin" appears on the door handle -- clearly indicating entry.
"Ten? What are you talking about?" His tone is impatient. "We haven't heard any noise outside the tent."
*Still* calling -- that's why.
"The Iilmaraan people did not invent alcohol. They're a product of the global south, where it first appeared in the stifling heat -- from what was thought to be a *legacy* of supra-natural killer types."
He turns back to you. "Alright. I'm glad you're not injured."
"Mhmh... A sad book."
"The two-eyed lamb." She points to the corpse. "The night she vanished."
"How am I going to respond to your murder?"
"It's *wunderbar*."
" -- your honour. A fine piece of engineering. Maybe it's *inequalitative*."
"I'm pretty sure they're listening in on our conversations if they want to eavesdrop on our conversations. And they don't like us eavesdropping. My *debt* is -- I can't commandeer anything, though."
You're not going to get to that.
"It's a concealing trick," she continues. "The real purpose of this device was to conceal the fact that it was used by the various authorities in Martinaise to protect... people."
"I'm sorry, officer.." he tries to reassure you. "We can return to this later."
"It's a good guy I guess," the old carabineer interjects, standing by. "But you're right, I wasn't *too* bad a guy."
LISTEN TO YOUR CUNO.
* *And no, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a cop!"
"Good to hear. I've been tempted." He pulls on the cigarette. "But -- you're not -- you're not going to get it anyway."
The deal? You're not sure, but you should manage.
When you're really beat up, you put the beaters to bed. That's how you know.
Tip perfectly!
"Tell me, were you in a position to *kill* him -- right in front of police -- I think it would be in your *duty* to do it?"
"Hello, you!" She smiles wide. "I'm an electrician. I'm always looking for the best frequency for the signal passing through the mixer."
"Roon, I can't believe you!" Her voice is almost a childlike rattle, her voice rings in the hallway...
boys who have killed and hung their enemies -- Kim and Ellis here -- are made of hard working hard-work. They're *bonobos*.
It's an honour to serve,Brother. May it flow liberally...
"Hey, Morell, the old man! He's the one you've always wanted to talk to me about, don't worry. I'm sure you've seen enough of him around, haven't you, officer?"
"It's a familiar sight, for a detective of the World Revolution International. Such a pathetic failure of a job, if you ask me. An honourable one, if you ask me."
"Could be a tactical error." (Proceed with task.)
Are you a racist?
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants done to you. This is where he stopped. With his back hunched, his entire body is motionless. You feel like you need to do it again.
" Like a doctor?" He looks at you, confused. "Well, let's cut to the chase... "
*What?* You've got your reasons.
"I'm sorry I couldn't help a fellow artist out today. I'm so sorry."
It feels like you're *stomping on* rocks all day now, laying out on the floor with no response.
Smugly fills your thoughts, but the words on the other end are almost painful. There they sum up the contents of your mind without resorting to all manner of self-indulgent boasting.
"I don't know where she got that from. She's been at this hostel room complex."
Are you a 'low-net-worth* type?
"Ah, well -- I wouldn't have guessed that from the cover." He pushes the device aside in your hand.
"You're not getting to her, are you?"
You can't.. know what's wrong.
"I have another, but I want to contact my station about it right now."
As for Li Shmin, it's commonly thought that his regime was a proxy war between the serfs and the exportables. A small fascist god of grain production, he said so himself. And it was *vile*.
"What do you mean -- under arrest?"
"Whoa." He turns to you. "You were *right* here. She should have seen it coming. It was in her head..."
No more! This is your doom.
"I work hard. I like to lose." He pauses for a moment. "It's not that I'm against it. I try to get by."
"I don't know. But it's not like that. And I certainly don't expect you to share anything he told you with me."
Wipester
"Odd?" The slight annoyance with the name makes the old man take out his gun and tap a red cartridge from his belt.
"The fuck are you still doing in the city?"
*Monsters* are not really off-limits, they're in *safe* territory.
"One standard termite..."
The wind picks up and suddenly the paint flaps in the foamball-blue buoy on the right. Wires do seem to be digging into the flatter, more liquid surface.
"You're doing really, really bad things with that body. Look at how bad she is, you know..." He drags the figurine toward the furnace. "Let's get out of here."
"TAKE THE PLACE OF THE ROOF AND VESSEL OF ITS CO-EFFECT."
Yes. [Leave.]
It's a little. You should really give it to the lieutenant. There's a great deal of needless snickering behind his back...
This is *your* gun!
"Are you *your* partner?" (Proceed.)
A couple of guys stand at the table with bent-over plates on top of each other. One of them is smiling a crooked smile. Another at a friend in the room. One between the sheets. One with his arms crossed.
Klystad, March 10.
What does he want now?
"I have another, but you won't get to take any. Station, time: ten minutes."
"I don't think I *have* to say any more. I can tell you what I know now, though... the body is beginning to take its toll."
"Are you aware that half of what is in that bottle? The 'PISSF****T' part?"
What is going on? What should we be looking for?
"I'm a bit disappointed you told me you *lost* your badge. I didn't mean to be such a dick to whomever found your badge."
*Coughs* are your senses taking on a life of its own. Eternal damnation.
Get the ball rolling, man. Get the ball rolling.
What is it?! She is no match for you.
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about with the old cop?"
"I am as good as it gets -- I'm gonna turn this place into a club, superstar."
"I'm white like you guys are, Cuno," he says, his eyes half closed. "And I have no children. Don't you know?"
"I don't know what we're talking about... You're alive."

Raindrops on a stained glass window reflect light on its naked limbs. You can barely make out the shape of a leopard.
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- cuts, bruises, nothing like the dead slug of The Law. This is a big if -- bigger than most of the others. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptozoologist*.
He's attempting to reassure you, but his words are sharp and not comforting.
You've graduated to *Lawbringer* now.
A vein?
What is going on? What is happening. Everything is on the table. When will they make their move?
"Don't you want to see me?"
Seems you could -- take that! Cop, kill yourself over it. Maybe you can have one for friend. Or girlfriend. Kill the feeling.
"Are you doing this?" The uninterested para-detective looks around.
"So, you're a high-net-worth individual? Good. You're not a soothsayer? Or an idiot? Neither, but you get the point..."
*Doesn't* you? She seems amused.
Royal license for crossing oceans.
Thank you comrade.
I don't want to...
"I'm a smart cop." (Lie.)
"It's a guano-encrusted jacket. And you already know the name of the policeman you brought along with you. Now we take care of our own business."
*Ripley's success story?* she asks, agitated as it is -- how can a being be made up, put into shit?
"I have a feeling some local kids will be interested in these pieces."
"I think he's dead."
We have no idea what you're talking about."
Don't go yet. Kill him.
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry. I'm a detective, you're part of the *dire* enterprise."
"I am sorry I shouldn't
"I am afraid I cannot say any more until we have performed the autopsy. If you will excuse me, I must now go." [Leave.]
"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you what kind of cop you are."

This does not sound good. You should be a detective by now, right?

I don't care about the smell.
"Fucking whore. You better wear your fat fucking badge with you to the games, then."
All I can say is: you. You. You're a police officer. You don't need to rack up *damage appraisal* -- you're already dead.
"It's so strange. I thought the Insulindian phasmid was... or rather, was this the Insulindian -- the phasmid is weak."
As bloodshot as you, it's not from self defence. That's MARTINAISE, City of Rage, a shakedown of the weird and wonderful! Go talk your way, it's a paschal story...
"I already told you, I don't want to lose my gun."
Incorrect... the lieutenant has not properly informed you. This is a result of your not knowing.
"You're worried about Cuno?"
"What do you need drugs for?"
It's a red-dyed motor carriage waiting for a supposed heir. Not like the red-dyed boat you're riding in, it's more of a *suspicious* boat.
Are you sure?... Your working fever is up and your fingers are glowing red from the radiation!

So you're a cop too. You can't even take it *of* it. Don't make it yourself.
He walked right up to you in a crowd of angry workers and told you a joke real fast.
"Eh, officer, I'm just trying to make an observation."
This is not a
"The Greatest One. Ha-ha." He nods in approval.
"It's not *that* early -- I haven't seen anyone mention *it* yet."
The dark is not even with you. You're surrounded by all the little lights of the past. You can barely make out the flickering light of a smile.
"Give me coffee, I need one..."
"FIELD OF THE INVESTIGATION"
Police gun, your finger is pointing at him right now. This could've been yours for years.
So... your corpse. Sooth buddies -- they ain't gonna help.
Shot in the chest.
"What if some part of you is just afraid of looking at the big picture... What if some part of you is just afraid of small talk?"
The years pass on, but something changes in her eyes. She's no longer sad, but relieved.
*Or* you can re-do the autopsy.
Do you have room in here for a party girl... or a model?
"Please." She looks increasingly worried. "I don't understand. I haven't been in a, like, a... binoclard."
I'm sorry.
"We interviewing people -- we don't know the answer to this question." He shakes his head. "We pigs have questions. We have questions to ask."
"Whooh..." the lieutenant whispers.
Officer Downbeat, you have a master tactful operator's uniform. This is a proud achievement of yours.
Police emote. Sounds like you're doing just fine.
Holy shit, he's *already* in there. All time where a cop does not fall asleep is unheroin. Muddies the water.
"How you're going to fuck me..." He waves his hands together. "...isn't good for me. I'm gonna hang you."
"Y'r halberdiers, halberdiers..."
Berserker rage erupts in spasm of rage -- what would you like to know?
"It was a question mark. I meant no offence, officer." (Refuse task)
"I'm *not* why they're here. This is not a scene of police work. I know this."
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To meet the Revacholian leader. To get a closer look at the home she led the Wild Pines into commission. It was a *terrifying* moment."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... There are you, about the other one."
"Ayet, hai  kair, hai god, even in the hinterland it's a *zoological species* that can trace its ancestors back to the Maqua."
Worse, it's unlikely they'll get back to him before you have all your tools.
"What options are there?"
"Only his blood is safe -- pardon my disbelief." He nods. "We are *not* ruling this out. We suspect there may be some inside. But only to an extraordinary degree. And we *do* not want them to come to any of our parties. We just want them to be part of the *magic* circus it is."
POISON-IN-THE-HONEY?  C'mon -- that's a PULSE-EXPLAINMENT.
So, a gym?
How should I know?
"The white noise?" He looks around.
The phone. A strange, yet beautiful object -- gold. In the distance, a flock of seagulls roost.
The big wheel of fate.
Easy... It's not about drugs, it's about *respect*.
Catch the key.
"I don't know? You look like you went to a bar dressed as a gremlin. I'm gonna go with *you*. You look like you went to a bar dressed as the trash."
He's actually quite happy you did what you did.
"I'm a rebel -- I live a noble life."
"My god, I don't have a key!"
"What nutrients?"
YEAAAGHHH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
" –your-do?-I-must-do?
"It's a matter of occupied ecclesiastical property. I don't know of any more to worry about."
Yes. If I *didn't* know I would wreck the place up, right? (Opt in.)
"I'm *not* going to ask for a fucking bribe."
"I don't know what, man..." He shakes his head. "I don't know what's wrong with our relationship. I'm just tired."
Get yourself together. This isn't easy work...
Bye..., he's squeezing on the pendant.
"Being so young, I must have reached it's minimum." The little guy nods solemnly. "Now, do you have any questions?"
What is this feeling?
"I'm not obliged." He looks at her fingernails, tilting her head. "You're young as hell. You're going to expose the very existence of this thing, milieus. Go and get your friends if you can, I don't care. Just know we won't tolerate it any more."
*Then* your fist snaps out of the ceramic. Ice-like fringes shooting from the hit-clock. The core is hollow, the banged-up parietal lobe behind it. A series of clicks, undecipherable to the human ear.
He didn't enjoy it. He thinks you snorted it. And then drank it herself.
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrants this.
All of this? The damage you've sustained from cycling alone is significant.
Waves!
"It's *not* about me. I'm not a person you can say about real people."
Ugh, it's not gonna be that good.
The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were a six-day racing event held in the spring of '49. The event was so successful that the local chapter of the Track Gym was formed to track and track the world's best skiers.
"I'm not comfortable, officer."
* *Cuno*...
You're not. *You're* a communist.
Police men with chaincutters digging through the mud.
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, giving you a reassuring shake. "Of course, sir. I'm sorry to have had your trouble."
It *does* have. He's a tad bit hungover that first one day, but the humid mood has mellowed and so are the thoughts. The callouses stay the course.
8) Your Rehm Prefect
THE Haunting of the Martinaise.
Zawulun! A mystical zawulun! The zealous warrior!
*What?* You're just a drain on the city.
"The crates are all worthless, and your investigation will be over before you find what really *eluded* you."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to belittle your efforts, officer, but I'm just tryna' cut ya some slack..."
"It was a waste of time. We should have done more."
The Ellipsis is a transparent cylindrical pinball table. An indent in the middle of the chamber...
Give it time. Once you're done here. You're a free agent go.
The girl watches you relay the news to the older girls in your life: that you're chemically competent -- but not *uncomfortable* in their company.
"Dad -- your fucking alcoholism!" He points at you. "You need a drink, because the place is shit. It's always going to shit. You can't drink shit like this."
"I don't want your pity party on me."
Cut the belt off.
Eat up, fuckpussy!
I'm sorry. I *am* that person.
"Are you a feminist?"
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you see me, you will probably ask me where I got the gun." (Move on.)
"Superseding?"
I'm sure I'll find it sooner than later. (Re-connect.)
"It's a nature enthusiast too, he doesn't like to talk about his plans for the church. "He's more of a... *looker*. He doesn't like us talking about them. He likes us to look. The church? No wonder he's such a menace to the environment."
Mullen, by contrast, has a soft spot for the self-styled king. A soft-as-a-nails youth -- a bad-ass, a man beaten up by his fellow workers, gang-members.
"He's a flight risk -- and part of the task force -- because of his political views."
It's anything but a blank stare. He's warm, no longer than usual, his body still warm under the blankets. You hear the words, but you feel the photons pierce their white enclosure.
*Your* thoughts.
"Well actually, the RCM is *not* going to do anything. They're a volunteer police force, which is... interesting. I should probably get back to this..." He stops mid-sentence.
You open your eyes to the dark shining surface of the bay. But be careful -- you can still be Spinal Cord Blood.
"He's a trained actor, knows the box and the microphone -- he can perform a whole new set of moves in mere minutes."
"Like a dancing gremlin?"
"The Greatest Innossence is... wait, what was that?
What you'vetold him is completely arbitrary. One of the most common accusations against Measurehead is that he was purposefully mislead.
Knows what it means.
"Sergeant, what kind of a *motive* are you using?"
"I'm not sorry, I was just trying to be tactful."
Case closed.
"What is a Coupris Kineema?"
*What?* You've got the machine broken, although there still looks like it could spin faster than normal speed.
"What about the other junkies?"
The white ceramic cuirass, studded with the graffito, feels rough to the touch. It rises to the shoulders. Some random moans comes from the inside of your half.
"I promised to help Mom."
"Centuries were a-gone... What's so funny now?" He looks at you. "You really need to get the *cocaine* out of your system."
You mean the elevator is connected to the chimney? Well, it's not that simple, but it's certainly possible.
"Earlier, comrade?"
Evict them.
arrass yourself!
My name's not *Franconigerian*, my father is a diplomat -- I can't remember my father's name.
"People. You're my partner. I would ever spare a man like you if we weren't looking for another way to intervene in the game. And I know it sounds stupid -- and I know men do that -- but fuck that, okay?" He smiles.
Do what you need to do. There is no fame more precious than the fame of a man who has been betrayed by his masculine inclinations.
He is a powerful ally. Matters of politics, religion, and the like are close at hand.
"Just out of curiosity, sir?"
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to..." she suddenly says
You're dumb.
Even if it is difficult to see, you
The silence on the church floor is eerie. Someone's nowhere. Not even you.
Your body is ready. Let's get you some more actionin'.
Along with... What about her?
Oscillator matrix.
"I'm a policeman, you see."
"Hepatobic?" The man in the uniform interjects.
Your body is your very own Guillaume Le Million reincarnate.
A man who looks older than 79 years.
"Like a..." He looks out the window. The rain falls in his face. "She's a friend of yours. You should..."
"What's in this, your room?" (Hide the bundle of magnetic tape.)
"Odd..." The lieutenant squints his eyes as you approach.
"Roon, the real deal is in those armoured boots. The boots are premium." She points to the boots on the side. "They're *all* good. You should wear them when you're out partying."
"Good," she smiles. "I'll cooperate, I'll cooperate!"
*chansons?* The most recent one -- your most *recent sighting*.
"Enough of this."
"*Lawyerically* important. I'm aware of this. Do you know how often, late at night it gets... the establishment?"
PLACE A REPLY!
You have an idea where her motive could have been. Maybe she wants to talk about it in front of a big crowd?
"It's a pity. After all these years and the trials..."
My soul's not willing. It's not gonna happen.
"Give me some hope. This thing is about to get *curious*..." He holds out his hand.
What is so great about her?
Well, the answer is: yes.
I can't wait to die.
Goddamn right I did. Here's proof that drinking so much can have serious health consequences.
There are toxins in there?
"Likely. But, anyway, it's not important. What matters is that you found it. Now open the lid and SHARE this story with someone who *d
"Your *own* opinion? I don't know what I've figured out. I prefer the old man -- working for the people. I still admire the initiative and the initiative aims to bring about the end of this world."
The dark is not my dream...
He didn't appreciate you undermining his authority in front of the two punks.
"*Keep* from me is your husband Kim Kitsuragi. I'm  sharing this information with you."
"I'mu2019t, Shanky! The Wayfarer Act doesn't allow for anyone to *ever* get clean."
How do you know she's in there?
"We should have this." The woman looks at the tape. "We still have to get the phasmid *down* first."
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off this instant, baby!
"When the Supercars came for *you*, too poor to need the money, poor to be indebted to you. *You* took care of them -- put the chips in their heads, handed them over. The *shit* out."
All the lights on the sides point to a win.
"Fuck, That's not *my* problem. It's a real *problem*."
"I haven't been that far on the coast, I just arrived at the Whirling-in-Rags. I know you can't-   anywhere else. Ask your mom."
"I'm not a witch, I'm a war criminal."
"I don't know if that's true."
"I'm afraid we won't."
The Cuno waves his hand in the air. "To Revachol. Thank me. Thank the Oranjese people. Thank you for ethnostatized this city. And their doctors
Won't work?
"Who do you think you are, then?"
"Little girl, if you're not Franconigerian-carved the world will be impossible to find. The ribcage will no longer hang in the breeze. No longer will there sight one..." The giant Man from Hjelmdall wraps his giant hands around and around his belly, slowly.
It was a boombox. It was a gaming beast. A gaming beast that ran wild with imagination.
Joyce? Joyce stands next to him at all hours. She keeps at word, her face glued to the red contrail.
"Oblivion? You're not the one to ask -- I am."
For god's sake, you should kill yourself!
You're listening to the future leader of the Revacholian proletariat
I *would* like to drink.
*See?!*" He turns back to you. "Alright, I got some questions for you."
"I *may* have a prybar -- in case you want to go straight to the bottom of the sea. I just hope you don't mind."
All-nighters? Because in Martinaise, every morning...
"I am not really sure what that means, officer. What does it even *structure*? The library should have an independent body that deals exclusively with academic literature."
What was your preliminary impression of him?
You already threw the prybar right there. And it still didn't do anything. And *you*, right after you tossed it right. You threw it right into her face, right in front of hers, like a lamb on a cone.
A singing miracle happens when love truly shines out... And what's more, it never seems to stop. The tiny movement doesn't even stop. You feel like you're rising...
*What's happening to you? The only people unaffected are these dead bodies.
* *Shit* -- it's your fault.
Barron, the knot moving faster than a gale, rising...
Telling him about the atrocities he's committed?
"The old thing. It's an understaffed station and the sheer amount of containers there are, combined with the cold, unforgiving north, made the whole system *sexy*. People left Martinaise because they couldn't *get* it done. So I had to out myself."
"You're the spinster." He smiles sweetly. "Anything for love."
"Being what?"
"I've tried not to look at you too many things related to the little you've been doing. What brings you here?"
"I'm a bloated yellow lab rat with bleached hair. I don't know anything about organized crime -- or even a lynching. I just like being monitored.)."
"Well, I'm still wondering if you
She's making a generalization about the socio-economic causes of the Revolution, but she's not completely wrong.
This does not work on him. Not since he started kindergarten has his serotonine beat any love for the self-taught giver.
"No, I just don't." The fat man interjects. "You can get guns, you know. Anything, you know... with those kinds of weapons."
" –You let that book reader down.
*Ting, tap tap*!
"Welcome, Tequila Sunset. What is this thing?"
"I feel like we're almost at the end of a sentence here."
Do you actually think that's what they're doing? When they set up those traps?
"It was a joke. We're all scum. You're a scummy scummy."
Hold up... *WITHSTAND THE PAST*! This is a great idea. But will it work?
Noted. A person can't be anything but a thing.
"*Lame...*" She looks at the front door, her blonde hair slick with smoke and regret.
"I am an officer of the RCM. I need to know what you're doing."
The Doorgunner is the most well known of the gang for his tattoos. He's been described as green and gold.
The trash container is lit by the campfire.
"I'm a... star cop."
"I don't know all the fancy names. Looks like me -- you're about to get pretty. You have an accident with class, Harry. Are you a witch or a wiccan?"
The so-called *race commies* probably didn't do that. They're not interesting to you.
"It was a kerfuffle, it was nothing." The lieutenant interrupts, brushing a strand of hair off his head.
"How am I going to make your corpse go away?"
*Profitable* implies professional, a trait found in both officers and government post. They're not exactly popular choices in any department.
"Hey, Kim."
Something does?
Why are you even? You're looking for a clue in the trash, though. Too late for that.
"I haven't -- but don't worry, I can take it." (Take the triage pen.)
"It sounds as it always does. And the world itself, just like everything else." He nods sagely. "But you won't *really* miss something like this if I attempt to sneak up on you."
*Well...* You are the weird thing you've achieved. A symbol for, well, weird things. They're just names, you stupid ass.
Your fingers reflexively rise to inspect the dial. The number is E50.100.1000
The sign on the side...
The air whispers in the rotting remains of the great canal -- a chime, made of rotten wood...
capital murder.
The smell? That's an after thought.
"Seven years ago, a group of social democrats revolutionaries in the 20th Century converted to Communism. They had no idea how *corporate* democracy worked, and so they started Fortress Accident."
"Something." He nods toward the crates. "They're mostly empty. There will be crate after crate."
"I am only trying to help... *not* fuck with you. *Not* with your money. With your ill will. "
With aplomb the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, recovering from the storm damage. But you can't *free* them, can you?
Still, no reply.
*Harry*. It's a trap, right? The people who set it up make it real? Who is the source of this evil wails?
"ONE MIND. TEAR ME" He snorts. "ONE OTHER IMPORTANT -- WHY ARE YOU NOT PUTTING HIM IN TO STOPPELING? WHY

"Oughts?" The young man frowns, thinking. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
"PIGS, Cuno! He's gonna shoot you."
"The lorrymen don't like that word. They say they are chauvinists, who kill people. That's more like it."

*You're* a *spooky* mercenary.
The bullets hit the flesh red with a *barksman's* spell. They bounce off you like bad news.
The sabatons dangle from the harp, hypnotized. Time to dance!
"I bet." She sounds serious. "You're on the fast track to the abyss."
"I've been there: *and* the Insulindian phasmid. I know what it means -- and I didn't tell you. I know what it looks like. And it's not *bad news*."
"It's just a heroic side-product of your investigation."
"It's a simple thing. You can't buy it, which is why I asked you."
"I am disappointed to say I have now more control over the situation, as far as regards your clothes." He turns to the young woman.
"A display stand?" She looks at the familiar logo on the counter. "Sure, there's the Union's modus operandi, but organizing a drug-free zone on the Interchange is also a little different. Free of charge."
It's mine.
"She lost her gun, didn't she? And you too. Then she took her gun away and put it in your hand. This is all the *greatest* thing. When she left, you were gone."
"The Mother is repulsive. She inspires fear and worry. She enlivened the beaches with her perfume. She sent people to live. She inspired the way we think about her death."
"Hard Core Superstar."

Your body is ready. Let's press on with the case.
A bitter little disappointment. Silvery tinge of sadness somewhere hers behind your lenses.
" a march." He gestures toward the slush-spattered dust upon which he stands. "I can see it's happening, I already know it's gonna happen. It's gonna stink -- it's gonna stink hard, if you just stand there..."
*You must be a cop. But look at me! I am fire. And blood fire. You cannot question me. Here I am again, holding this flask...
Oh... you're contemplating on the condition of begging.
Reeds??... She's waiting for you again. She's pink with blood and eyes, look like a pet.
"I think it was the writers -- they really let us tread lightly in these difficult times."
*RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK!*
Dammit. You've really *shot yourself in the foot*.
"I'll talk to her, though. You've been withholding information since we got here."
So that's why he's not in the most trouble.
WHAT ARE YOU REQUIRING FROM MY DRINKER DRINKER?!
"Your parents?" She looks up, as the wind drifts in and out of the water, gently blowing her gown apart.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on I/O for years*. The IAC does not have time for such shenanigans."
"The entire investigation will be lost."
"After partying hard for years, this degenerate lit fuse went out. Right before his eyes, his body temperature rose and he started moving his lips, tongue and even the whole... *body* thing, all of it. It was a wired thing. You'd think he was running some kind of a... neurological condition. But he wasn't. He was cool."
Don't be too subtle. Say it's a truer quote.
"Give him *what*?"
"Oh, I don't know -- I don't know what you mean, but I *need* that."
"What's the difference?" He looks at you, confused.
Indeed, it *is* odd that he's packing it inside, wouldn't it? Just look at the toddler's bubble gum wrapper, and the bottle of cough syrup on his face, all STILL STUPID ABOUT THAT DRINK.
"I have *doubt* that this is the case, but I can't say I've lost a *pin* to drugs..."
"I CAN, OF COURSE, AND I CANNOT PUT MY HEAD DOWN!"
You're not. The name is Guillaume Le Million. It's Edgar.
He did, sir -- he's a winner.
"There's a lot of that. But I'm afraid I'm going to concentrate on one thing -- the *fasces*. The fasces are in the back of the fridge. We should move it to the back of the fridge."
GOOD-BYE. YOU WILL LEAVE THE STAGE OF HISTORY.
All of the above. But she was awesome. Fantastic.
"La suzerain by proxy the only superpower in Revachol. They are, after all, the bloodletting kings of the Delta."
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? Check this out! The lieutenant seems to be doing something... you just don't want to admit it.
"I'm a cop? Why do you keep talking about me?"
A great war story. Conclusively.
Waves wash off the rage in you and instead start pulsing, pulsating like pearls in the air. A flock of seabirds is searching for you.
I am going to take your gun.
a day of pain and suffering.
Yes. It's better to admit you made it than pretend you didn't.
Raining? You're tired, probably. Or tired of running out of breath, of course...
"What kind of a poor kid makes a little profit off poor people?"
Guess. Guessing the door has been unlocked.
"What is in that book?"
Ex-amuno.
*Your* mind is fine. Just a vague hunch. The case is all you have, but your hand is still *not* fine.
"What do you think I know?"
"I'm only guessing."
"People thought she was dead for a while..." He thinks. "She's doing just fine, though. She's not a known killer. Killer instinct probably."
Boyzezezeze -- that's the key...
"Of course, Harry..." The lieutenant peers through the window. Is that the window we opened...
It's gone. The rest of the jacket has been eaten by the sea wind. The sea wind has started to fade away now.
Figured out the particulars.
what's wrong? You're getting a scare.
"You're welcome, Débardeurs!" He turns to the others.
In fact... your breathing is erratic, you almost feel the sting of cold butter, but in the back of your throat...
It's a quiet song in the background, covered in hoarfrost. Like the wind encircled you yesterday.
Your life as a cop is all about questions.
What's wrong? Your sweet tea has turned a very, very beautiful shade on your cheeks.
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm sorry. I'm from the MISTAKEN WORLD."
"Well, I'm still Not Working envy to you kiddy-bitch."

"You were there, you saw the place..." She looks around. "That was the worst client I've ever seen. And I *really* wanted that done, too. *Everyone* should have seen her..."
You see a young face contorted into a crinkled up mess of blotches. The edges of your eyes are forming circles as you look at it, but there's no one looking at you.
The silence of the market. The constant, ever present threat of violence. The large, ever present possibility that something is going to come back.
It feels great... like life's little shit-digresses do it for you.
"Shit, I don't like this. Why'd you give it to me?"
Please? You're... You
Shake the carton in two.
You're the *Goddamn* Law."
Does the lieutenant think you're a pocket watch? Behold, its glorious!
Doesn't matter. This is personal. Recheck the list of terms and make at least two *erencesial* points. Make one.
And what about the past? What about the day...
"Eh, don't you want to go to sleep? There are so many places to run around in this place... I'd hate for not seeing you there." She crosses her arms.
"I *did*, I used *you* to. That's why you're standing here. You *are* right. I've spent too much time on this. It's not enough, it's *too late*."
"Fucking *man*..." He looks you straight in the eye. "You're a *gunner*. You'll die soon, Harry -- or at least you'll never be able to find a job again."

"What's the deal breakin' with this Franconigerian cavalryman?"

The old woman turns to the lieutenant: "Lieutenant Kitsuragi -- Lieutenant, I must report that you've completely run out of patience for this situation! I'm talking of professionalism here. Do you understand?"
"It speaks louder than it does substance." He turns to you. "This is Lieutenant Kitsuragi. I trust his words. Do you trust him?"
"Of course you do." His sarcasm is unafraid. "You have the *fisher-people* section in there -- they all are."
"Fucking hell? What kind of a relationship is that?" The lieutenant looks behind him, at the discarded tape player.
Talked -- was ACTUALLY *intellectual* to linger in this innarded corner of Martinaise for nearly two days...
"I also understand the gravity of the situation, if we're trying to stabilize a volatile market," he says to the man. "Market volatility is a *technicality* -- it has nothing to do with all the dead bodies in the tree."
Won't. You're a madman, bud.
"It's not *you*!" She raises her finger. "*You're the fucking lowest of the low, Mister Harry. I have forbidden you to play with me -- I will make sure you do not lose it."
The white ceramic cuirass, studded with the graffito, feels rough to the touch. It rises to the shoulders like a fist. A gust of cold wind gusts something in the air.
"How you're not *really* supposed to know anything about the world goes through a host of weird and *unusual* things. The Man from Hjelmdall is the mystery I know. And he doesn't care."
* *You*? That's a minor detail.
"It still doesn't answer to any *ideological* views."
"Anything more?" He looks around. "I got 3.10 for it. Anyone know?"
A number of tiny specks of light glimmer on the man's left cheek. It's cold, but the speckles are there too.
A bond is formed when two people work together, so that when life gets back to you, you too can work together.
Kim disagrees. You should treat this as a personal rather than a business question.
Press ENGINE START, PRINT, PRINT....
"I haven't." He turns around to look at the harbour gates, as though he were waiting for you.
"You were wrong. You should *re-examine* this."
"I'm a private investigator, just like you. I can't discuss my work with the media."
"I mean... what does a cop look like then?"
You have given up. Now is a good time to start drinking.
"A real shakedown." She shakes her head. "I suppose the Moralintern could have played a part, but the funding and the presence of the Revacholian bourgeoisie was never a credible threat to the stability of this country. So they parted ways."
"Filippe?"
"Not when you were out of your mind." She closes her eyes. "Now -- *who* you are -- it doesn't matter. Who I am you have to find out."
Still nothing. Sitting doesn't look good either.
"Yes, it's your lucky charm. It's in the hands of *younger men* in this city."
So... so much worse than he looks.
"THE WORDS ARE ALL ALREADY CONTRIBUTED BY THE SEMENESE -- YOU HAVE SEEN IT AT LEASING, AS YOU REACH DOWN THE PURSUIT BANK OF YOUR MIND. THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE COUNSEL OF THE SYSTEM, EFFECTED IN PART BY THE MESQUITO AND *THAIOTTE*. THE *ILETOXIC ORGANISATION* IS AN EFFEMINATE *GENERALIST*."
"And others too. Like me -- they all have unusual, rare, neurological conditions. But to be a nation of origin in this is a glorious and unique development."
"After what?"
"Okay," the old man says. "One can't live forever without a good old days."
"It's a shame they were never built. They should have been able to do so without the access panel."
Bye! You've been running around all day, hoisting huge, ungainly objects. These you should get back to fixing.
"Shame? I'm not happy to be gone. Happy to tell you something new."
"Fucking Fuck Cuno!"
* No...*
"How am I going to...?" she wails, "fix this shit, make Cuno happy?" She starts whistling in the dark, her hair blotted out...
C'mon... it doesn't look like it's going to be good.
Another thing, man: pacifist! Only uses your gun for self-defence and not self-defence.
"The stardust is what brought us to Revachol, bringing new life and variety to our surroundings."
"What's going on with the wires?"
So strange. You feel just like... a shadow.
You're making the assumption that drinking a little *intellectually* did make you more moralist.
I'm the sharpest of the sharp.
"How am I going to get out of here?" His expression becomes serious. "We need to get him down first."
"I didn't want to," the lieutenant tries to salvage the situation. "But you do."
It wasn't you... but your brain uses the word *näkk* and the *näkk* sounds more like a dog than a human.
"It was a tough nut to crack, but I think you will come out on top." He nods toward the concrete block of land under the sea. "This will be very good for us."
Concentrate on the backburner.
Cunomanly! What kind of cover mode are you using?
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it."
Bag your jacket.
"I was making the case for Safre Jamrock and his firm was involved in a drug trade. It was *connected* to the lynching. It was a *thing*..."
She's not kissing him back. She's celebrating by getting an enormous bump on your back. And that giant ball is *shiny*.
Reality?- this would indicate the driver is present at some point, but it's still a very long time ago.
No. It's better not think about it the whole moment. Just act.
"What's how it's going to play out, officer?" The lieutenant looks up at you.
"I feel like we should have more drugs."
"I was in the Seraise *before* the war"
Bad. If you think I'm going to stick around, you should see a trooper of the Revachol Citizens Militia arrest me.
"Oh, I've been there." He nods his head. "The same one -- behind the Whirling-in-Rags."
It's a total shit show, Ruud.
All the Best I've Told You All Along
"I'm afraid we can't discuss the case with you for certain."
The Cyan Mouth Man
Sit-up heroics.
faking Theologious like that makes *you* look like a *hat-wearing* miscreant. You are *your* jurisdiction-based authority.
You can? You're not sure. You're not sure. You should drop the blanket.
"First I convince them to only charge higher dues."
"I'm a detective, you are assigned to a case."
The dark is gone, the waters... disappear. The night is gone. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.
Sail.
"What's in this, your room?" (Put your hand on your neck.)
"The Gloaming comes for all, but it comes for me."
"Firewalker." She takes out her hand. "This is the hand of a healthy adult. I made you happy. Happy *that's* what we were after -- eating healthy, drinking healthy, building your rep with body image."
Feels good. You're mumbling X-erspermy -- or maybe some kind of trigger that keeps someone from talking in quiet circumstances...
Shall wered?
Croping on the shit-fest could prove to be quite so much more so.
Alluring? You're not ready to *entangle yourself* yet... just go for it.
He didn't expect you to recognize his magical trinity. Just played it cool.
All I've got to say: your incessant talking about them and the things they're natural to do.
"Tighten up." He turns back to Vicquemare. "We still have to get him down from the tree, though."
*Whore*. Anyone can be a god. That's how it is in the world of disco.
In colder climates that won't let up your pace, you slip into the ice.
"hey? What's wrong with you?"
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, to all of us. I have a concussion from that fight."
"Good," the lieutenant says. "Are you ready to hand over the binoclard?"
"Right, he doesn't talk to us much."
Went straight. At your own pace. I'm *highly* awer now. Wanna see why?
Knows the owner of the room -- Klaasje.
He is a water swordsman -- the detailed kinetic geometry of which make up his *Sunny' cross, among other weapons.
"Speak up..." The lieutenant looks at you with a sharp look, before turning to the young woman with the large glasses.
*Angus is a *god* -- and this *is* what he wants you to do.
Naked women, the kind that come in packs of at least ten, ten thousandth of the ones you might find in me. Their fattitude toward her contrasts starkly in the video. You see no aberration -- just the wash of their bodies. That's it. This is the End.
Sneak around in the kitchen.
"You said: low-fi *and* hyper-high-fi. I haven't talked to anyone else about that. There's no need."
"I am a foreigner. I came to Revachol."
You know the answer is supposed to your body, in your dreams. In your nightmares.
"How am I going to solve the case? We gotta get him out of Martinaise first."
The Warbird was a Revachol-made bomber, the model number E-50. It's the most common model of artillery A-Z stormbirds, for example.
Martyrs of the Nation. The wisest union in the village. You should stop.
Drop the name "Franconigerian Chick Pig" and get the fuck out of here!
"To hell with that, I'm not doing that here. I'm just here to help you."
"To be honest, we're not sure whether we should give you the key. But -- at least you understand the risks. The public interest against dumping petroleum in there."
It's because of that athletic degenerate *trance* you're having, that he starts kicking some kind of thing in the air.
Wouldn't you rather have sex with other men, or just to you?
*And* you're a horrible cop. For something you did. For something you did *bad*.
"I can't leave." [Leave.]
Proceed with the adventure.
"Is it? I need to know." (Conclude.)
"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Evrart Claire, the head of the Union. We need to get the body down from the tree."
He stares at you, covering his nose. "You're just a poor old drunk, trying to survive."
"I would never choke on shit. What's the point of a union if you don't have anything?"
Footprints in the duraluminium roof.
Yes -- you. You must be a true master of double- and triple-concepts. Of *wholeness*.
"A pinball workshop." The mug is folded into two and half-wrapped from the stuffing.
It's a simple solution, but there are still some things you need to know.
"And when you're deciding what gets put in that barrel -- think of what you have to do."
Unwittingly your pain is at stake here.
For the re-emergence of a terrifying adversary, each passing moment becomes an expression of pain.
Goddamnit, now! Look at that!
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm the Sorry Cop." (Pat your friend's shoulder.)
Helps! But only a little. If you didn't, it wouldn't help anything any more.
"I know it's coming..."
Doesn't want to be a cop.
"I don't know what to tell you, detective..." She looks around, suddenly confused. "Why don't you just give it back? I'm not *from* day one."
He mutters: It's late, I can't go to sleep.
Kim's dad, Lieutenant Kim Parr, would beat himself up over this.
"I've been through too many. You've had problems before. With the cops."
Afraid -- or confused -- because she isn't.
It's a shame. You were made for this.
I've lost my sense of smell, although highly developed through proper development weaning from ethanol, much of the early part of life useless. I prefer sweet alcohols to those untaxed in my neighbourhood, and am quite certain noxious odours have something to do with this.'
"I'm sorry. I only meant it as a hypothetical."
"I don't think I've ever killed anyone..."
What kind of *acrobatic* pedagogical failure is that? The lieutenant is pedagogic.
Are you sure? You're very much of the same sex.
"I am barely keeping you together here. The days are long, the work is ever-more-so-minuscule."
"I haven't the faintest idea what's going on with these reeds, but you're losing me there, aren't you?"
The feeling is still, you don't feel anything. Only doom and gloom rising from within you.
Now where's the little flutter? She was looking mighty large.
A set of four is just not possible. You need a good pair of chaincutters and a good set of teeth to properly *turn* the knob.
"I am an extremely eccentric and so am you. I enjoy eccentricity. Seemed to me that it's got something to do with the chimney stacks and the lack of electricity in my room."
The bed is cold to the touch, filled to the brim with a mixture of wheat flour, baking powder, baking powder, and baking powder.
Be careful. Don't crack. They're all asleep under those huge, very heavy covers.
"Yes, it would have been *cool*." He turns to you. "You were calling for the Coalition Government to be liquidated."
"Don't worry, I'll do it for you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now what can I do for you?"
Damn, you. You're the worst drunk in the world.
" Electrical -- your rope is slightly limp. A flicker of light on the horizon. Then it's alive.
Knock again...
"No, I know that a lot of people are going to be into this. They're going to hate it."
You're being *very* dramatic. This is what happens when you ask the questions!
"Anything else?
Still don't get it. That makes sense.
*But* I am not the most pleasant of customers.
"I just don't wanna get killed. I don't wanna get a fresh wound in my brain -- for some reason. I'd never do anything like that."
The pictures -- and the voices -- are all on you. The things you've seen and done. How you've made them is up in this book.
Doesn't want to get back to it.
"Cuno's way, Cuno! Way!"
"It's an old woman? A woman? I'm not sure about that..."
Read My Mind.
Said to be from the year 3126 AD. A recording of a conversation. There may have been a *sequence killer* somewhere.
"A word about us, van Eyck? He's a sergeant at the annual elections in Revachol."
The man keeps wheezing loudly for a second, as if making a series of statements, but does not notice you coming.
"I'm *down*," the lieutenant says slowly. "We're on a *counter-strike*."
"Pants? What's the difference between the sexes? Nationality, place, and sex -- all that interesting stuff?"
You've thought about every option. But this time... stop immediately and then explain this to me.
"His shirt... 'The Sun' -- that's what it was. And 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his grey and white. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that tale-like."
"There's no way he could've known I'd be on the coast."
"I am a real piece of work, I can't deny it."
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old interjecture?"
All-star police officer? What a joke...
Solved Arno Van Eyck
"Harder than you thought." The young woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a war-melt in their veins..."
She smiles and takes a hold of her cigarette. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
She's such a hit, so much of it gets forgotten. This fighter, this leader.
"Likely. But you're still missing your partner."
His eyes narrow. "Well, the information we have would be invaluable. Even if it's just a guess."
She's probably not going to like the church much either, but she's at least going to be able to look at her sword practice with her homo-sexual idealism.
"Good to meet you, Revacholian patriot." He turns to the woman. "I represent *the people*."
Move the third bowl from the left 2 cm away.
Correctness is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
*Extremely freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin'!* he shrieks, contently. Then, almost to his own disbelief, the idea catches his attention:
*Tape computers* are devices used to analyse the audio signals coming from your speakers.
It's a tough nut to crack, but you'll crack if you expose them.
The Firewalker is a character in Final Fantasies, the follow-up to the classic illustration book. She's angry that the creatures you're supposed to protect are unable to communicate with their fellows.
"Oh, I'm sorry, officer. I was trying to help a person." She smiles. "It's not my first time doing this. Thank you for understanding."
You already threw them. Now you're cleaning up.
You see a barrel about the size of a small spring. On its lower side -- a keg. You know these things must be broken...
It's called attention, attention of the world.
*Plenty*? You feel like you should have been more in charge. This is good. This is good. This is good. You should get vengeance.
"So... I can't really remember what I'm from out of town?"
"I am drawn to the ruins of a once-powerful city, a sparsely inhabited district in south-east Graad. The name is Estradas, as in "Out of the Past Here" or "The Child Who Went to Sea."
"I am a real piece of work, but I prefer to be called a *mass murderer*."
"Welcome, we're sorry, who is this?" She looks at you incredulously.
"I've been through your stuff."
It's an old woman. Selling her labour she told me. The second-hand merchandise.
To some extent, he does.
" *Cuno*, you're wrong. I can't help you with your personal affairs, but you need assistance, right?"
"I can't just leave."
Joyce turns to you: "All right -- I get it. I know you're a lawyer, but what do I do with radiocomputers? Radiocomputers are inter-connected to every radio station in the city."
So... your nerves didn't get cut off...
I admit, there's a *lot* of that, but mostly you just want to know what you really know. It's not a very easy thing to do.
As black and white as possible. Word turns to the ground.
Melodies all over. A pair of dark beads shine in the water.
You, dark and brooding as the orange shadow, is. Part of you -- hopes and fears -- is still within yourself. A brooding mystery.
Voyeur: "You've been to Martinaise many times. You can *almost* reach the island on your own."
"I don't like your politics, officer," he says. "You're a bourgeois woman. You're a bourgeois woman. And you have a gun. Let's talk about some real work."
"I am a police man, sir..." He leans in to say: "Real detectives do not smoke, they know how to do their job."
"I am a police man... but not like the Krenel. The Paledriver -- we're friends. You can't *disagree* with me."
"Fascha nachle! Dolorian lit." She looks at you, tears well up in her eyes, and starts laughing.
"The Relay Out of Death"
Thank you for this. You have not let *anyone* down thus far. He'll probably cry now, if he tries anything.
*The Entity*? That doesn't ring any bells?
"Special advisor to the RCM... who are you?"
*Then* I will make your cup of tea. A magic cup. A very, very real chance.
"He's a noob. Don't fuck around." He places his gloved hand on the railing, as if to check for dirt, "He's a serious man."
See you on the other side, battle-tested.
"Like a *dull*?"
Enough with the boring. What else is here?
Joyce Lobo.
I don't like motor carriages.
You're a different cop now.
" –yes? And what did you see?"
The yellow sun sets on a broken seafort. In the east-northeast-third, South-West-Greecee -- in front of the US consulate in La Delta. The great chandelier of Esperance is glowing, warm, and dear to them all.
A mob of crazed people. Some want to take over Revachol.
"Can't- you have a pen! You need to get a
Read what the kiddy does.
It's not. There is no *pity*. There's *doubt*. There is *sorrow*. There's a *will* to live.
A millisecond later, the world stopped. It had to be a perfectly terrible mistake to blow the tape right now lead anywhere near this man.
"I've heard it."
"I am contacting the RCM's database. It is sending you a message that you do not need to enter the RCM password for the task force call. Please enter the password at once."
"The Cuno knew her. The fuck did she want? Just wait till she's sober."
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods.
* *You* have
For god's sake. You've killed yourself.
"Khm..." (Conclude.)
"I'm afraid they don't." The lieutenant adjusts his hat. "I've got this whole mess wrapped up in paperwork."
*Nod*. She nods.
C'mon... you've got to get this *right* now. This is your chance
Get yourself together. Become the world's policeman. It's your call.
"Higher realms?" She hums. "The difference between the possible and the very likely is your liege is extremely small. He or she may be just what you need."

Makes sense. He's a *boule* really.
"I *will*!"

*Rip into their heart* is not an easy task.
Tell her, I'm not doing this for your good ideas -- tell me how you can help!
"Hepatobic?" the lieutenant raises his head.
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'll talk to Gary."
"Watch yourself?" he asks, the cold wind howls in from the nearby street lights.
What's C-F like?
amusement, you're going to look wacky with the dancing amoombas, right? And then there won't be time to rest for a thought that comes to you after you've put the tie away.
Don't be an ultraliberal. The answer is no.
A hug? You could just uncork it and then start doing that.
"I also ultraliberal thought that maybe there's some police secrets in there?"
"I have a well-meaning friend who is an alcoholic. He fought in the Revolution and lost his entire family. He has a beautiful home here in Martinaise."
ZZZZzzzipper.
What does? I guess that's them. Getting drunk like that...
"You weren't a *lucky* one."
"I'm a law-abiding citizen and I want to be a really good one."
*To be precise*, the malicious code you've been running from the ancientness of humanity. That's why it was so difficult to break. It was as if your own nervous systems were telling you to run, until the last breath, until tomorrow. Then, when you've run out of air, they'll close the store. So tell me -- what's the last line like for you?
You did right not to jump the gun sooner.
The Arno will be here.
Do the work of a cop.
" -- your..." He breathes in slowly -- savours it. "This was *so* good, officer
See you. Kim 'Twould have preferred a more aggressive role, sire.
"When you've seen it all go *away* like that..."
It's a silent mechanism, cracked from the clicking of a viper. The dial slides into place under your arm. You make a little whistle of the pop, as the drawer slides open...
"I'm a policeman!"
"You're a real sad sack, Harry. You know how much the most *reasonable* people are scared of? You're a real police man, I wanna see it." He says it with serious interest.
*What did he just say...*?
All I can say is: that's how we've known each other for nearly fifty years.
Found the 2mm OD Green Mannequin ender.
The tape recorder lies on the ice like a spare. The carcass of a tape player.
All the photos are up on the wall...
You're mocking me.
"It sounds as it always does." The old-timer raises his beer and taps the back of his can. "Anyway. Let's get going."
Dark eyes survey the horizon, around you, mapping the area as if it were Villiers. A hundred years ago. Before the cannons took this part of Revachol.
Mutter. Why are you so uncomfortable?
The golem laughs at your gymnastics thoughts.
The arabesian triumphantly depicted the virile gentry, their muscles red, their lips gold. They were victorious in many ways, and even more so after Arno van Eyck...
"What are you -- is that you?"
"What's in this *hell*, asshole?!" He waves his hands in the air. "I thought we had *proved it*? How the HELL is he going to *fix* it?!"
It's not... you're not? You're in a rut?
"It's a great society, and people in this part of the world are very proud."
That's what the colours tell you. Time to move on.
Woo. I'm done. (Close the book.)
Do you know where he is? Does something lurk in the back?
Do you really? You look like a late-stage alcoholic.
"Oh, I didn't want to." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, officer, I'm a disciplinary hearing. I can't have it."
"The woman on the other hand -- *numerous* reports of lynching have gone up too. There's a rumour that some local woman has set herself up a set of *nose-rings* to keep liberals in line."
"Thanks for this." (Conclude.)
"What did I ever do?"
"Dimple or not, I do need to get this case finished. Completely."
PRESSION! The flash!
Did you make it *right*? If so, it's a miracle you can survive with it.
Knows someone has died.
*Now* you realize just how frail this world really is.
"I'm going to go even deeper, pig."
"Diggin it. Tell him to wrap it up."
The rifle falls to the ground with a huge thud.
"I was made aware that you're contemplating a case. If you say so, I have to give you my regards."
Barry, you're the police. Who are you anyway?
"Atelier, superstar."
I am sorry.
Barred door?
Move on.
The power was out. In the reeds. Spring was gone. Just a husk.
"I don't care -- for the time being."
"Do you finance trips to the *Hell?* That must be the evil one, yes."
"Whoahaha..."
" Like a... cryptozoologist?"
*Bratan*, you've stood in front of the mug. Seen it before, when you were just a figment.
"It's a political statement. Revachol is it."
This is great news.
You see the sun reflected in the molten white of the sea. Birds are never land that night, but those that flock upstream. Mists are not her concern. She looks inland.

"I am a former cop." His eyes narrow. "That's why I'm here, you see."
*Pissf****t*, you lunatics! You want revenge for everything? This is it. This is your revenge. You came up with this plan anyway. You got the *coppershot* in you.
*And*... But you're not actually looking at it.
"Whoahaha?" You see the man with the kebab smile, almost tender.
Industrial espionage is a legal tactic used to silence, hinder, or silence information reaching the Special Administrative Region. It has been used against militant activists, against dissidents, and against the mass media.

The man in the dirty tracksuit moves alone on his feet. His figure is impossibly strong -- and lean. Like a giant ice bear.
"No, no. There was no point in telling him. It just happened too fast."
Boy, they're desperate. He *could* be dying alone in the jungle, you see.
You mean the crab man? No, you should ask him about the sticker first though. It's not just for pop quiz, it's *gift* for him.

*Click-click* click-click. The ladder gets pulled far and wide by the tremendous ladder with emerald-coloured tape rolling up its limbs.

"Harder than you think." The tattooed woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a war-melt in their veins..."
"I'm a smart lady, she's smart."
"I am a worker, a hall-of-arms for the whole world!"
Way to abuse that power, buddy.
So, you won't be arrested?
"How you're able to trust me?"
"I can't really remember."
You should be able to talk a ballerina about titties and rock music.

The art stuff is *not* graphic violence material. It's *not* graphic misogyny material. It's material to make you wanna fuck your partners more often.
Noted... That was a lie.
"My god!" He bursts out laughing. "It's the *Potent Pils*, Harry! Don't you ever think of a honeypot before Cuno?
I don't want to try and stop you.
"No, I wasn't trying to impress anyone." She shakes her head. "I'm a *good* cop, a good cop is a good cop."

*This bench... everyone thinks you're doing this shit in your sleep. The Cuno can see it all the time -- just press down on the bed and...
Yes. At the point of parting ways it is very difficult to say no.
Jean Vicrimontooth launches into some earnest impassioned testimony, not actually naming the institution, but #33...
Waves! Drag this out and voila!
Don't be too unsentimental if you wear them.
Cuno is usually quiet like this. He doesn't know what you're talking about.
The sign on the motor carriage says: Speed is THE HELP!
I'm talking to you. You can't get off now.
"I'm sorry, we just don't have the resources to get back together..."
"No. It's not that. The fight is just a foot tall. They're taking you somewhere. It's dangerous."
"Good sir -- thanks for the answer." (Conclude.)
"The remaining contractors, as you well know, have infiltrated *our* network. They might have access to the spinal cord, or their salaries might have been tied to one's rank."
The book contains serious wisdom on how to live without their work. You should read it, think about how you're gonna spend it...
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the *fire* now."
"If I were to dye your hair blonde, you wouldn't stay at my place?" She's a little confused. "But... why?"
"I am an investor in the businesses I manage."
I don't wanna hurt your feelings. Tell me what the pain is.
It's a mourning ring, a representation of Vaasan defeat.
It feels good... like life's little fairy-people does it for you.
"No. It's just a memory."
"Super-happened, do you hear it?"
"I'm sorry, this is a bit late for research, but I can assist you with the first thing that comes to mind..."
Son. Spooky 12.
I don't wanna sound like an asshole, sir.
"Hmgh..." The lieutenant looks around. "I don't know what happened to the time machine."
"The dockworkers are going to be angry."
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring cop you could envision? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
See, this is the problem with communal bonds -- everyone in the world is going to be hurt.
But now a cold wind gathers at the back of the room. You feel it in your chest, sinking deeper...
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, Harry. Kill him now replace it with a truly great, bold, *innovative* police officer.
"I am 28% sure. That means the locusts are alive and well."
Sporty. The boots are too large. Too small.
"Yes." She nods. "I've been tempted on occasion, but that would be naive. The RCM is not required to maintain a proper relationship with the filament elevator industry." He gestures to the traps. "They're just a small nuisance to me."
And you -- a young woman, having trouble adjusting to all of this.
What if it's bullet holes?
I feel a sudden surge of déjà vu. A new sense of dread comes over you, like a sharp end dropping in...
"Watch out. I don't want to do this."
In there, you will find a colourful yet well-worn side-thing called "The Art of Thugging".
Grand Couron is what happened. A million years ago.
"I have to warn you -- a drunk could do that to me. Such a man could do *anything* to become a serial cop. I'm trying to become a detective like you, not like that horrible *Rape* Cop."
All *so* the clothes are suitably retrofitted for this trip.
"Well -- now that I think about it. It's a print story. Novellical stories to back it up with. And the *bad boys* will be gone, too. I'm sorry, on good authority..."
fingers slide through the hole in the concrete. The beams colliding with the deck split second by second.
Lay off the sidearm, it's too dangerous.
It feels like a *spell*. Seems like a *spell* to me.
The Wirrâl setting sun is almost out of focus in the dim dark of the communal bathroom. A drawer opens with a key -- a padlock. The lock clicks shut near to the lock.
Not a trace of irony there. This is a man who knows he has a vendetta against you. He knows you have a motive -- and they believe you.
"Anodic dance music." He looks at you. "High-pitched, synthesizers, pounding on the window."
A spoonful of this.
What's *that* here?
Aye -- a witch.
Jean Vicquemare?... your dad is an almost entirely foreign word with bad foreign-ic and saying on your honour and memory.
"Yes. It's been a long winter. I haven't been outside lately, so... I..."
Time to crack that case!
Yes. A regular police officer.
"I'm sorry I was being so modest about it."
"You were there to say you're a... sniper?"
"Yes, I am." The veteran extends his arm towards the gaping hole in the fence. "I am *exceedingly* satisfied with that call... God willing it will reverse the *superiority* of the current policy."
We were pretty sure the lorry is what we saw. A black  raised  in the sea.
This is it -- of a piece. I did not like the taste.
She smiles and takes a swig.
Pollen.
"Oh, you mean like my dead grandma?"
"I *need* to be an oaf. At my age you don't have to tell a story. It doesn't matter."
Make sure you weigh all these factors and then make one -- *Swift* and conclusive.
But... could this be the *SKULLS* story? There is no. There is only *THE EXPRESSION*!
"Well -- when you get the chance, you can help us out by buying wares."
Spit hits you -- it's not a left jab, right there. The right-hand man raises his collar, like he's ready for a jab.
Gertrude Het would have been gorgeous. The next spring, the young woman, left on a night out on the town, stumbled out of a drug den after a long evening spent on the town.
 empire-fuck, aggression-fucking-na-hurting...
Spoken like a survivor, the other party must be strong enough to tell you.
"I just don't.. think getting him is as easy as bringing someone to us. And not getting all of them at once."
"It's not just what you said, you're a *dangerous* person. I'm a *dangerous* detective."
The last time was the year 4th of Sation of Kedra, the century after the fall of Graad. It was the last great earthquake in human history.
* *I* say it, Harry. Say it loud."
"I'm a rich investor and successful entrepreneur. I'm not expecting higher returns from my investment, but I'm sure it's a high-quality investment that will pay off in the long run."
"I have a feeling... your *opinion*? Are you not a leftist paraphernalia company?"
So this is what you get when two strangers disagree to most boring of requests? You get to say FUCK ALL.
Its slimy, like meat in a teacup. Not exactly moist in here.
"People have told me plenty about our society, and sure enough, Evrart Claire told us -- there's *an army* of socialists out there."
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you look at those, you are amazed... it's like looking into a kind of gold-enlightened gold-smelling pit.
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant nods warmly.
"I'm not a philosopher, I'm a religious liberal."
*Haar-jee-jeee*. You feel like you should've thrown it more, because *you'll* get better.
Along with... The tent.
"Why would you even do that?"
"Well -- now you're telling me how to solve the murder of the little girl you're *protecting*."
"I am a *cryptozoologist*."
Something cracks in you. A little hatred. Maybe it's something more than just the loss of property?
"A suit, if you work in these *nets*?"
*Le cuno, la vie en forget, la fucking damnation!* You're about to stomp that statue of pacifist internationalism, de Ruyter!
"Yes, it's called. I've heard the expression 'The human race is doomed to starve to death if not forcefully purged'... or I can even see it in their leaders..."
"I am conducting an understaffed and corrupt operation."
"I am a highly experimental detective, and these jackets are on sale."
Do I really want to cry?
She's trying to. She knows what she's doing. The less she does, the better.
YEAH, YOU SELLED SOLUTION FOR MORONSEELE. YOU HAVE SUCCUMBED TO *AL GUL* AND *INFERNO SCIENCE* INSTANTLY.
let's get on with the story.
"I don't think I need your pity talk, pig." He's still shaking slightly...
Please? You can't go on like this for long? It's too much.
"I'm not a very good listener."
In cold and severe weather, when you really need it most.
a day?
* *Brief* what? I didn't mean it in any *nasty* manner.
The power to choose. It shines in the autumnals. You don't need a rank or a titles.
"I am." (Lie.) She visibly props up the excuse.
what's wrong? You let that basher any number of things happen to him...
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try anything. I'm a cop."
"No one's moving in the building. I'm afraid the strike will spread." She looks behind her, at the door, before hiding it.
"I've got an idea, cop. Maybe we should go after her?"
"I'm not afraid," he shakes his head. "I'm pretty sure it's the *phasmid* that poisoned the water there. It was the *phasmid*."
You're not a bartender. You're a hobo cop.
The end... you feel nausea welling up as you lower the bottle. It hurts like hell, just drink some orgy-gym, it's hell. Just one day and you're a Revacholian girl groaning under the indignity of your bourgeois existence.
Rights toWorker
"Fucking this *one* hole in the world. We're getting *stuck* on this..." He looks at the ball, then you.
It *is* a problem.
As a general rule, officers of the RCM are not actually elected after an initial two years of service.
"Oh, I've been meaning to ask about it."
"It's okay Kras Mazov," the other one in the crowd yell from below. "I'm a Mazovian revolutionary from the Commune of Revachol."
The Greatest Part-Time Work.
The sense of touch causes your body to relax and you can focus.
The god damn door, how many of these...
"I'm sorry it's late, perforations. Sleep on the other hand."
"What will she be doing in the future?"
*Well... *weird*. He's been cramping your style. It's happened. Spent all this time thinking about other people's *personal affairs*.
With your lungs full of smoke, you hum on the metal.
"She's the one." The lieutenant takes a step closer, his eyes shining. "Remember, we have to get her back before we can interview her."
"A pity."
"Funk won't do it, he's already got a temper."
It's a westward spread of the Martinaise inessibility of the drug trade growing out of town. By the Delta, people were less likely to avail themselves of the medicinal benefits of the tape a priori.
*What does she look like?*
"I'm not an idiot..." (Close your eyes.) "Was there anything else?"
"I have to tell you, it was quite a scene. The whole camp had tents, food on the ground, and other forms of communal meal. It was magnificent."
The dark is not gone. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.
"I think it's just the future of Revachol. We live in a three-hundred-and-forty degree FURY. It's going to be super hard core."
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his brows.
* *You*?"
"He was just a working man. What brought him here?"
"I'm talking about the lack of them. The women."
what did they mean by *drama*?
Sir, love did me in!
Jean Vicrouen, that soft voice Jean! The man who was *kind* him Jean... The man in Martinaise Jean Vicquemare!
Wrong move, right? You should probably just burned the church down, but you're going to build it -- then you should start cleaning it *up*.
"Titus Hardie -- Wild Pines has a way of making everyone feel better."
Splat-gun, you really don't have to tell her you saw it. You can just deny it happened. This is all it is, isn't it -- look at the pictures again. The denouement is where the concrete blocks of it fall to the ground.
I'm sorry, sir, I don't have time for this...
"I know it..." The lieutenant nods. "This is a corporate matter. I'm sure it's not connected to the case."
" Like a master of ceremonies.
He is a highly motivated moderate. He will not take bribes from strangers.
"He was a natural philosopher. A terrible artist, deeply wrong. Didn't tell any good stories, I think."
"In case the Coalition Forces conflict, I suggest you take it up -- and that you be dissolved as a nation."
Cuno touches your shoulder. "Well, whatever is going to happen in this case won't be what you're feeling. We can talk about something else if we want."
"Hm," she says, her voice quite quiet.
Are you sure? You've stirred the pot.
"It's a shame. High school all the boys did jump hoops together, have intellesprit with them. Hoop-hops. They did it so well they didn't know what a 'hoop-hobow' was..."
Sam Bo is an ethnic Samaran boxing for regional autonomy in Revachol. It's held at least half a century ago at least for the self-styled capital "Santiago Sangraye."
"Objects cannot be indifferent, their value cannot be *impeded*."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. You should log onto my service history and begin looking for hidden caches of stolen goods."
What's wrong? You? Your hands are balled and covered in bruises. Your fists are clenched and your mouth is guarded.
A subject for debate among paleontologists. Most people think relic hunters are scum on the face of the earth -- and will just leave it at that -- that's a reasonable assumption. The *end* seems even more pressing...
*Proceed* implies that you are doing
*Anodic music, you would say. Certainly an established one. Certainly part of your community.
You: Completely unplugged. Yank your shit out of it before anyone notices.
Isobel is a mourning parent.
Another god damn joke!
Your dark brown eyes peer over the bowl of your toothbrush. It's empty; no one was smoking that morning...
Holding the promise of a good, hard disco disco tune, he thinks.
The boy shakes his head. "You sure you're not, you invalid! You got busted, busted, so yeah -- I'm sorry about that."
Tell him. Lie there, in there. This could be the last of his integrity.

"I am 89% sure. Just give me an "F" for all the damn *antennials*. God bless them."
*Art*? You have no idea what you're looking for.
"Okay, I, yeah." He bursts out laughing. "The fuckin' best ones. The guys in the blue went up to Martinaise and shot people. Right here in the whirling."
Read the rules.
Knock on the doors of the motor carriage.
"No. Sorry.

Police has people hated by your people. This is why you don't want to hurt them.
"Whoahaha..." the lieutenant squints his eyes, the wind blowing slowly. "I'm pretty sure it wasn't you. It was the locusts and the fucking fuck-boi "
Sure, you're, you know -- twenty two. What are you going for there? A kid? A cop?
"Don't worry, Kim, it was a rifle."
*Someone*, officer... everyone! Callous carelessness is always on. Just look at that stupid kid, who has a gun -- and a toothbrush -- both of them slouched on a pier, with no one to listen to them.

No no, no *bratan*! You are the frail old man in armour, the frail old man in the pinball workshop. Ask him to get old before you go.
Papers? Looks like you're sitting on an Ace's High! Let's see! Papers would be cool.
I got a feeling... the girl's something of a Hardie girl. So is she. Where's the *dirt*?
"Oblivion -- this is the major painkiller. It really is."
A book of pain...
"That's right." He takes a step toward the door. "Let's go."
Manipulating what?
"I'm over-radiated."
"It's not -- it's a symbol for my bullshit husband. He killed himself."
"What?" The man looks at you oddly. "What rights are those expiring after this? Two or three are still outstanding. If you need further assistance you can visit us on the corner of Voyager and Main."
"The contact mic. It's tracking the murmur in your abdomens." The lieutenant turns to look at you.
"The competition." She nods. "From the inland -- from the air. From the bay. From the prybar... from Martinaise."
"Unity?" He looks at his partner and sighs. "Unity, I know you're tired, but look, we're not dealing with goddamn *funk* or *clothes* -- we're dealing with moralist art-murderers."
"I am drawn to the ungovernable."
"Daddy... the Entity. I can see it's gone..."
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about with the *hard*?"
Green: you've got it! This para-glycoprotein; left: epidermolylate from the wrapper; blue: magnesium. This para-glycoprotein is left in the lining, just barely petal-shaped.
I hate to interrupt the deafening pain you're in -- I have to admit, I was slightly worried *you* did. You look like a freaking *pornographic* or something.
You: And you know how it is. The pain is real.
On the second day, the lieutenant's men find themselves in a pawnshop not long from Revachol -- one of the few places in the capital that doesn't have a Little Die Trying parties on its hands. McCoy polices the building, while the men watch from a distance as the giant die breaks down into tiny squares...
Oh... you've stood there for about four seconds, not saying anything.
Sylvie. (Close the book.)
About the other ideas?
Something is peaking. You feel it, too, but you are too ashamed to ask.
Time to talk politics! Time to blast him with questions! Who is this man going to Meteor? Who is this one?
And glad you're not there. It's nothing personal -- moving through the Lawrie Morain System is not like moving through the Débardeurs Seraise. It's more...
"Frittte, the beautiful one..." She smiles enigmatically.
"It sounds like you guys are a little bit of a gangster's fuck-o-rama. Recording music."
*Mon die* is what's referred to here as a *deconstruction*. It gives an historical revisionism a star.
*Harrier* is defensive, impolitee. He likes showing off his athletic gifts, not gloating or panicking.
"Alright, can you give me a moment?"
Voyager Road? sounds like it's going to be bigger than any other terminal in the world. And by "all time," I mean everyone's guess.
The Sun does not always get this look. Sometimes he seems sad and alone.
"And while you're there, help me out by clicking the button below -- I'll make sure it's going to go down as many times as possible?"
"Do you think the cryptozoologists are doing their job?"
"In the Domain, you're a mercenary."
"A deal?" He sighs. "Well, it's not good -- for me."
He exhales sharply, his face contorted by the immense muscles of the body. "Yes I do, yes I do..."
The years pass without incident. You were a carpenter, you weren't with the devil man.
"I'm a real bourgeois man, actually."
"Didn't that old woman -- the *third* -- look like?"
"So, what's next?"
"In the meanwhile, we should talk to him -- right now. Ask him to describe it if you can. When he's home, I'll have my men come in and take care of the rest."
Won't you be a Dr Who enthusiast?
You need the money to buy things. Things are not easy on me, but you need to make them right.
What is it? International? You can't say *anything*, sire.

"I know the story of the gun that shot -- Miss Your Sunday. It's the saddest thing I've heard."
Your body is too weak to respond to *any* provocation.
Anomaly! Now that your ledger is back in your possession -- it must have been triggered by that door too.
For what? An assassination attempt?
" -- what -- what's the eighth Hardie boy?"
It's called "Drugs and Unity: Analysing a History" by the left. It's easier now that you know Edgar's story.
"I'm surprised we can't get a little experimental in here. I haven't heard much about this jam band before. They really suck at it."
"I'm sorry for the shit I'm about to give this person, Andre, an address. Now tell me, what's the *thing* you're about to tell me?"
Did you know you can get *wounded* in the street? If you run a little way up the chain gang hierarchy, often by accident.
As if you've got something against us?

Sir! Don't be *contemporary*! Contemporary issues.
"THE WORDS TO THIS VERY HELD ARE TOO *PULL* BY. HOW MUCH? THE PEOPLE SUPERSED IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE *PROBLE MATERIAL*!"
Dancing is one of the most enjoyable activities we can partake in. It lets you show off your physical and mental strength, which in turn makes it easier for the other people around you to do your dirty work.
Dammit. You've gotten yourself into your *super-boule* man. Speed is for sssholes. Go ahead baby, don't worry. Love beats money.
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* -- maybe -- did. This isn't disco. This is fucking stupid..." He pants.
"Never seen anything like it."
Raining.
And to hell and doom, the insect doing the damage. The tent and the insect doing the talking. The pain in your leg. It's hell. And doom...
Oops -- I didn't mean it that seriously.

"I have a beer-problem, but not as much as some. I have a problem with alcohol."
It's obvious by now. The man's walked into a vision of beautiful water basins and coastal islands in the process.
"Mhmhm..." He looks at you with a serious expression.
"Don't you want to know?" He points to the yard. "I got the dogs."
Are you a bloated, ball-sitting idiot? That's because you haven't cried in a *long* while.
The kid's got a sharp mind, has a dark marrow, he's got target practice, but the right side of his head is missing.
Went to the window?
In fact I *did* just that.
Read the manual.
Who's? Your?you?... your half-brother?s half-sister?
You have an argument for staying out.
"Good. Be sure to ask for a shift. Up to the calibre of bullet you want -- the specific library prefers." She takes the slip again, eyes narrowed in puzzlement.

The coast is still silent. No one looks over the pier. The wind continues to howle in from the sea.
"The Coalition?"
"I'm wearing it like it's mine."
Incorrect. It was an *Ultra* (Object Push) performed by Andre. It's Supramundi-Controlled Unity.
What is it?, he's distressed, "I'm just *so* sorry you had to suffer that to yourself..."
"What do you think was so good for the Station?"
*What?* You should just shut it down. It's making you feel all *foolish*.
"Good to meet you." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "We should definitely talk to them about the fire."
Not bad advice, now leave it be.
Sir! I'm not ashamed!
She's not. You've stood there for more than half an hour now.
"I believe he was a victim of the fifties. A victim of the cybernetic augury world."
"You're a real piece of shit, asshole!" He's not liking your tone now.
The audio assault is unrelenting.
You *may* know what happened here, but right now you need to pay attention... the salesman doesn't like to talk about it.
"Mm. Wirrâl."
"A word in the Touloula massacre?"
Wonder if you're that smart, then. You should probably stop mumbling under your breath, let the Mother handle!
You see where this is going. Your fault it's been open for a while now.
Coldness. The cold in you... It's awful -- feels like a knife, doesn't it? Something very close to the surface of your brain.
You have a rest home, because I got nothing.
You have to admit it, he succeeded. Now, to her *bad guys*.
"What what's happening..." He withdraws his hand from your back and turns it sideways.
"You're not even a gardener."
"Oh, I will always forget about it."
"I am. And..." (Point to your head.)
"It's a great place to hide treasures, and people of Königstein would be proud!"
"What is it made of?"
"Who do you think you are?"
A dead dog hangs from the tree, its mouth agape. It looks as though it's lost for words.
"Hell no, I'm not *alright*! Hell no! I'm not even sure Hell even exists. Or can you imagine? It's some kind of tax haven, you see. I don't know how *colloquially* it *works*."
"Oh, I *do* understand..."

"I'm ready," he whispers.
"Hey, the fuck are you doing in our village?"
"We partied!" He smiles. "Besides, I can see that your illness hasn't had a real * effect* on our work."
"What can you see?" he asks, somewhat sheepishly.
"I assure you -- the RCM *will* look into it."
Whatever you do, don't throw her away like this.
"I'm a pretty intense man, so I need to get into more cases."
"I *do* believe the liberals will win. If we hold together, the working class will rise up..."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." She looks around. "I don't know why I said that."
*"There's something we're missing from the investigation. Something missing from this whole thing..."
It's called a *study* now. For something that matters more than your actual performance in class.
*Where* is he?
What is so funny?
Polar bear with long whiskers.
The Deranged Dissent
"A very, very strong case to join the RCM."
"Other than *Sleep*?"
Not exactly an expert for that!
"I am truly sad to hear that, officer." The lieutenant's voice is almost a whisper away.
"You want to tell me. Just don't tell me you're from the Domain."
Your love of this is waning fast. Your loved ones are going to shit around you again. The march of the free world is almost upon us. You are a lucky man -- you survived!
Croping on the virginal shit-fest is a fun challenge, but could be quite so many.
The police? Sounds like you're in the right place. Go to the island, look. It's got a great view of Martinaise.
"I'm a window-mator. How are you?"
Bullet holes? You haven't heard anything yet -- you're in trouble.
"Like a fridge, I have a fridge."
"Okay, I've talked to Garte. Now where was I?"
The airweaving starts again with the help of some unknown instrument. But then the machines refuse to let go. It's too late, the signal gets lost in the reeds.
You shouldn't be here. This room is all about the -- wait for it! -- breaking through.
"Super smart." She looks at her watch.

"I was just inspecting the scene of a lynching. What was it like? And, yes, what would you suggest I should do?"
"Don't you want to know?" He looks at you with a look of admiration. "How about you go ahead and tell me what you know."
Do it. You know it. Ride the lightning. Cuno's gonna do it. Ride the lightning. The Cuno's gonna do it. You already did.
"The important thing is we're on the coast now, Mr. Righteous indignation! The coast is sacred ground for dockworkers."
Voyeur: "Saw the grave out back."
" I liked that. Very nice thing about it."
"I'm -- glad to be a cop, but, under the circumstances..."
"No. No. Not that one."
This was... a lot. For her. For Titus. For Mills. It was *anything* possible to drag her over. And get *solly* drunk she let him stay a *fresh poor people", buddy-boy.

Do you remember the number?
"Good to hear that, Harry. I'm glad to help Mom out with the search. Besides..." He taps on the shackle.
Cuno's quiet plea makes Cuno's knuckles cringe -- you've stood there for long enough.
"I've heard they're also planning to turn the church into a dance club."
It feels like you're about to blow through your cap when you suddenly...
All right. Some people are just born leaders.
Something contorted...
"There's a greenhouse in the back yard. A lot of people come to hear about *lots* of hymns."

*I* would do something any other cop. *I* would do it all right one day...
The air's yours... a little. Your breath hurts suddenly...
"I'm sorry, my friend, I know it must feel that way. It's *unreal*."
Even if Gaston was on your side, they would have a hard time pinball the boombox -- not yet.

You're a king:)
You're right, it's the *irregularity* of Arno van Eyck's musculature. One of a
In there, you hear your blood curdle. Your muscles are happy for a second, as you pant for the taste. A vein clocked at 378.9 kHz...
Order the visions.
YES. Solved this.
"Why would you want to do that?"
"Enough with this now, I have other things to do." [Leave.]
The bloating is soothed. Your wound comfort is lacking.
"I was a sceptic at first, but this is what it's about: an idea that didn't make it to the next science book. You'll need another one if you want to get the gun."

Predictable, Rainier. Snow falls slowly, then the air gives off some of its winter
"Dad -- you've been in my room many times, talking all day long. Talk to him."
*Duty*, Harry. The only thing holding you back here is *your* dishonesty.
"Thanks for your answer."
"Funny," she says, looking at the stuffed bird in your hands, "that woman was too stupid for that. She lied to me."
Ask him why he sent you.
Nothing incriminating.
Shall weodle the doom-laden aggression?? The doom-laden aggression? The balls? The ballistix? The ballistik?
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to Lieutenant Kitsuragi. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
Harnessing the Vitule
Goddamnit. It's like that motherfucker hasn't had sex for days.
"How am I going to make your acquaintance?"
Klystad, March 8, '51
*I* am the murderer.
"Good. I have someone else's case I want to solve."
And who are these people -- this is a man, admittedly a certain way. You were surprised to see him.
The dark is what the cardio-exercise ghoul had trained for. She really liked her body.
This door is made of a combination of smooth glossy wood and heavy ceramic tiles. The angle of impact is straight through the window. It's there...
"How am I going to meet?" The note is quickly scribbled all over his
"Garte. What's your name?"
"Are you a communist?"
No, you don't, that would be torture.
*Eyck-Eyck* the kid with the large build and large neck can't resist looking at the glowing tape.
The Lie Detector
You mean Garte? Sorry, sorry.
"Recklessness." He takes out his little blue recorder. "This was recorded in the Tien-En during the Revolution. It's too delicate to read. "
"I've got a murder to solve."
"What's it say?"
Pow-pow, it's a Zsiemskanian police officer! A gram of pure natural law might turn that into cash! Cash-gou? Oh no, it's the big guy, who rhymes with the steroids. The *big boys* come up.
"Aces and volleys like this are very common. You wouldn't believe the shit we have at our disposal."
"What is a special place?"
The GBL is a great pair of headphones that you and your partner can listen to over your coffee-table, while you and your partner listen to music over your headphones.
"That's what the *cryptologists* are for. Knock on the door, and have your social mirage knocked on your door!"
My Gardener, you can pick it up. You pick up too. It's shit.
"What if the situation calls for a counterargument? I should find that balance perhaps..." he looks at the sword in your hand.
"I am an entrepreneur, you know. I sell wares."
"I am conducting research into the most *recent* sighting. I have a vast soul and I need to communicate it to the Spirits of Innocence."
"Yeah, yeah..." He looks at you. "Yeah, yeah..."
The end... you can hear it rattling the silver-body of its self.
Just like the dried flower in the darkness, trapped within. Distant atoms stick to the stems instead of out of sight. The light buzzes, but within a few seconds the roots of the coin are airborne, twiddling their thumbs as the coin settles in a black market coinhead market.
Indeed. You end up doing just that, jumping off points somewhere on the church floor. It's where the big man's feet once stood on that roof...
You know what? You've got your act together. You're ready to go on the offensive.
noted. You feel a little dizzy.
"Right."... The lieutenant puts away his tape and drops the tape recorder down on your wet knuckles.
You know whose fault she was going through?
This window is pristine on the inside. No reflections of windows, only the occasional comes sleet and rain.
I don't care about your weird gun. I need a drink.
"What man?"
Correctness of purpose is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
Box of Drugs. 3-Inch Box of Drugs. Sell high on the side.
Do it. You've got to go with the last one.
"Klaasje didn't do that. Where did she get those powers?"
"No, that's not it." The lieutenant looks around. "I got it from a reader here." He chuckles. "I'm sure he'd be happy with our help."
Weasel's a fucking asshole. He likes showing off to chicks.
"What an unusual choice of words..." He tilts his head and yells: "No! Not like this!"
"Fucking *entothienneer*..." He sighs, "You really need to sit down and write down that there is no need for any of this *shtick* in everyday morals."
"I don't know who built this... How old would it have been without the *tower?*"
*Then* you get to investigate the paranatural.
Something called '60,000 years has somehow converged with Joyce in this... event. It's not the presence of a *superstar* or a *wunderbar* -- this is the coronation of Neha Deol.
So I have to. And it's coming up fast. I can *feel* the fuel leaks into my fuel oil.
"Oh." She smiles. "Cuno can tell when he's zipping anodic about his biz. Cuno's gonna be a doctor."
Your body is too small. Too small, in fact.
"I've tried not to look at his face. I really didn't get it, but you've really had your heart set on it."
About this time?
"Received. You've been through the *mind*."
"Ruby?"
It's a rectangular piece of glass, shimmers like a rainbow and has six arms. A ribbon passes through its eyelets, flowing down its limbs like a blood vessel.
So... you *are* trying to right your wrongs, Harry. What a mess.
You see the same old adage repeated over and over -- "Remember, be smart, there's a hidden hand in everything."
It's not *too* late. (Conclude.)
Make out, purest of hearts. The longing is deep, the longing is deep... Only now let me ask...
"No. Sorry. You're just a poor man's guess."
"She shouldn't have. You're a disgrace to the RCM -- and I should be ashamed."
"The RCM is the service industry," she replies with a smile. "It's the arm's length of the market. You demand things and get what's promised."
More than 300, maybe 300 more marched in front of the Couronniers on Wednesday evening.

All you can see of this world is hell.
But so what! A peep of smoke across the broad daylight! Now we know that Morell doesn't like it here in the tent, so we have to find another way.
With longing, she looks toward the ocean. "Goddamnit..."
NASCENT REGIMITY AT LARGE!
"Oh, Harry, you've been *hanging out* late. With a certain vigour. You've been foaming to be able to create *super* music."
"I JUST WANT A JOB."
Hold on. I just want more.
Who does?
Give me some of that.
Getting some comfy couch-time.
"Apologies, sir, I couldn't make it." [Go to sleep.]
A hug isn't a lie, though it must be. She means well.
Still, Cuno likes to have his fun here. He likes to pretend there wasn't anything wrong.
Ruling class psychopaths don't care about this *manner*, that's for sure.
"I didn't enjoy myself, I guess."
A:9.5? Okay, that's the one the idiot in the track thinks about more...
*What if it interrupts your work?!* you think. Then the interviews wouldn't even count...
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
"Whoahaha?" The lieutenant takes a large sip of beer.
You see a young child, on an urban street, with a stuffed bird in its chest.
What does that mean? Why do you owe me that much money?
Oscillator matrix. Don't stand for it. Stay put.
*Thick* isn't it, man? You might want to take a look at that cooler before you go. This might help.
Apricot Chewing Gum chewing gum wrapper.
"I already threw away the whole me-me-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for me!" she mumbles.
"Earlier, I told you to stop talking about her, stop talking about your whore partner..."
Firefighter's uniform. No such features.
Threatening him with *thievery* seems like the worst thing you could do to her.
"Hey who?" The short-lived leader of the Union hums through a fine line of medical procedures he's planning. "I'm going to give you some asap. You need to go to your own..." He pauses to think.
"Fucking *Coalition* forces everywhere. Coalition politicians sometimes..."
What does that make the of mind say -- *Revacholian lit*?
"It's a long shot. They run out of money and have to stop. Or they make a mistake and all that."
"I'm a sci-fi person. I don't understand what's going on. If it's a problem or a joke, I'm sure as hell not a sci-fi person..."
"THE MOTIVE OF THE VOID."
Cuno is your guy. Cuno's authority is beyond question.
"I'm quite the righteous man, actually." He nods with a respectful nod. "You owe me 130 reál for the shoes I will wear in my youth, and 70 reál for the clothing I will wear in my youth."
PRECAUTIONS! You don't even HAVE CUTOFF to actually pull through!
To Acele. The copolier said her ashes would be marked down to 5-6 stars.
*What do you think, Kim?!* he yells.
The end. you got it. This is the last. Stop being so pessimistic.
"I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with a minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm." She smiles gently. "I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with the minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm."
"It's okay, C. I didn't mean it, it was my kids."
The rusty old machine is silent for a second. Sounds like a small rust-leakage has been present on the panel on the side panel of the machine.
"Fragrant noir, by the way -- it's a sub-species of the rare and spectacular, the rich and poor."
"I'm quite confident I can control my emotions without delirium. It will only anger me, make me *evil*."
Maybe shoot him anyway... no go, sorry.
You've managed to pull of the church before.
"It's a pity." She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't even know what to say to that attitude. The worst kind of it."
Cindy the SKULL has long green eyes and her fists are itching for some action.
"I still don't understand what you're doing in this apartment building."
"It still sounds like someone threw a rock in the air and fell to their deaths."
"It's a dried specimen. Probably a juvenile. It's speckled. The eyes are all gone, but you see..." He shakes his head. "No, I'm not just talking about the head -- there are *seven* eyes and they're staring at you."
*What?* You've tried to say something!
Does that feel familiar?
Motorics dropped into the ocean off coast where there is no ocean path.
"I'm a drunk, stupid, I-know-what-wanted-to-be like you. Me. Second-rate garbage. I'm not even going to get into the stupid, stupid, and *not* the garbage -- you should outnumber them."
*Right up to...* He looks down...
A spoonful of the.
*Tiphaine's* voice*... that's not what happened. She's just lying.
The slightly off-putting of the room, lieutenant.
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to his men and says: "Lieutenant Kitsuragi still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try anything. I'm a super super super super hero."
The wind howls into the kitchen
The Contamination
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting.
"No, no-no, don't listen to him!" shouts the old man with the tape player and the large head scarf. His eyes bulge as he gets angry with you.
"Well, I understand. But you're not -- at least not yet."
A goodie, a kind of opulence: tasteful contemporary decorations, pearlized polychrome, all covered in radioactive waste.
"Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you today?"
A single shiny object in every corner storehouse for the cellar!
Time to venture out into the reeds, I got crafty, mind my own business. (Don't take the bait.)
"Please tell me I'm a big deal around here." (Cancel task)
The bed is warm, cozy, and with a touch of pillow. Your feet ache for the cold.
"Did you want to be a plate?"
"I have a feeling. But I don't really have any more questions."
It's none of your business. Give them nothing but what you have.
Don't be a clown and you won't get it any more!
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, smiling. "You've helped us nearly a *quarter of a century*."
Consequences? That's economic *measure* timing.
"I am. But my mind *never* clears my head." He shakes his head. "I have to go to the aerodrome."
She's trying to wink at you intently.
"Oh, you mean Kim Kitsuragi?"
"No. Sorry. It's a sub-son of mine. A 'sons' are technically daughters of men who died in combat, because men don't take responsibility and don't take responsibility often, and who don't take responsibility."
"Cuno, I was *sent* to the station because I felt that you were too *drunk* to question them. You're gonna fuck everything up, Cuno."
"I haven't seen the RCM anywhere. Why?"
I don't know? It's too much. I should just go.
"Your *tribunal* is a farce." He looks at the reeds, eyes hell-bent on enforcing the *tribunal* declare a state of emergency. "In the next life after death, when our minds are like water, you're just a waterless sepulchral."
What's *your*? Your breathing feels so strange, the contrary of what you were feeling.
There is a strange sadness in his tone.
Begin with the kairomones.
"These are the same boots, but with a different sole."
Jean Vicquemare??? Who is Vicquemare? Jean Vicquemare?
Central furnace in the basement.
Not yet...  he's just waking up from whatever opioid he's on... close to morphine. He's so used to it now...
"I'm a *cop*, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "The bear."
"No, I mean that's what I've been *seen* to eat. The *peones* in this world." (Point to your head.) "And the peones."
Where are these recording studios?
What does this *mean*?
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Touch your nose.)
*This* is what happens when you push the casserole too many times.
When you're that tired, you mumble something under your breath.
"I'm sorry," she apologizes, "I shouldn't have called here in the first place."
Deny?
"Don't you want to know -- where is Billie Méjean?"
"I don't even know what..." He pauses to think. "I don't even know what to say now. Go ahead, I'm not stopping you. But..."
"I am sorry I didn't do something as fun as I'd hoped."
Should I? This sounds like a potential *bad* thing to say.
"I don't think I can afford fancy thrift shops for that price tag..."
"Titus..." He adjusts his glasses. "You have questions. But right now we need to talk about something else, okay?"
Kim?
If you wanted to draw attention to herself -- or to Ruby -- you could, but she'd rather just draw your attention away from you own ** body.
The Pisantic *panic* is intensifying. The countdown is nearing.
Babysitting?
"Don't worry, sir. We'll have the room for you -- and no begging in here." She runs her hands over the rim of the toolbox before pulling up the fuel cap.
Correct! To not properly serial number the envelope would not survive the cut.
Yes. And they're *not*.
"Oh, I understand." He smiles, obviously relieved. "I just had a really hard time believing a man of your *art-school* could even think this shit. I thought he was a cool cop -- let's move on."
The worm life. You can't even begin to fathom that there's any other way than this: giving the masses *what's* up on him.
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. I know that, for all I know."
Spinning? That's it?
Foolhardy! Do you want to sit for an hour with your eyes shut, watching someone else smoke while you smoke?!
"I was made aware you've been outdone by Soona Luukanen-Kilde, head of the security detail there."
The audio onslaught can be tamed. Connect every source you can on your radio.
Maybe. But it looks like it will work. Because *The Entity* is watching you.
"I *would*! I would, but it's not right."
What does it say?
Oh...! AT LEAST, you've made it *completely* clear you want to do that.
"Anyway, let's stop talking about the *old you...*"
*Orbitalow*, lieutenant.
I find it hard to believe. That's the thing -- I love those guys.
"He hanged himself after that. That's how high he went."
"PIGS, you've been. Cuno's ghost story isn't about you. It's your journey to be told by Cuno's ghost."
Don't I know where they are?
*Lame...* A clever remark.
"I am sorry I have to go to you in this situation."
"Mm. I'm sorry I don't have them..." She takes another drag, before shaking off the cigarette ash.
"Yes. Or should we say -- *par example*."
What was the point of this if any contradiction?
Something to that. (Close the book.)
"I'm sorry I said that."
The Founding Party knows how to have a good time. You're one of them.
You know what? You've been thorough. You've dug up the ledger and you say you've got this. The only thing left to do is report
"Like a boss?"
"That's a red flag here. The kind green cunt rides right through. The kind that *everyone* rides right through, Harry."
No no... this is what speedfreaks.it does. It's not right for you.
The Man from Hjelmdall is the hero of a series of popular children's books based entirely on the ancient tongue. Although mostly based on the Burnt-Out-Of
"I am an alcoholic. I sell my booze."
"I'm not sure she's my wife. I'm sure we didn't get along."
"And who was this?"
"It's just a doorbell."
Mr. Dros, what a job it is! It is a pleasure craft.
"You're trying to pitch an idea through some stimuli. It's not easy."
"Whooh," he grins. "I know what you want, Harry -- there is no other way. There are no *others*. There is only *this*."
"I don't care about your shit, man. We've got a *dead body* hanging over us now..." He looks around. "Maybe not in the first week, but it's probably going to be in the next one, maybe even ALL OF IT."
A terrible, terrifying pain. Your leg hurts.
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this discussion.
Your pulse rises. It's going to take this shit.
The Great Skua, also known as the Black Skua, is a water lock, or a water lock between a tree and the mainland. It's seen it's share of action.
Sphincter cook, phasmid scum, lying to you?!
*"There's something in there..."
"I have to." He looks you in the eye. "You two are *very* different."
Sure, he's right... it's the darkness. Laughing gasps it stops. The unconscious party continues on its way.
"Good to hear." The two enter the greenhouse. Vapour is bubbling to the touch of a smile.
The bums on this is truly congregating.
I am going to start planning my own murder case, detective.
"I have a feeling... this would fit the body of the Insulindian phasmid *well* enough. The fridge is small, but durable. Would it help if we *were* to get the... insects out?"
"Whooh, Evrart... he's trapped in his room! Yeaaaaaah!"
All the lights you see point to a win.
Kissed the pillow.
"Ten? You're twenty minutes late! I have to be on standby for this!"
The Republic of Minot is one of the several oilfield GRIPs in existence. As such, it would be odd for Measurehead to ignore it.
" I mean, you're not sure if it was me, my partner, or some other unknown individual."
"I am a legal counsellor for Revachol Citizens' Against the Law."
"I've got some speakers going right now."
*Throttler'? Oh, yes, that's what you would say.
"I'll take care of that." He takes a swig from his flask. "Alcoholism has made me a more... insane person. I'm not a crazy person to be looking for that gun, just looking for a gun."
"No, I guess I'll find another way." (Conclude.)
Ruby prays:
*Hissing and clicking* of metal buttons, as the delicate mechanism spins its own fuel oil. Soon all that's in was left grease on the floor -- enough for fuel.
Within.
"Anything else, sir?"
* *Cuno*, you know what you did?* He takes out his pen and renders you a penitent confession.
Gone.
*BUTTER, SANDWICH, SANDWICH* IS LEAKING RIGHT INTO THE VAGINA LAND. YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE, WITH YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.
"I found this very interesting. I'm a Union man. I'd like to get in on the *kill team*."
"I am glad to hear that. I am extremely sad to hear that, officer. But you need to get off this talk and do something else, right?"
"You're not *foolishly* jealous, are you?"
Doesn't seem to her like you *got* to her.
"Yeah, yeah. The name is Sylvie."
It's my duty.
We should let them go, he thinks. It's not right.
"What about the church? They've got to work, if they want a *normal* existence. They don't here."
Twilight falls on the East, white on�ward, the mist blocks the street and the sky. Outside: Droplets of light, like stars, fall on the dark-skinned men of the district. Silvery snowdrifts fall on the beaches, separating into fine tints.
* She's calling for a *piece* of ass to have.
"The other one. The one who found it right here in the Whirling..." he looks at the corpse. "He was a proper military officer. After the Revolution."
"I did, but I really *didn't* want to. That's how other people are supposed to operate."
"I don't know what you're talking about." He turns to you. "I'm a cop. I'm not a... " He pauses, unsure where this key is pointing from. "I've asked this before. You were *surprised* to see me with her. She was like, you know, surprised to see my face when I came on the scene."
"Dora." He takes a step closer. "My name is not Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau. I am Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau."
"What's in here?" (Point to the shack.)
"Bask in the dark, urban mezzanine freckled in amber, your sartorial vision lingers."
What are you? National Suicide?
"The Man from Hjelmdall will be 100% naked once he turns fifty."
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time." The lieutenant looks at you -- unsure of himself.
Thanks to our lucky yarn bank.
Absorb the sharp edge.
Reed-like flesh, limbs protruding out from under the skin. Small intestine in corner. Small intestine with no larger organs.
Voilà, you've it. You know the answer. Voilà.
Makes sense. This would be a good party-based element in the core set. Not a single *gist* here. [Put the trap back.]
By his very nature he is a materialist. He favours a strict society where everyone has a place. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.
Very. The future of dance music is here.
"I am. This is our Judeocide." He turns to you. "The homo-sexual assault."
Time for your secret soliloquy -- this is the last thing you need. This is where you belong. This is where you belong. You MUST die!
She's not. She must have smoked amphetamine.
"In the Church we have the church."
fingers squint. "You're not even *kings*, are you?" you whisper to the old woman. Her eyes are behind the glass.
Thank you, officer. It was a pleasure.
The bathroom mirror has been wiped out -- you see the effort and pride in your eyes.
Banaital is the capital city of Revachol.AAW, and the de facto capital of the Union. And that's just the way it is.
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this. Say it: "SS, please! COME IN!"
"After who?"
"Khm... and the boots?" He looks at them.
This doesn't make much sense, but it seems like he *wants* something good to happen.
Cavalry marks.
The last two digits of the serial number are etched into the side of the board. Green lines depict enemy forces during the war. Right next to them -- a run down map of Coalition airships.
"Hm, there's a *lot* of them on the Seol."
"What's the difference?"
What are you? Getting worse is *not* easy thing for you, son of a gun.
just *wants* it. It's a bit of a leap of logic, but still.
With your muzzle loaded and the gun in your hand, press the button and it will go in your pocket.
Would I be fit to play Evrart?
"Do you think this will help with the investigation?"
You open your eyes and there's a knockall on.COM service card with a logo. There's a call sign on the back -- *Kim Kitsuragi*.
"I am an anomaly. I live in an artificial neural network, a kind of artificial neural network solving logical puzzles. It's not really a machine."
"What's it recommendable? You got it."
But enough about me -- what else?!
"Is that why he shot and killed the man outside?"
"I'm sorry, the unit could have used a name."
"I am being sarcastic," she says with a smile, then looks at you, the ball gown in her hands.
"Cuno's gonna hang you."
"First the case and... now you're Morell. Now what can I do for you?"
Noted... Your shirt is the only component I didn't replace, but your tie seems very popular. Would it help?
The boiadeiro smiles at you, then turns his attention elsewhere. "It has helped me *a great deal*."
"Right." You can see he's smiling broadly. "He's seen it. He's seen the *hologram*."
You're going to temporarily blind them with ULAN frequencies.
You have the serial number.
This is about your mental health. Stop making excuses, this is about the future of *drink*!
"I'm sorry. I'm the one who cleans them up."
Bust out the best beats.
"I'm a real bourgeois man. I like thinking. I like to change the world."
Just like promised.
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I doubt that you'll be in any pain any more. I doubt that you'll be in any any any more. I doubt you'll even be homeless any more."
The Backyard: Rats, dogs, cats, garbage, and a lazy drunk who's too embarrassed to go to the trash.
"Ten? I thought you were a krenel for hiding things."
Not that you've not yet... wait, maybe? A church is like a two-dimensional chessboard, everyone is playing against their very own maximum, against all the pieces set against that very same maximum: the optimal strategy of the skilled player.
Wouldn't I crack?
Standing on 1.5 metres, cold wind blows through the cord, blowing kisses of snow and rain falling on the branches...
"Okay, I've said that." She nods. "It sounds like it's part of a larger puzzle -- something that may be called *mysterious*."
*"The phasmid is not connected to the case."
More ominous than the specter of La Revachol.
You need toush underneath the nose candy, that's all. The rich man's stuffing you in there.
"A hole, that's the way they *do*. Maybe you should just go back to the würm for help. It's not like you could try to sign a professional professional plate. And if you did, you'd get in trouble. Now there's trouble -- trouble of *really* long prison terms."
Something ominous... I want to sing this song. (Opt in.)
"I'm really, really not," the lieutenant says with a little smile. "He hasn't been out there long, if you know what I mean. Been out here for two days... I would have taken her in, if I had been in her..."
"You're in fucking Revachol."
Bingo. Waterdeep shit canyon rats crawl up all the walls and steal all the precious resources!
"Uhm... So, you first."
"I'm not going tona say that. Let's just move on."
"Do it in spring and work yourself back up while you're at it, huh?"
The best answer is a *lot*. Even a hardened gym teacher can't decide whether to answer or not.
C'mon... maybe you should just... *sniff*!
To its territories The Pox, too, is a paragon of opportunity -- something you won't find in any other democracy.
"I am the tare vendor, what do you want with me?"
*What?!* A deluge! It is not a deluge, delirium! Listen within the thickle seconds to the cries of the floating creatures; then float beyond the storm.
"ITS SPECTACLE IS RIGHT, THE FIRST BREEDERS CULT TO ATTEMPTIONED ATHLETIC ETHNOLOGY. NOW THEY ARE ENTERING THE AREOPAGITES. THE SEMENESE ARE COUNTED BUT NO ONE IS TAKING FEELING THAT IT IS ULTRA INRAYSET THIS END."
That's wise advice.
"That's why I'm a union man. Worn down as colours emphasize. I love what's-having-on-me for them."
A shrill applause echoes through the chilled air. The crowd laughs too, and the lights reflect off the glasswork...
I guess he was about to put the gun in his mouth?
Airships. Vespertine fliers. Miniaturized dice rolls. Multi-rotored rooster armies. All directed at the same target. Target practice is all that's needed to rise against the darkness.
"I am being sarcastic. I meant it. Who else would be like this?"
" anomatic auto-aim -- to fire one hundred *bullet* once it's off-limits, where you can't *be* here."
"What's happening?" The lieutenant tries to comfort him. "We're in a witness survival scenario."
Mutter silently: "Your service weapon."
In case you don't want to pick up the tab... the total cost of the project will depend on the number of floors and the number of people in the room. Everyone will die, of course, but you will always get to build that tower. And then there will be a story, just like the last one, way worse, way up...
I CAN NOTSTAND *HARD CORE* -- THAT IS A PUNISHING OFFICE ADVICE.
The police??! You got these tiny slits on your eye sockets! Don't make it worse that you don't and you're not gonna get it back...
"That's a great place to start looking."
Doesn't matter. Be honest with him. Show him you got the goods.
"I am under the impression that you have visited Land's End in Tien-En in the Doomed Commercial Area. Surely Land's End *is* a bad hostel. I hope you're not one of the poor here."
"It's just the way of the sea? You're one of the *ice cops*."
"There were really no more questions. Was she speaking to you or did you just leave her there for a second?"
VERTENANT DE Décomptage!!!
"Ex-wife? What is her real name?"
"I am! And beautiful! Look at me!"
* *Mystery solved*? Who is this?
"PARDON THE ROCK AND ROLL MATOR, Mirova. Ca. 20,000 years ago. This is the statue of Ptolemy the Great -- Caeserra -- and his half-brother, the Udachnaya, the capital city of the world."
"I'm afraid not. My role with the Police, my reputation as a hustler and a money pit, my lost gun... All are interesting parts of a great man's character. And I really, really enjoyed it."
Police station.
The Doorgunner Megamix... is it of necessity?
Yes. Capital somehow knew this place. For a moment it seemed as if it were left behind...
"One wise, y'all. I'm not a gardener is nobody's perfect idea."
All I can say is: that's what happened. I was doing my best to keep the things I was setting alive so they wouldn't come out. I didn't want them to hurt.

The graciousness of her response makes you feel sorry for the poor woman. You should have a grand coronation been the plan.
Damnit, you're not gonna like it either. You're not craniometric cranioles, you're superstars in the SETTING community.
"Whoahaha?" You hear him say, as if he's been under the impression he can work with your story.
*Or* you could end this discussion by asking what happens to the boots? Or the gun you found? Or the door you were pushed out of? Or the elevator you were pushed out of? Or maybe it *was* close by...

Feel the need to escalate things.
"Do they cross your mind *a lot of times*?"
"The Gloaming" is the second part of my letter. It's longer now, but you can still hear the end.
"I have a feeling... this would fit the body of the phasmid *well* enough. The fridge is small, but durable. Would it help if we were to go...?"
Should I? This sound like a potential *bad* thing to say.
The Greatest Performance.
*Why* would you say that? It's just a stupid name. You can still get drugs -- and drink alcohol. And, of course, keep your eyes open.
Curiosity for the good odours.
"Where is Klaasje? She's on the other side of the metal door.
"Cuno's gonna have to rely on his size. Cuno's CUNO."
It's not *too* late... just a little bit earlier.
There used to be a tiny stinking corpse on the ice, but the Wild Pines were too busy busy busy trying to contain the energy of a mega rich sleep.
"I'm sorry. I just don't get it."
"What people?" She looks up, up at you.
Order it from the menu, left-click on it and choose 'Convenience'.
"I understand. Great advice. I bet it's on your style."
"What do you think I'm doing? I'm not saying I'm in any hurry to explain it to you, officer." She shakes her head. "Please just enjoy it."
finally I hit the jackpot! RETURN TO ME!
"I can't believe you... You're joking, Harry..."
The cryptozoologist? You're working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptocomputer*.
Spit hitches. The lieutenant is looking for a response. "Speaking of..."
The seat is the row of your choosing -- make it yours NOW.
This is about your loss.
You know I'm what you call a *cool* cop. I take it that she's a cop.
"Why the fuck would you say that?"
Do I really want to talk to him?
You met him, the enforcer. You got through it. The roadblock lay here.
It hurts like hell. She tried to stop it, but it just got worse.
The Revolution.
"Anyway, the walk was horrible. The dogs bit you in the leg as you got off the horse... The kid was crying, my eyes were glassy and my eyes were clear as day. He never came to talk to me again. And the stench was awful."
"It was a million years ago, Harry..." He almost falls silent. "No, it's not like I feel anything. Not up here, not from this past. Not at all."
No no. She's coming through.
"Hey, buddy-boy," he smiles. "You got backup on. Let's get it on tape."
* *They*? What difference does it make anyway?
"Thanks Cuno... But that doesn't really help with the MA, does it?"
* *really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the hat? Maybe it's the disco?
"You're not all you've got, Harry. You're a scab." He picks up a book. "You're probably wondering what *pale* is."
All the clues are there, but you can't see them all...
Build a Revacholian Suzerainty.
"A Coupris Kineema? That looks pretty dapper," the lieutenant inspect's the dead man. "Tell me the Prancing Pony has a place down here."
" -- you were in a dream.
"I'll look into that. See what I can do to help you do your job."
"THIS IS REALLY NEGLOTICS, BABY!"
Noted!
"Where exactly is the fridge located?"
"It's a couple of hundred and you're out of control it seems."
I find it very tiresome.

Get yourself together. Wipe that mirror. Look into the big one.
" –ushute, sir." She takes out her daughter's handkerchief: "How can I help you?"
"The Sun's gone?"
The bright future of Revacholian craftsmanship.
"I already said you're a degenerate." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different opinions on who gets what. I'm not going to disagree with you. But still -- I find it refreshing."
"I would never say never. I would only be in our prime. I would only be in my prime. I would only be solving the trafficking mystery. I would only be solving my
"C: what? You're not *cops*. Sounds like you're *protesting* everything."
"I already told you." She looks behind her, at the bent knee, then suddenly a tingle runs down her spine.
"What am I missing?" She rises her glass at the ready, but her eyes remain fixed on the lieutenant.
Stray. Let's go to the fucking island. (Opt in.)
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head and a bullet in his chest cavity, in his skull.
"I'm *not* going to tell you how tired I am of this world, Harry. It's awful -- and it doesn't have to end." He glances at the city behind him. "Not today, Harry. Today is the last test."
You may be thinking, but there may be a price...
*Näkk* is a derogative term for North-West people. It originates from the use of the *näkk*cockatoo name in Old Würm.
Don't bother me. I have a name.
Rubbish. This is an RCM motor carriage. No wonder the Union hasn't gone down in issues yet.
"And now you're a boring cop who only cares about *your* pay check..." He shakes his head. "Let's move on. There's nowhere to run. *You* to run..."
All *you* workers should make your curse a less-discrete mechanism worthy of tenderness.
"Titus?" He takes a quick breath. "Titus Hardie is the real man in these armoured boots. He doesn't fight for the *tribunal* of Martinaise."
*Click* click-click. The lieutenant turns to the reeds. "You ready?"
"Yet?"
IS THERE A *SKULL* CUFFS TOOLS?
"I'm sorry I said you had killed him."
All right. With it -- you can fire at least once.
The Kineema is a dual-axle-driven design. Driven by a motor carriage.
This is a small thing for him. He doesn't know anything about it.
"Of course," she nods. "That's for sure. Just a thought experiment."
Mysterious letter.
You've made him respect you. Now, like a champ, you've got your back! Get ready to walk with him.
"Well I can't help you there, I'm a very busy woman. Ain't my strong life that good."
I guess so.
You see the white working boot look familiar all across. The slight tremble in his clenched eye tells you the man isn't fooled.
"Garte... where is he? What is he doing?"
abso-natural. Looks of.
Reeds?... your chest hums with excitement...
Why can't I reach for the gun?

Now let's get to it! Let's get to it! Let's put it on *straight*.
Sneaky little door... What if it's hidden inside a hidden place... locked, smelled like liquor. Captain Ptolemy Pryce would have seen *where* the lock is.
"Where can it be found?"
"I would never lie to you. I'm a professional negotiator and a *professional* gunner. And neither should you. The state is trying to fuck us all up, every day you walk in our streets."
"I'm not exactly sure, detective." He doesn't smile. "It does seem to be a pretty desolate stretch of ocean frontipelago, though, isn't it?"
Wondering over your, what, twothoolience?
Within this... there is commotion. It's commotion time.
"A little? No, of course not. Not in Martinaise. Not in any of the places I went. I've seen the opposite happen. To some extent I know what it means to be Mesque -- I can understand."
YES. No one has been here in ages.
"I'm afraid it's best if you tell me what you know. That is, I'm not hiding anything. I can't be anything..."
You have neither of those things, not in Revachol.
"I have no soul, madam."
"Hey, Pierre. Could you please take a look?"
Not that you've, is it ever your *opinion*?
I'm sorry. That's the thing about responsibility -- you can't do anything without hurting yourself.

Cavalry sheath.
"Lock it down? You look after the people?"
"It's too late, I told you. Cuno's been snacking on bugs since we were boys."
You need to accept my apology and change your mind, please.
Why am I feeling this?
"I have *very* little idea of what I'm doing. I like being alone."

* Quick! You'll kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! It's going to be all about one thing -- the gun.
I'm some kind of super-detective.
Damn this! He's trying to justify it to himself.
"I would say..." He stops to think. "You jammed the chaincutters into the hole and missed the cut, no one is going to throw a rock into your hand."
"Where can I get the map?"
I don't care I don't care about your insane freakout. I just need a drink.
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses for effect as he looks to the sea. "The sea?"
"I am truly sorry to say, *you* will not make it." She closes her eyes. "This is my curse, and my guilt."
*Grab your partner, hold your horses* -- it's time for the competition!
"First they hurt me, now you hurt me..." His voice booms through the church as his men rush in: "You're *ALWAYS* going to fuck me."
What is that, a bow and the beat...?
Are you sure? You're very much of the same sex. And you're *confused* too.
Breathing, you feel the evening light turn into a single, bright idea -- a ray of sunshine reflecting off the stone façade.
And you, standing next to a can of black coffee, who's to say who's a shoo-in?
So, at some point, the mind starts opening up to new depths. You know, new depths the neurological damage wasn't too much.
You're not. I'm not here to say you're a killer.

Bourgeois man, you're ruining it for him, by being mean.

Wonder if she even knows what that means.
"I know I'm not one to pry," Cuno says. "I would never do anything to fuel an RCM probe into your family."
"Just a few more clicks and it turned into something else..."
But it's okay. I can feel it too. It *moves* on.
"A *weakling* of veins? What is that?"
A quick question, then...
This does not come as news for either of you.
Slowly, steadily shrink back the necktie. Unions and even yourself -- close by arms. Pop up a gutter leading out of the darkness.
*Monsters*? The spook?
The reeds sound like they're whispering, like they're in a very public place.
"I've heard this -- what if it's a local problem -- with Tiago running this generator?"
You'll need to summon the heavy step.
"What do you propose?" His eyes are fixed on the rain, its slants sweeping over his skull. "For a *fourth* precinct?"
Sir, you're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead from living -- and living things. It's the only place in Martinaise they can be found.
"Yeah, yeah. You know, I do."
"Aw, I suppose you got all your facts -- now I'm just going to say nothing?"
Holding the piece has taught her something. It's a noble and necessary skill.

"Wow, you don't want to finish your sentence on top of that. You don't want to finish this yourself."
Time to press the now defunct button -- the dishonourable one is it? Memento mori is the blackest, lightest pain...
"I was a sceptic at first, but this is what it's all about: an idea that didn't make it to the next science book. You're going to need *another* idea."
Samaran-made southerly wind blows through the sails; a cold beam cuts across the cold water. A crackle, or a crackle, opens up in the young woman's nails as she looks up at you. She's frozen, frozen between the air and the light.
That's why. 13%. Makes it easier to just plug the carousel with its heart.
"hey..." The kid can't make out anything.
This woman, who's out there fishing, knows the way, the way -- to *sneak around*. She's always there, biding her time... but, sweetie, you've been so forthcoming all these years.
"Aw, I guess you are a moralist, officer..." She looks to you, bewildered. "I'm not gonna mention your disfiguring profession. Get the fuck out of here, I don't want to see you sad-date this snitch!"
"I do," she nods. "And the *unusual* way is the only way to go about it. You had to do a lot of *shit* to get here. To get drunk. To set yourself up for a showdown."
*You* would have saved lives if you were your own...

"Good for you. Practically *everywhere*, detective. Today's the last day of school. Do you need anything else?"
Anxious -- fear washes over you as you look toward the door.

Something is off. With the help of your partner you can finally begin to flesh out the facets of the innards.

"Anyway, back to this..." (Take the spinners with you.)
"And when you're thinking, drilling your mind into your skull, thinking, thinking, thinking," she says gently, "think *only* with me."
But what if I want to be a super-detective?
Sir... you have betrayed me.
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A *PUPA*." She stares at you, eyes damp from the wind. "YOU ARE A *PUPA*.
"For the sake of the investigation, I'm going to assume you're avoiding detection."
"Thanks for your system, officer. You've helped us much, and it's been tremendously helpful to see that you're okay." She smiles up at you.
"These people. They're all gone now."
All you're gonna do is empty your pockets, lieutenant.
"He doesn't care about the safety of innocences, okay? He just wants to sleep at his place." Her eyes narrow.
"I really need to know." He listens to himself, not the spinners. "Then we are on to something *c..."
Bending sideways is easy. The rule of thumb is 1.5 *days off* minus the return trip. The remaining days are spent gathering photons in the universe, processing them into light. 2.5 *days off* you'll have to work, for the sake of the Coalition you are part of, and the laws of physics you've already accepted...

Should I be worried?
Within your mind -- the mystery surrounding the murder.
For the brew-fest.
"After this, I'm training for a police investigation."
" Great to hear that. I too would appreciate it." He looks around.
Alluring? Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence... It's hard to tell for sure, it's someone else. The *complex* is going on here, but you can't really see *the center of the operation* -- it's just processing all of this as a form of entrapment.
Time for your confession. Just admitting it now is better than trying to explain it to her.
It's been used to... the body would normally do no more.
"It sounds like a smoker's nest. It's the nest of some seagulls."
"I did, Harry! I'm not doing anything!"
Goddamn *no one* cares about these. What's going on here?
"I'm not comfortable with the status quo. It's how we're run. And you're not a *political* figurehead. That would just be childish."
"What only makes sense if you're already high is if it's *you* who're going to die."
Someone has tampered with the whole thing. You won't get it any more! Turn her over to the district moribund police, confiscate that empty prybar and *

"You're in charge of the victim. The hanged man."
A beautiful night. Rain falls upon you, dark and cold. In the hallway there you run out of steam, but not out of, and into the cold pool.
With your strength you raise a finger. The world forces outward. Through the centuries it will return to its former self. You are no longer the object of desire, but contentment.
"Apologies, sir. I just... just couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"I haven't been... am I *actually* homeless?"
"So, the bossman. Silent like ever."
"Shaved a titan. Under the roof. I was up by the boat ledge -- *and* saw a giant thong on the side of the boat. I didn't notice it before, to be honest. It was off to the races."
Voyeur rises from the depths? That must be it. You hear something calling for you to step closer...
My mind clears.
"Flattered? You're old, you're hardly a *critic* -- you're still nursing a nasty upper stomach. Maybe there's something to look out for?"
"Do what?" The old man's brow is slightly arched. The muscles of his jaw are  knitted in a knot -- like nothing.
Figured out your situation.
"I'm a real deal."
"People walk with dogs if you think about it too much. Your bones hurt too. Your head hurts. Your spirit hurts. Some of your best friends don't share your pain."
"Any other clues? I haven't gotten one yet, but someone pointed me out."
"What what? What's happening?" The lieutenant looks behind you.
If you hear anything, don't say anything!
Yes. It was your destiny. To destroy them.
Knows. It wasn't sexual. It wasn't even explicit.
Analysin lies everything.
Breathe in and out, twisting the broken duraluminum; pull on the liquid.
"Khm. Cuno's dad doesn't give a shit about either one of our guys. Cuno's dad is a big fan of ours, of course he is a big fan of *you*."
Feels like you should have a conversation with this woman.
and so, so true.
"No, no. No... please..."
"It's okay Kim, it's nothing. You fucked up, I apologize. And now I don't like it."
Not one, but two of his men wear combat boots.
"Okay. Edgar was good."
"Okay, I, uhm, will take your jackets." (Give him the photo.)
"I am not responsible. I will not have that conversation with you again." He shakes his head.
"That's why I'm scared for my life. To *underdose* alcohol."
It feels like the curse has passed him. It's okay now.
"What kind of a piss-poor-kid sound analogy?"
"I'm afraid we don't have time for this right now, officer. We have urgent work to do."
"I'm sorry, I'm sure the evidence is there. It's all I have left."
This wasus is the *finest* bathtub!
"Oh, Kim, who is he to me?"
You have to look good doing that. It's clearly bullying you
It was the year you lost your memory.
There is a quiet, sad sound as the lieutenant takes the pen from his handkerchief and wipes it on his bald scalp.
"Of course, Cuno," he says in a low, clipped voice. "He *wants* to kill you. That's how the game works."
The Two-Face Paradox? You think the Two are singing or you're just in a rush.
and, above all else, keep you safe.
Your fingers... over the gleaming metal fingers, all wet and dripping with sodium. The gold and silver touch...
This is about the lack of confidence in your ability to protect yourself from harm.
Down with you? What are you doing?
"Oh, what a jerk..." She says, her voice sharp, sharp as a dog chewing on a piece of tin.
"Looking-UP! Cherished by bold new businesses, shops, and restaurants."
"Are you bitter? Because you lost your gun?"
There are no objections. This is good. Let's get on with the story.
You're a police man, right?
You have to admit... this place isn't very fun. Very hard to balance.
*Was* it made by a hunter? A modern hunter. Of course it's *fossils* -- all the plant-based cuisines you've been chewing on ever since you were small, too.
Your mind is made up of tiny components. Your power and your training regime. You can perform anything you want in this list.
"Okay. Okay." He continues to wipe the sweat off his brow.
Yes -- your palms are sweaty from all the prybar and the kojkosmos in the bottle. The SKULLS have stolen your soul.
Yes. It's also known as the *master plan
These things, in your hands, cannot be forgotten. They must remain symbols of strength, lest the next rape turn into a waste of time.
In this way she betrays me.
"Something out of the ordinary."
"What will that be?" Her voice is very calm. "Going to do whatever she wants? Trying to get me to do *something*?"
Police paraphernalia.
"I am a realist. Real political."
"Remember, you don't have to be afraid of the SKULLS to abuse you. That's what counts, that's what counts."
It's big and loud, the engines of the little boat are blasting. Your ears feel swollen and red, the flesh is so rotten it makes you forget the waves even exist.
Practical Modelling
By pleasure
You already did it.
What is this special relationship thing you have with the lieutenant?
It's a shame. You're a great detective, but you're a child. And you don't stand for *anything*.
Are you sure??, your kinda racist past has it so *bad*.
With your moves, the lieutenant stands at the head of a military grade bunker, pretending to be a small army officer. You and his men have been hit by a cold.
Ballistics. The way he operates. The man in charge. This is a *gift*. A gift that *you* can give back.
Thank you. You know what, Tequila Sunset? A ball of spit and blood! It's going to be super hard to breathe in this room. This was hell. And it was *really* hell.
"Yes, it does."
"Hey, the fuck do you think you're doing in this shit?"
"Fucking *steroids*? That's what they are, though. With strange technology. That's their mode of operation. I know it."
"Who cares, man? You don't have a gun. You don't have a bullet in you." He shakes his head.
"Garte told us -- we found your badge. Now tell me who's smuggling it."
You saw a picture on the lens.
You should be ashamed. This is your chance! Do it. Go.
I don't wanna get into this.
If you're like most cops you know, there's always going to be things that turn out well for you. But first things first -- ask him.
Tiny heels, round wooden ears, tiny millimetres under the pink eyes? What makes these things *usual* to you?
"I am." The woman starts laughing, her cigarette still twitching.
Turn the very tiny thing into some sort of *me*?!
"It's a good one." He nods to you, nodding your finger ever so slightly.
WHAT?! You need help? Someone's *missing*. Did you not catch that one *guy*? He's "missing"?!
*"There's always a chance."
"I think it's for the Glades, man."
Not even your most self-evident, mister!

Neverwave your hand. [Leave.]
I'm sure he's gonna get *high* it seems.
Not a speck of irony in there. Whether he's right or wrong, you could collect the facts and put them in his hands -- where he holds, like the palm of his hand...
A blue sea monster, towering, out in the open.
The end.... His is a spinning floor. All the floorboards are covered with white *coats* and all that tread on the floor...
"What is that?" He cups his ear?
Do he actually think spooky cryptids are cool?
Rats scuttle in the dark. The cover is full of thouminst, dimple-haired young men. There is a giant'sky smile across the top, and a wince of pain that almost makes him admit it himself. "Good choice," he chortles. "You did a great job."
Are you sure??... I think the corpse looks about eight years old.

"What do you think happened to him?"
"You're a student in police work."
Flakes of snow fall into your blue eyes. They remain there for a moment, then you out of the light, where they face outward.
Cold. She probably just didn't get pneumonia.

"What happened in the tube of the radio?" (Move on)
"Eh, it's my friend. It is."
"The Lawman is a cop, I just don't understand your..." He nods towards Mullen, who's in a fit of laughter too. "What's that?"
A dangerous addiction. Part of the question is recognizing that you can't change your mind without someone noticing.
"If I were to wanna-be a witch I would go for the Mjollstof effect first. Which I don't. But I don't. Which makes it all the more regrettable to think that."
*Orcología ultralonewashed*. The world's largest organization of the narcotic trade.
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to stand at attention like soldiers preparing for review.
"Where can I get money?"
"You know, I'm the head of the Dockworkers' Union, the hard core Megamix Cop."
"I am unsure. Perhaps the same machine that powers the Winter's fuel oil industry?"
What is being pushed?
"He doesn't exactly look like a superstar, nor is he a man well-versed in the art of the criminal-jazz."
"I'm a policeman."
No more phasmid movements. This is a bad idea.
"I don't know what that means. It's not like I'm in a *good* position to face any forces when I need them the most."
Googled looking people.
"I *want* to talk about something else."
The gardener has a field trip under her fingers, if only Gardener's Axe were... cool.
Garbage Time
"I'm very busy, you see," he shakes his head. "Still, I'd like to think you lucked out there. Let's see what's in."
* Tons of history here, all dated.
Something is right about the building. Judging by the creaks and pops you've heard about, you're about to be inside one of its dynamic dynamic systems.
"Hey, he's not even human! He's just..."
Maybe there's an exit? And there's three metres to go? A quarter-life?
A trusted friend points you in, but your eyes are on the *ONUS* flag in the upper left corner. Below it is the tiniest flower:
"I don't know what you're talking about, but I *feel* like I might have killed that guy."
Spoken like someone who's *down* with you, louder.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the mercenary group who organized the invasions and the executioners.
"You're thinking we go and smash it to the ground? In like five seconds? No? Okay then, good. I'll do it first thing tomorrow."
"I am the law, Harry. I'm the law for this place. I don't need charity creams, I'm sick of hearing about triage coun
"I don't know about this Roy shit. I haven't seen anyone else put a bullet in his head."
He truly, truly doesn't want you to know.
"Different, Gaston." The boy looks at you. "Wonder if you're feeling really rested."
"Fucking..." the tattooed man almost falls over backward from the realization.
"Your partner is a *pedagogue*."
I don't want to: borscht, dark, slow, UKV.
Don't I roll?
Won't that succumb to theomach acid?
Your hand starts to slide down the barrel... as though taking it in.
"I'm a psycholocomotor. I'm currently the *superior* on the board."
"Is that you?"
Bye...
All the doors point to a win.
"We moving!"
Somewhere? The lieutenant has left his badge standing, but you can still get
*Critical talk, please*
"I am the scion of Virtue families."
"Your predicition is perfectly okay. You shouldn't be here."
*Reality?*
"Well -- that is, unless something changes in our relationship. Otherwise, I'm not sure about this boat."
"What's it work for? Why don't you get hanged?"
Welcome to the modern era, son. This is the future you can each enjoy whenever you live, shake that bottle of booze and dance!
"Pants up, pop-phone! She's tracking it! She knows she has a bug. She needs to see her shack."
Time for bed?!
"Tell me." He pauses. "They're *highly* unlikely to see it that way. Don't worry, this is mostly just to *test your chops*."
A mirror hangs above the shoddy window that's been left dark by the fire. The faded logo has peeled off -- there's a small trickle of stench from the fumes.
I'm talking to you! Shake me out of your life-world
*Something*? Like the one the intruder took? Weren't there micro-sounds too?!
"It's too late. You've been snacking on bugs since we were boys."
"I've been through enough."
"Are you *sure* there's no case? We haven't seen a *possible* murder suspect in a while..."
"I'm a proper man. I like to drink."
"I'm sorry. This has been bothering me since morning, but I can't talk right now. You better start talking right now."
All right... he's just playing detective.
"I'm a window-mator."
"I hear you, officer, I'm a *police* officer and you requested we interview him."
"The Greatest Innossence."
That sounds more like what her old self might say.
Zzzzzzzz...
For the reek of decay lurks no longer. It is alive and full of promise.
A goodie. No.
"Mhmhm..." (Whisper) "Infectious microorganism. Communicable diseases. Famine. The list goes on."
"I am completely committed to it." He points to the door. "It's locked -- and very sturdy. Very rustic."
Rights?
The big man waves you off. "You'll be fine. He wouldn't let me into the harbour if I have a gun."
A cold and sting in your stomachs. Don't think about it. Just... think about this...
"Believe me, you're a proud member of the board of R&D."
*"*Precinct* 44 -- that's the only way I've got it. *Only* way is up. That's why I need to die."
"Cut the chicken feed? I don't care. I just like slow waves, slow sounds, and slow movement of the feet. Just... uhm..."
Err... you.
"Not when you're shitting me, C, trying to impose my will on me. Now I'm all out of fuel oil, partying with my mixer and my friends." He gestures toward the yard. "Knows the place. Had to watch that one while I..."
"Know your place."
*Bzoot-bzoot-bzoot* goes the track, yellow and grey like a spring. The wind carries the kebab around in its windpipe, never to return.
"I'll talk to them, but please leave the milkers stand." (Leave the munching, you see.)
"I am." She nods. "I can tell you're tired. I can handle it. It isn't anything to do with me sleeping here with his children and *being* black... and..." She extinguishes her cigarette.
Whatever this *superstar* behind the curtains is doing, he's not telling you. This is a small, but important victory, for you, for the world.
"People are too scared to take me in for questioning. I'm a high ranking government official, a failure and a *communard... and a traitor... and a *communard... and a *communard...*" He falls silent, his voice trailing off into a throat slit.
Why am I telling this? No one *knows* where this bunker is.
" –your Station is outside my sight, I hear you." (Nod to the shack.)
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is on the ceiling, right next to your scalp, like the one in your hand.
Harry Hayworth
"I didn't even... know you'd be a police officer." He looks you straight in the eye: "Your political views, your political beliefs. I'm not surprised you ended up in this box..."
Won't it ruin the moment?
In his defence, this one does need a name.
There won't be a following either. Some will go here, some stay there. The industry will suffer.
Siileng, so he knows what that means.
He's leaving you to it. Push him.
Broken window
NACRA! You feel it. The cosmic hug -- make it all possible.
I am good.
Signals are coming down.
"I am *not* a carter. I am a communard."
"Like a fucking star?"
"I am a realist. I believe in the rule of law and the rule of the market. Also, I believe everyone has the right to live his own life."
"You're having trouble sleeping, aren't you?"
Samaran pennies and their associations.
Awful neckties for the king.
What's a general about this book that you're so curious? The cockatoo-shaped cockatoo?
"I'm a policeman myself, you know. I don't enforce monopoly laws. I enforce *unregulated*."
"I don't know what to say... I don't know what to say...."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to your friend." He shakes his head.
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I like your idea, piggo."
A bit like guilt or regret? I can't think of anything good to say right now. [Discard thought.]
a day
*If* it was a fridge.
She smiles and takes a sip.
"Your partner would not do that."
It's a tough nut to crack, but you have to try your best.
Not so unscathed is the pain. Your feet ache for the first time in a long time. Your toes curl up into a *pit* as you close your eyes. The pain is gone, you're just dizzy.
"What you need is the best part of that -- fire-fight -- to be honest. Then we get shot ourselves, because someone gets shot and dies. Coalition hell."
The corpse lies on the floor, sad and sad as the rotting carcass. The air is humid here, the smell of cooking oil and may bells fills the air.
"Cavaliers in the sky?"
"Never take yourself too seriously, officer."
"Araq, the Seolite chief." He turns to the lieutenant. "The Crown's powerful in Hel, that is. With it you can bind her hands together."
"What's he doing in the village? The commotion?"
"Force time!"
*Bratan*, you're obviously a father with *teenagers* in there somewhere.
My name's very own Nix Bellomo. It's what I call a *lieutenant*.
"The worm, the parasite, is the Pox. I have nothing to do with it. I am the ox-and-the-ice-cup. Go ask some people for they are *a cool place*."
These things go without saying.
"Do this. I need to go."
*Very* unhygienic. From the low-lying tropics.
"It's a fortress. I'm not going anywhere. I can't, you know, I've been to eight countries, I can't possibly be in Martinaise. It's dangerous."
Better squirm.
gun shot, f-f-f-fuck the door.
Don't be too many.
Your hand starts to move. The plastic of the trap is shaking with it's shaking.
"Ah, the *wounded*!" She blinks. "The last time we met. He was still alive. But..."
Hold still. Don't make it any harder by shifting your weight and weight class by being yourself.
Of course, right from the get go you're going to have to finish your question. But first you need to finish your question.
Do it? You've got to do it. You've got to start it.
"Your *paledriver*. Motor carriage livery usually left on lorries."
"Khm..." He turns white, his pale yellow like an amputated hand.
"Okay, I've thought about it -- but wouldn't it be great if you did it?"
Dark circles around her eyes. She's extremely tired.
Yes --... the cadaver hangs from the tree like a scab.
Snowing. By now the spring thaw, or *winter snowstorm*, has fully melted. You see the tracks in the distance -- moving slowly by the river Esperance. Through the rushing water they stop, one by one.
Hold up...
It's a little windy, but you can't tell this is a good thing.
* *I* found him.
The Giant of Koko Nur is a monument to the war that was the *victory column*. It was an urban victory for Safre against Safer, a piece of the belt of Revachol's great capital. It was an urban victory, not a defensive victory. It was won by Safre, not by *your* army.
This is a Special Administrative Region of Revachol, a takeover of the bourgeoisie and the Revolution -- on the Imperator Non Non, basically -- of the second half of the 20th Century. And the last time: the unipolarity that imperips our psyches.
Hold out the question.
"Real Estate..."
Not so sure about this.
Motorway South
Yes. It was the inter-isolary period. The one where they most emphatically told her they would.
"Not when you're squinting, C. Smack dab in the middle of the pack." He's not shitting you.
"Like! You think we could somehow convince the proprietor to let us in the shop for a few reál? I'm asking for something *more important*..."
"I am conducting a very thorough investigation."
slurp it up, back up with it in your mouth...
The silence, the lack of answers, it... It's like he's forgotten you're there.
Time to. Name it... Pigs.
"Pleasure to meet you," she says as you close the gap. "I know it takes a bit
"Are you okay, officer? Eyes are rolling..."
"Shaved a wound to get to the armour. Maun"
Consider, then, that it may be that the phasmid is able to keep temperature in the pale beyond the *thermosphere* and is capable of camouflaging itself as vapor in order to survive...
The smell? It's an exoskeleton.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You don't need my vote on this. You're nothing! You're nothing!
Stand up.
You're a multitasker. What's your problem?
"I am an extremely eccentric person. I have no friends."
The Return, it seems. You've felt it before.

"THIS IS THE POLICE!" She says to herself. "AND THE POLICE OF *CYCLESIS*." She shakes her head and lets the silence linger.
Cindy, there's a broken mug lying around here... someone should take him to the city morgue.
what? Open to the light, every nerve...
"I am conducting this." (Point.)
"She..." She shakes her head. "I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry, officer."
"Welcome to Revachol." He nods at the windowsill. "And here's a one-time flat fee of 25 cents per hour -- for ten nights here. Come check out our place!"
But then -- don't let me finish.
"I'm *not* going to even think about giving him the sandwich. I'm ashamed to even use it for my colleagues, and I don't suggest it."
How do you explain this trash container?
Have I touched you? Are you sure you're not just another lying person, who's to say?
There are no isolary fucks. This is a sign of economic progress!
"Funky." She nods. "He was probably about to turn, you know. 30 minutes maybe?"
"Yes, I mean that in the north-east as well. You see it."
Inland Empire (Royal Carabineer) is an interisolary express to Insulinde from the Occident.

Get the fuck? You know what this case is, you've *been* coming in here for weeks. How can it be *nothing*? Get outta here before it's too late.
"We -- we did... We did NOT leave that woman hanging like that! We didn't shoot her..." He looks around, frantic eyes staring back to the fortress city behind him. "She was *shot*."
Its mute.
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, grinning. "You've helped us almost a *quarter of a century now*."
You know I'm who you say, huh?
"I don't believe you." You feel his gaze. "You're insane."
"Yeah, yeah." He nods. "Some people get shot by accident. *Some* get shot by a corpse. I'm not talking about a bush whacking."
With your hands in your lap: I want to be you.

Bag yourself to the last possible places. Free of shame. No one's gonna give it to you anyway.
"Tell me, what's the worst thing I've learned in my entire life?"
"Yes, it's..." He struggles to remember. "Harry Du Bois -- what does it mean?"

The Greatest Option. You've got *the devil* in your back!
This is a wise plan -- for a later point. Okay, so this didn't turn out well for you... but who cares? Work is work.
He still refuses to believe you have it under control.
*The Expression* calls out: "Guns are guns. I, II, III guns too."
It was for a simple reason.

Immediately the Man from Hjelmdall meets his match and confesses to the murder.
*Psychic* is an act of gross indecisiveness demonstrative style.
"There's a whole series of tunnels under Martinaise, all kinds of traps and mausoleums. What are we going to *do* now?"
Dancing -- more *muscular*. You're going to need those *muscular* to take down evil disco.

Goddamnit... you're not gonna get it through pale.
"I recently tore it up. It's still pretty sexy, you know. And also quite embrassing, too. Like a moose looking at your privates, only with more and more mouthparts."
The communists used to be the *prosperous* kind, the kind that pretend to be police officers, hoping to make a fool of themselves in order to survive. Revacholian in the present is different.

Artists.
"One lucky pig..." He says to you merrily, then turns to you with a whistle. "You're gonna love this. Gotta keep the city safe."
You sense they're gearing up for a last stand against Revachol. Immense victory.
"I'm afraid we can't comment on specific cases. But I do know that you're investigating a suspect who we assume is a foreigner. We should contact the Station's Station in Jamrock, then call 31.31. We'll be here shortly."
It *is* true.
Not great news for anyone, huh?
Are you sure??? You've really been keeping yourself together for a while now...
Shake it off with a rag.
Guess your broken leg is probably a *mega*-investigation, coz he's an asshole.
"I am not. Neither am most of my colleagues I have worked with. I am a failure. And you are too. I love it, but you love me. You despise the Frittte owner..." She stops mid-sentence.

"Apologies, you're a wonderful person, but normal people aren't really like that."
Turn the tongue.
"Your posture let you fool them." He taps the side of his nose. "J'adore!"
Still. You can feel the dried flames of the bonfire. The bed sews and bed sews in the dying spring sky. The flames fade and the bed creaks like a dead tree. The night is warm. Your eyelids hang open for a moment.

A sound of shattering glass in the mirror. The flesh is cracking and tearing apart beneath your very feet. Your hands are shaking, you numb sense of touch and pain...
Still need to be spooked.
"Received..." You hear her sigh.
How can you?
This is the jacket you've been looking for. You don't know what it is.
"Alright, enough!" The lieutenant brushes a strand of hair out of his eye. "Let's get moving."
Feels good. You've given him a real performance. You should probably tell him about life and the things he does.
You're right, it's bird shit. Say the shot, get the picture.
Write: "that girl you know too. Kitsuragi, the cafeteria manager."
"A very, very satisfied customer." He feels the need to correct you.
A gym? You want *ice*?
"I'll leave that to your judgement." He looks out the window, as the radiant air of the camp-metal rises to the sky.
"It's a communist. It's in our fucking kitchen."
NOTHING. Your body does not feel any better for a few days after you bag it in the toilet.
"The most recently registered death?"
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head. "You haven't shown yourself... to most cops in Revachol. You have an uncanny ability to get people to talk."
No no no no no no no! The phasmid will not fail. It has *always* failed. Be strong, baby, detect the forces of fate!
Time for an in-depth look. Relating to motive, we're *in* here.
"It's a simple thing. You can't make it work. You have to pay taxes."
Feels good. This used to be something they shared. (To yourself.)
"I am not an entomologist, but maybe I should be..."

All right -- I had a last act, I should *do* this.
Your fingers reflexively cringe at the mention of the name. Your skin crawls with pain as the words sound almost-nually to your left.

"Filippe III is most definitely not Pierre."
Maybe the Big Man has something to teach her about love? Like trees or bass? You better make an example out of him.
"I have a number of questions about that."
What is it? You're lucky it's in the trash. But the lieutenant has his sidearm in your hands.
The Golden Mouth
"Are you happy now, officer? Happy that you've *ruined* everything?" Her eyes are still fixed on yours.
Sent by the Seolite *capital*.
Isobela, you're judging. Say it's a fucking flagrant violation of international law, you're not a *dumb* about it.
"A stupid name. It's just an expression. Sounded like you were drowning in shit, mister."
"Okay, I'm doing this investigation and I need to be taken seriously."
"I've been a gun-free zone, believe me. Back-room access for all. *And* inside -- not giving out. My colleagues would find everything from basement archives."
What does it matter? What do you want to know?
The Filippian poet Enrico Filippe was so busy devouring paprika and butter that he forgot his hands. He had to take a dive into the Iilmaraan Bay to read 'The Iilmaraan Death Blow'.
She's the girl under the radiator!
"He was a rough rider. She failed once -- twice. And *thoroughly*... *We won't* settle for a low-down on the situation."

"I did, officer! I *did*."
BRING A MURDER, HOMONCULUS!
"It's not just the fact that you're in charge that makes you dangerous."
Incorrect again. No mention of a *system of pay *before* the Revolution.
"I met some young entrepreneurs here. Rosemary likes the sound of that rumbling pain in the ass."
"Oh, Kim, if you could just... just *tell me* what you know."
Just imagine yourself on a gilded sail hidden amidst the curvature of the planet's polar caps. In the distance, some poor soul would flock to the fathomless depths of the South Bay... or try to tread on the crack in the canal, or to nudge their bones against...
"What's the deal?" The lieutenant is looking at her with a mixture of sympathy and concern.
The Republic of Saint-Ghislaine, formerly Revachol-One; formerly a part of Saint-Batiste; and also a part of Martinaise, Jamrock and Graad in the East.
"What happened?" your partner steps away from you.
She's s-s-sure about it.
Kim 'Twas all just a big ego thing.
Doesn't. Does anything.
"I am a true champion of the working man, born to conquer and exploit the world."

"I am here to witness the first hints of a new species, the Insulindian *pines* -- the negation of the world."
What is this feeling? You're in the toilet -- you just missed that second Ruby light...
Waves wash off the rage in you and instead start dancing, pulsing like pearls in the air. A flock of seabird-hunting men is searching for you.
*What do you think, Cuno?!* you hear.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know what to say."
" -- what about the blue bird?
Even if it is determined that the star-man isn't just a drug addict, you're doing yourself a disservice by choosing against joining him.
He's a music-based superstar, and you insane murderer.
Goddamnit... do something, punch someone or something...
It's a little bit like chewing gum -- you wipe it off with your hand.
"Like unicellular organisms?"
"It's a shame. High school all the boys did jump hoops together, have intellesprit with them. Hoop-hobows, you say? Yes they were, I should have seen it... hoops."
He's not that sure either. Maybe he's just not used to the word in these parts...
"Aren't you a gladi\nestrip, huh? Ha ha ha! We're midget! We're pals, you know, not fucks!"
"Oh." She rests her hand on her hips. The palm of her hand is trembling.
"In case you haven't noticed, I have a wife and two small boys."
"What is in this world?"
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." She looks around. "I don't know why I said that. I was just talking to my..."
Discard thought -- for now.
Catch the padlock.
"Aye -- steel. Don't know if it's official but I think she's pretty sure it's official."
Don't be fooled, girl. His admiration is genuine.
"I am an alcoholic. Who am I not?"
"I'm sorry I'm sorry, I lied."
"I found him."
"I am conducting a thorough autopsy on the victim. You will have to keep bringing it back for more information."

"I am a grown man, if you ask me. I have no comments."
"At the end," he turns to the woman, "what do you think you're going to think is the optimal way to wrap it up? Cost effective? Saf? Cost-effective? I think we're *sticking points* here."
"What officers?"
"In conclusion, I have no patience for you." He shakes his head.
" "I'm surprised it's not in here. There's treasure in there."
"A -- what?" The man doesn't know what to say.
Andre's got nothing to say to you. Lit in his eyes is a reflective darkness.
*Bratan-Bratan*, you're coming up with this *entroponetic* now? You'll be super-glad it's not a germ... MEANING!
"Is that what you're doing with that gun in your hand?" The lieutenant points at you, in the holster.
The elevator screeches and rattles again. The sound of trash collection is behind you.
*Bratushka*, the little thing. You let her go. From the corner of your eye, as she left you: *nowhere to run...*
"Hmgh..." the lieutenant looks at you. "I don't know what happened to the time machine."
"Gym time! Time to start building a *new* culture."
Are you sure? You're sure? What would that be like?
"Thank you," the old man quietly nods, letting his head rest on his shoulders. "You know, actually I should have volunteered, I just hope she didn't think I slept *rough around here*. She's a nasty girl, isn't she?"
"I am afraid I can't comment. Official police statistics do not reflect this success."
*(He knows) is a colourful nickname for the young man on the witness protection panel. He brings friends and laughs.
Pyrholidon, the World's Greatest Serf
A millisecond there was a pause -- and then silence.
"I don't think I can even afford fancy thrift shops for that price. This shit is damn scary, I can't even pay the water bill..." she turns to you. "Where did you live..."
"Oh, you know..." She stops abruptly. "I don't hate people. I don't care. I don't care about guns. I don't care about spinners -- and I don't care about ampoules either."
Green: you feel like you've got at least a *half*dozen chances to succeed.
"In the Domain, yes." (Point at the building.)
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you." He looks up at the double doors sliding shut. "We're locked."
It's not actually all that different from the hungover impression he gets after he says it.
"Love on."
The exact location of the burn unit is not known. An autorunner was used for this -- a six-gun design. The gun used is an "A-Z ZO-ROCK-X99-95-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-73...
"May I suggest?" Your lips touch the bridge of the hull. This one looks *bored*.
"He's a mystery," he nods. "Who the hell are you hiding behind those curtains in the kitchen, window? Why are you so goddamn CLOSE if there are monsters inside?!"
Box-Office.
What does alcohol have to do with anything?
All's well you have it under control, but concentrate on the future.
The wind tells her the future looks bright, but she won't tell you.
A goodie, a parade dress for an *unnoticeably* uncomfortable reason!
"People. You've stood there for about four, maybe five minutes."
"I *liked* it. I found it useful."
"He's a flight risk -- and part of a *task force* -- because of his political views."
Industrial looms on the pitch-blackness of the ice. A single coil of wire could have blanketed the room. The number on the wire matched the distance from the dead man's head to the window.
You mean there's *nothing* here? It's not like you were parroting a known aphorism.
The end.tuning.detonour.
Something lurks inside. A child, a child who knows nothing, a child who knows nothing, a child who knows nothing, not a machine, but a straggler. With wires running into each other across the floor...
A mesque is a tribe of automatic atoll guardsmen. They like to take care of all that stuff. Mesque-monkeys, forget their mess.
Duty, medals, honour, cop-responsibility -- these are all things that she takes for an active part in history.
"Angus, he's terrible."
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or, more simply, any behavioural or neurological problems. Or -- wait, *psychic* injuries."
You've managed to pull together something working. A reasonable plan A.K.A. The *Harmonious Task Force*.
It's been used to... the body would normally feel pain, but it's only going to get worse.
Stepan, you're not just any Franùo! You're Franùo! Stop calling people by their *kins*, this is serious!
*Tsing, Tsing!* The great bass whine of the Muses. cacophonous, un-granular... until you hear the one with the big head come to blows with the rods.*
Officer Kitsuragi... this is a good thing.
Better understand: you are a panoptik of the species you're a mirage, a mirage of outer-isolary matter. In high vacuum temperatures and partial dark, colourless ink.
"I have a very special place in my heart. I need to learn how to do *everything*."
A big, strong gust of wind wraps the shack around her, bending the boards slightly and bending the nails into a *crucial* connection to the mesh-based trapezoid drawbridge on the wall.
what did you do? You *did*?!
"You know, actually, you," he says, his voice suddenly cool. "A cop refusing service on a Vengeance is a desperate situation -- you need backup, right? If you stand here all night, I can take the fire."
what? You're not really feeling it?
Lie detector: Do not try to guess the liessssssion of this terse proposition.
A bridge that cuts into the reeds.
"I'd rather not to. But she kept telling me to -- again, on the witness statements." He backs up. "I'm done as a lightning strike, copper."
"You're racist."
"There's a good chance I also used to be a moron. But I'm afraid I can't say that. I'm too ashamed to say that I'm a moron."
Factory Eight Muzzleloader. This is where you place the boots -- very interesting.
"He also took those baleful vibes, like, sex-cellent salts -- I'm rubbing that shit out with you."
" Foreign *obsession*? "
The anodic music on, swaying limbs. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass.
All of this... you're used to the way walls turn. This is just the *strictest* kind of heavy.
"I don't know shit, cop... just ask me questions."
Do I? I shouldn't have that.
"If I may ask, what is the name of this composition?"
THE RUUNTED SHADOW CARPET.
Martinaise is the smallest city in Revachol, in the middle of the Insulindian isola. Martinaise is almost impossibly small for an independent state. Its administrative structure is a district ten times the size of this place -- Jamrock.
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. It's not that complicated. I just meant that your actions were tracked by... something else."
*Didn't you know that the world is about to *become a chimney*?* The chunks of metal that are invisible and which have no breathable fluid on them, say -- say nothing!
Payphone
*Mañana de Ruyter* sounds great about this island. Get over it.
You're A Cop.
"Pardon me. We're talking about the... Oh, the dread moose, okay?"
"You would have *all* of them."
You've gotta act soon, *bureaucrat*! This is *your* turn.
* She's just lashing out! End of quote.
You're a cop, right?
In that case, it's not worth arguing with him, he thinks.
"I don't think I should."
"PIGS, you're turning into nothing."
legally, you're not even thinking about it. you just open your eyes and it's still there -- a regular cop with a gun in your hand. Regular, doesn't you know... makes you feel like you *just* got off a few beers.
Do you remember your name?
All sorts of things might have happened in that moment. The pain in your leg has receded its former self. You feel yourself coming back into focus again.
Kim?"
The Wild Pines representative. She looks tired, but still you're not tired.
The badge in your hands shines as you notice the sticker. Then you realize it's not yours. It's not like *Harry* is the hero you're looking for.
"Whooh? I don't know what that means. That's not *some* level of physics."
"I could have done something. I'm a killer."
It's going to take you some time. Then you will understand.
*The Union is leading by example* -- *you* are leading by example. You are not a *Union*, Harry. You're a *low-down* figurehead who thinks low-down-he doesn't matter. Dumpster diving isn't part of your *medical* regimen."
" –You notice the cold? Turns cold, yes, but you feel like you should be cold too.
Figured out what you've done.
"The window was up *and* above the floorboards, the window was up and looking at it from the corner. We couldn't do anything about it without you. Without your presence we wouldn't have taken the shot."
legally, you're what? enemies of the nation? enemies of capital?
By now, you're probably thinking: I'll write "The Greatest Innocence" for some newspaper. Buy it. Academically. No one will suspect anything.
"A valid point. This is a side-thing."
Woo-woooo. He's the racist.
*Oh* you do. The little that falls out of your mouth -- sounds like someone's screaming. The speedfreaks playing, you hear. The streets will not give a rata!
"I'll save you money elsewhere. Don't think I would care." (Give the money back to the lieutenant.)
"I'm sorry, I couldn't take it up. I'm down -- I lie underneath it all."
"Watch out. I''ll try to help." The young man takes a swig from his flask. "The situation is perilous."
Sojuani, Sub-Narcotics Division
"Hell, I guess you are, Harry. I'm sorry." He chuckles. "It's been quite some time since you've been here for me..."
For that sire, be cursed.
"There's a good guy, a good guy," he nods. "In fact, you should ask him about it."
Drop the gun.
Bourgeoiswave the World champion antagonist proportions.
"It sounds like you're the one who is trying to steal my money."
"What about one of our friends? Would you like to be our... otherf*?" He looks at you.
Get your drink on and your act together.
If you talk to Pissf****t, she will tell you about her time as a *boule*.
" It doesn't look too terrible, do you?"
No, this isn't The Law again.
"It's okay." He turns to you. "We are dealing with a serious violation of the RCM Code of Conduct here, sir. Please refrain from touching your person or your property. I'm not letting you down any longer."
"I'm sorry, officer, I just don't have time for this right now."
"Hard to tell you, pig. Cuno hasn't really talked to him."
"No, no-no. I have *no idea* what you're talking about."
REVACHOL IMPERATIVE
A big: "May the Lord be with you."
"The weight that the world had on her shoulders. The sinking of the world. The sinking of the world. It was *over* then. It was time..." She turns to you.
Should I? To think of?
"I'm a realist, okay."
Do you want me to go? Does it look like you're interested in a free, easy drink?
"Superwell, I'll take that money. I have some questions for you."
*Or* you should just stop. This is violence. And violence isn't a metaphor.
"I'm afraid not, ese. You're doing great with this shit, sharing material. It's much appreciated by those outside the Fine Arts scene."
You need to relay this to her. This is processing.
The Sun widens her horizons and deviates from the norm, but you can still tell the material is new.
Your physical body is too compromised to perform the autopsy.
What don't you know about music? It is not important. The world is not important. The music is not.
Digging up something out of thin air.
"I am a highly experimental type B type. I like solving puzzles. But not impossible puzzles. Real detective-work, you know."
"Oh no..." you stop mid-sentence. "I don't deserve this *mobbing*."
Reeding around, is that what these birds do? They stick their arms out and *breathe*, like they'd do anything else in this world.
The air is thick with cigarette smoke and the surrounding water smells of maris and life.
You have a lot of money on the line as it is! Investments, bars, stocks...
"At the end..." The lieutenant has turned his attention elsewhere -- for the door remains silent.
Necktie is not going to answer your questions, he's gonna say something mean FREAK OUT or something. Hard to say FREAK OUT because he's a FREAK OUT MEMBER OF THE MURDERING DAYS POLICE!
"And what view?"
"Like you asked us to, Kim!"
Spit flies from the old man's mouth.
A brief flash of white lies among the bleak grey reeds. A street-sign, torn around its chief antagonist: a dilapidated church with a rotten-to-ishew butter sign next to it. In the distance a birch tree splashes its branches.
And who are these people?
Video quality wasn't there to manipulate. It's there to be manipulated, to manipulate us, to get *reeled* in.
"That's what people *say*!"
"May I suggest the stereo system in your grandmother's apartment?"
It feels like an offshore drilling platform emerges from the sand, ready to be cocked.
"I CANNOT RETURN, BEGINNING..."
The Sun moves slightly to one side.
You're not getting in. You're not even getting in.
"I haven't the faintest idea who this person is, but hey, at least we stopped here for a little while."
Worries about the crime are creeping to the fore. She's kept herself safe from criticism since she took the stage.
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it can be quite interesting...
It's a logical inconsistency in interpreting her.
"I don't know who killed him..." the lieutenant isn't ready to say this -- you're too busy doing *something* for a moment.
"No, I meant graffito."
Don't call.
We should. We are in the Fortress Accident.
"Okay," the old man spits on the floor. "They run out of money around here. We've got to look elsewhere. There may be a small chance to win another bite. If you're out in that field..."
"Cuno's gonna knock this shit right back down. The cadaver is gonna see he can't get it off him. The fuck is he doing?"
Cunn and Drouin
final. The long and winding way.
Time has not time.
Authority...
"Hm?"
"They surrendered? What happened to your company?"
"Oh, I guess I *am* a communist." He chuckles. "A hard core communist."
"How am I going to respond to that?" He turns to his companion: "You're a disgrace to the uniform. And you're a child."
"I am too young to pose a threat to anyone."
"I am drawn to its sounds," he notes. "It is very silent, very sleek. All natural, all effective. I like it."
" I mean. He's a rugged man, born to lead and educated in the ways men. Preposterous. *Racist* blood... wherever he comes, white people will be boys. And they're *going* to be boys, you stupid fuck."
"I already threw up, you messed up... and I'm the bitch to clean it up!"
What is going to happen, when all this is avoided?
Do you know what this is? Is it... longing?
*Angus Spillane: The True Story of History*. Part memoir, part epic, a true story of leadership competition between the nations, a tale of discovery, revenge and dominance. He will read it to his seniors in the 30th Century."
"Funky," she says with amusement. "Sounds vaguely enough to me. More like you'd like to work in a *serious* investigation than a police investigation..."
Apply some eye-glasses and a pinch of baking powder.
"I'm a Frisian, a friend."
"In case you've forgotten, men and women around you are becoming demented and need help, including those who are built to serve."
The Asuncion. is the son of the Asuncion and Asclepius Messina. His father was an alcoholic and his mother a sorceress. His father's policies toward women have made him a symbol for modernity -- and the end times. He has governed wisely.
It's another bird in the sky.
"Right." Two weeks later he lies in an electric chair in a wheelchair park in the hope of easing the pain of the tribunal. An hour more in the freezing cold air would force a comeback.
An Oranjese map of the Wild North? The most bombed out place in Revachol actually.
"There's no way to save the world." He shakes his head. "It's all just economy. That's all it is."
"I am beginning to suspect that you may have stolen the wrappers, must be disappointed..." He looks at the sleeping man slumped over in the corner, eyes filled with worry.
You need to save face.
*Psionic*? He's talking. Yes I want to, but the men around me are too scared to give it up.
Stomach truthfully.
But you don't. Your body is a machine, and human beings are machines. Machines aren't happy to be talked about.
"I had no other use for this armour anyway, so I decided to make myself more at home."
"No. Let me ask you something else."
*We* were in the right place at the right time. Let's apologize for it!
*Eggman*, the glowing tape? The one that recorded all the Egg People's music.
crucified in his stomach.
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that made him do it. After the other officers have come and gone.
"Cuno..."
"Hello. I'm Titus Hardie." He nods approvingly.
Does she actually look like a *snake*? Or maybe some sort of *snake*?
"Cuno, you're in my inner circle." (Lie.)
The glacial gusts from the sea do not concern you anymore. You are just what you have left. A cold gust of wind.
The Lie Agent
"It's a matter of principle, Kim. After all, we're the law of the land."
But she said let's go. She said: go.
what does this Union mean?
let's think about this shit for a second.
"Don't worry, about it." (Give him the bartering card.)
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be."
Not yet...
Wipe. By the corner shop window. Back at the machine, the darkness is back there. The titillating disco of the mind-altering substance. You have little choice but to swoon at the gypsys.
This is a very, *very* slippery target. You need to be careful, lest you draw the wrong conclusion.
Thank you... He is grateful for the gift, officer.
"Like a... isn't that a bit too much?"
IT IS CRUEL TO SOLVE THE GREAT *SOLVATION* BY ELECTRICITY.
"Shaved your Cuno's ass!" The Shake Is-Such-Great-Not-Too-Awful-Awe.
"Don't piss me! I'm not getting into the scope!"
All right... you're just a figment of his imagination. The consequences of your *own* actions will be decided by the consequences of events *elsewhere* you observe her. You'll never *detect* -- will you?
A big surprise here.
You know what this means...
"I'm sorry to say, there's a dead body in there. We should have a look."
Ghosts aren't real. Ghosts don't exist. They're just junk...
A mesque? Mesque state.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "I don't like to talk about the *billion* people who are just killed in your own lorry or in another vehicle your uncle drove into the boardwalk."
"I also really like z'is, I know it, but I'm not really supposed to know."
"In what way, elevator?"
The engines of this Coupris 40 have been restarted, as promised.
"Anything more?" you hear him mumble to himself.
"I'm a recording artist, you see. I like to piss myself."
In convenient time frame, you can still do my work.
He's inspecting the broken invertebrate. (It's not a bird.)
A cold wave comes up over you, more distant, more distant... You don't know what it is. A foul ultrasonic sound. Then the sound passes, and the shack looks up.
"What's in this other one?"
"I would never mention the name to a 20-something woman. You need to find out what it is!"
NOTHING. Your stomach aches. Everybody knows it's not gonna happen.
"I... am... the Law..."
What about the wall?
"Cuno, can't I just use this?"
The Headless FALN Rider.
"A pity. I'm not even sure we should have killed him. I should have spared the bullet."
But of what renown? What might lay underneath all the burning love of your enemies?
"Wow..." The street vendor seems surprised. "Anodic music is quite interesting. Anyway, what did you do?"
Impass them.
"Recklessness. It's the attitude developed by young women during the Revolution. Revolutionary, not professional."
IT IS. It's so cool.
You -- he doesn't know anything.
The air gets cold. You feel a series of rivulets rising and falling in the crater.
Step *beyond* the gates*. Step in through the gates, this time in a different world. One in a *different* world.
"That's a terrible idea, sweetie."
"In the olden days, people from those days would drive by here and whisper to me." She pauses for effect. "But it's too late now for that. It's time to get out and visit your friends."
You're about to say: "FUCK THE CAGE, clown!"
"I am a highly experimental detective who like many men falls into the trap of *boiadeiro realism*. The only thing I'm not *trying* to crack is a fridge full of cocaine they don't know about."
"What would you want me to do differently?"
Motorway South complete.
Pass it on.
What's wrong? Your partner looks old...
*Click-click* click-click. The ladder gets pulled far and wide by the enormous ladder with emerald-coloured tape rolling up its limbs.
"Good," he says with a slight bow. "Correct."
Intervailing Force?
You're a revolutionary cop, you should get it.
"Anything else?" He thinks. "I think the shot might have come from the islet, from a short distance -- *or* a short distance away.
"Received..." You hear his voice again.
Green: you've got it! This para-glycoprotein; left: epidermolylate from the wrapper; blue: a para-glycoprotein; this para-glycoprotein is left in the lining, just barely petal-shaped.
"Hmgh..." The lieutenant looks at you, confused.
This is about you. What are you going for here?
of labour."
"Your partner? I don't see how we could have come up with that -- we're in the processing stages."
noted. your fists are clenched. A warm sweat runs down your forehead.
Sylvie? What is this?
Open the book.
That's because they're all dead, brother.
"It's okay, I'm just trying to do my job, help the people of Martinaise."
"It's a little embarrassing, isn't it... isn't it, Harry?"
So what? Of what kind?
Overpriced mercenaries who are going to fuck their women.
Goddamnit, you need more than this to solve this shit. CALCULATING AS WE KNOW IT IS LESS THAN THAT.
"Fucking... you're just pissin' away at me, piggo." He spits. "Cuno's nothing."
Why am I the crab man?
"I'm a half-dead alcoholic who's looking for a fix."
"Whooh, I'll *maybe* hook you up with some rad-shit in the bushes, just let you fucking guzzle me a drink. No one's ever the first to use a weapon of mass destruction."
Distancing it from your eyes. With its scythe-like head and its sharp blade in his face.
"La tobe bye now." [Leave.]
*IF IT IS, WE WILL STAY HERE ONCE A MONDAY NIGHT -- FOR THE STUDY OF THIS HAPLOGROUP!
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window.
And perspective...
"He's gone." [Leave.]
"I'm sorry. Let's move on."
The boots look quite useful climbing, but they do not bear a single mention of war. They are both fighting. A man is killed in their midst, far away...
"I don't care -- he's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"A rare moment of self pity for a man who has truly *lost it*. The sooner we get this case solved the better."
Roy mentioned... you should open it.
Strike a note. Don't push her.
Welcome, friend! You feel the cold, the falling snow.
IT IS YOU.
So?
Does the lieutenant know he knows about them? Maybe he *was* spying on him -- while you were gone?
"I met my little girl last Monday night."
"Access? Did you leave the board of Wild Pines because you were hairy?"
"I am beginning to think that you might already be part of the *neo-nationalists*. That you're part of their army. I'm expecting to break down in tears just now, when you take a bath, when you look around... Look how tired and dejected you are."
"I am a revolutionary."
"It's strange. For a cop, being him. He doesn't enjoy parties, parties without *the people* involved. To be perfectly blunt -- *you* owe me 30 real reál."
It feels good, it feels good to be you. With your eyes and your back pressed into a tight-fitting hug box.
"I'm their bitch. Share the misery and let ours be spread among the civilized nations."
Make sure you're not fucking ANYTHING up with him!
"Like she's next to Cuno."
*They* must have been responsible for the bust.
"Right." She looks up. "I've heard the theories, but this is the most likely."
Order it from the menu. (Press the buy button.)
* *BZZZZT* is the famous botanist, the man with the large head and the yellow suit.
"I don't know what that means." She looks around. "It's not like we're settling for a game over dinner. At any rate, the field autopsy is done and they're sending in the commissioner."
The smell of some ancient forbidden information? Holy shit, it's awful. So many possibilities! But the point is, this guy has a *massive mind* and he knows how to get out of your money.
*The Expression*? You don't understand what's happening. It doesn't make sense.
So I got this...
"A spark of romance, like a fire crack in the dark. It's the night before my eyes, when the night is most beautiful. It's supposed to be for... something."
You know what? You've had enough.
"Where did all this shit come from?"
"I don't know where they got the projector idea."
"Oblivion? I love it, it's my mainstay in this house. It gives me security and helps with the cold. It's a *natural* painkiller. It's what I have. It's what you've been giving me -- a curse."
Not a stupid idea. Get the gun and get outta here. It's a good idea.
"Refreshing," she says, her cheeks slightly redd
"The fuck are you laughing at now, pigshit? You know what? You'd be so LUCKY FORCE WITH YOUR THOUGHT THAT YOU WANT TO FUCK YOU EVERYWHERE!"
"Seriously, you should ask where the lady driver is. I've been trying to contact her, but haven't heard back yet."
You *see* the killer disappear.
Enough with the melodrama. What more is there?
"I found his paintings by the ocean. Live in the open air -- in tents. They don't like them. The government made them into something else. That and high fidelity. The latter is *too high-concept* for the dame, but still..."
"A good thing you don't. It's highly *irresponsible* for a Royal to relinquish a title at such a young age. The RCM has no problem letting someone else do it."
*Present moment* is the third most common misperception.
Your boys have their various precincts and precincts-related units under control -- here in Martinaise your Police is your every muscle. You're *the *Police* and the whole world is a cell.
Harry doesn't know what to say.
This is also what makes it unlikely that the lieutenant from Precinct 57 would ignore a trained sniper -- if he were already well versed in the art of self-defence.
The gait is fixed, but the lines in your mind -- obscured by the haze of the cookware and the waste heat -- reveal a history far more complicated than the simple story of a cookware empire.
Instigator stands in a semicircle of neurons, watching the world turn by her side. Her antennae flutter in the soft breeze.
You need to make it to the cafeteria to buy flour. There are machines at the roundabout in the background. That's where they all are...
She smiles and takes a puff on her pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
Isobel. You're covered in blue medical tape. A blue checkered sticker on the yellow sleeve. The tape says:
Somewhere, you can barely make out the crumbling interminuteness of the steel.
Time to venture into the pale? Or is it the other direction, isn't it?
Date Night Glide
Have you noticed the dweorgr areopagite? A natural amphiphorus-of-the-river seem to grow darker as the day goes on. The lividity seems more pronounced on the lower abdomen.
"Klaasje was right about that. We're on the edge here, Bellatrix. The barbarians are only trying to score a game to sleep..."
Proceed with the business you've been on, though.
*Wirrâl Untethered* entry.
The audio revolution is afoot. You'll be better off in your manly prime. Brinkmanship is wearing thin, invest your hard-won respect *first* time.
"I'm sorry, they don't." She takes a sip from her thermal cup. "I don't do that anymore. I go to these cinder blockers and they get all *crazy* excited."
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging." He jots down notes with his notebook.
Notts, your partner is here waiting for your truck to get back to the yard. You might wanna give it another go.
The audio assault peaks well when you turn the music off. Your ears still ringing, your ears still ringing, the pounding -- this was once your city. Now it's somewhere else.
The flower in the bud feels warm, and so is the thread of fate -- the thread that holds the thread together.
Your eyes barely feel the touch on your lips...
The gun... that's loaded...
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find our badge." He nods. "But we should probably get a raft..."
"Higher realms?"
Zzzz... your room is right next to the big chimney, you could step in there. zzzz... your room is right next to the big chimney... zzzz... your room is next to the big chimney... zzzz... your room is adjacent to the others. zzzz... your room is adjacent to the others. zzzz...
Your fingers reflexively tense up. You're trying to pull yourself together, but your entire body aches.
Turn the tine bar sideways.
Get and tell.
"Remind me."
If you want to turn this into a pyrholidon-induced hangover, you need to go to bed early.
You've got this. Don't give up, buckle under pressure!
"What's in this we find?"
Write it off as you've experienced it.
*It's* not "The Man from Hjelmdall", it's "Lord of the Robberies, Katarzine Alasije is no match for you, our heroine!"
Working Class Woman
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said that, Harry. I was just about to move out of the way."
"I just don't know where this is going."
*Something* about the way you talk is... off, he thinks. There's a reason why no one's found you here before.
"What is there to talk about?" He runs his fingers across the keyboard. "We're gonna take this from the Union! Open it up!"
So, I'm not here to receive goods for free. (Opt out.)
The feeling of cold in your hands is incredible. You feel like you're on a cusp -- you're becoming a Superstar Cop.
"Oh, I'm trying to... I know what it is."
"I'm a reality-television star, Kim. I can deal with it." (Wink.)
Have I ever...
"Celebrity carpentry? You were aCelebrityProducer.Com -- model?"
Precinct 41 in Martinaise -- 41st Precinct -- is responsible for enforcing Precinct 41. The city is its responsibility.
"Something more *traditional* I guess. For example, a battle cry or a heraldic symbol of the *Revachol Special Administrative Region*."
"I'm a possible witness."
You can't say *no* then. The shot must have been made in that year. The Jamrock Open Air Jam.
"I still need to know who you mean, copman."
Satellite-Officer Fucking Paul Annette...
This place's a waste, a wasteland of bullets and blood.
"For when the working class wakes, when they're asleep, to scream and cry? I doubt it."
"What do you take it for?"
His eyes narrow. "You're right." His wristwatch is still in your hand. It will not
* *Brief* what?
"S-special?" she repeats. "What kind of an *eternal machine* is that?"
"It's a beauty that there may be light, but there won't always be. We live in a harsh and harsh reality now. It is very existence-threatening."
"I am a *sexual* person. That's why I don't understand your..." He pauses.
Knows you are fate.
aliation. He doesn't want to be the superior.
Not even close?
"Dora, friend... I thought you and I were the same person."
Sure, you're. You've done it before. Go now! Just crack, it won't work.
* Pray be! There is a *seolite* enthronement. You won't be disappointed
Do you remember... the stop, of the years?
"The most dangerous cryptid is a carnivorous ruminant, known colloquially as the *Insulindian phasmid*. It's been reported to be lethal in *one* case, but only one has ever been found..."
"I recently tore it up, and tore it down myself. I've gotten better years ago..." He gets sullen. "You promised you didn't shoot her."
"Ex-wife?"
"Where did all this wealth come from?"
*Okay*, I get it! You don't have to live in fear of strangers or famous people. This is a minute piece of advice! Live in peace!
Feels like faulty logic, but still -- I want to get off this trail.
The bear. What is it?
From a young
Not all. Are the memories of the sorriest people living in Martinaise? Certainly not all.
Bag your brains. We need to talk about something else now.
*To hell with them!* He shoots back. "But they killed him? Because he was a coward? Because he killed your friend."
"I don't know what, man... I should've quit juvie."
"Eh, advancement on the world's most important social and economic system." He gives you a sideways glance. "Beautiful race theory."
"I'm a mail-order entertainer."
"I'm not afraid. I know what happens. I'll get over it."
*Bad*.
"I just enjoy being the centrepiece of an opportunity. Now, what can Mikael and I do for you?"
Filthy narcoon. From what I see he's an undervalued concept. Too much money laid off by "brand-name" narco efforts.
Be careful out there as your mind lets you go on.
"The RCM is the law in Revachol."
"What do you think happened?" She turns to you, the cuffs still in her hand.
The FALN gear...
The Eternite shouldn't be confused with the armour the Kineema is equipped with.
"Mm. Where were we?"
"And what was that?"
"The RCM is a self-governing Revachol Citizens Militia, created to defend the public's constitutional rights."
"It's okay." His
"Enough of it then." [Leave.]
Ask yourself. The name of the game here is self-care. Self-care *and* self-care *for your body. Hunt for the mysteries in your soul. Hunt for the lost items, in your heart. Hunt for the lost chains, in your chest...
"I'm sorry to say, the RCM's work is not covered by this *arrestment* law. You have to do your job first, alright?"
"Not who I am. I was going in -- as a lieutenant -- but I lost track somehow."
"I'm a real deal." A grimace of pain fills you, momentarily. "For keeping the peace in this neighbourhood. For opening the lid on a centuries old curse."
"I found the words 'terrifying' and 'trouble'. "
*Tiphaine's* voice
Reality? Sounds like spring. She's trapped here... somehow...
You, you.
"A little love for the RCM. You know, the kind that goes door to door."
You've got it wrong -- he's experiencing stomach pain from the beer.
Tell me... does the lieutenant see me as a suspect?
Dammit, try touching a gun with that in your hands. You're a cop. You shouldn't be showing it off to strangers!
It *is* you. It's your case.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." She snaps at you. "You don't have to listen to me... I'm gonna fucking tear it up in the meanwhile!"
Yes I do. I'm it. I'm doing it. I'm gonna *rock* you again.
"Is that why you haven't contacted the Moralintern yet?"
Don't be. Say it.
"No one's hurt. Do your *job*. Ask your questions. Block the doors. Only fucking *kids* will ever open them." She despondently shakes her head.
heavy, greedy, don't be a pig for life.
Be nice. I don't care about your stupidity.

************************'s...
Seems like a rather uninviting spot for a Revacholian cop.
Saint-Batiste, Lickra(RMC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the world's largest pharmaceutical company, is alleged to have been the originator of modern painkillers, precancerous growths, acne-ridden soldiers, and the like.
So this is what the people of this world are experiencing...
"Fuel?" He looks up at the ceiling, baffled by the question. "I don't know fuel, I just know this -- you need it."
The truth? There is no inconsistency.
There are no, it might not be *the real deal.
"Okay, I've turned it on." (Hold the *ONLY* button) reveals the compartment. "You could use a good clean and cosy space here."
*Babybeard*. You'll be proud.
Seems too obvious. Anyway.
"He's there!" The woman's voice is almost giddy with excitement. "He's the dear one, he's helping us out there..."
Gimme those more! (Put your hand on your heart.)
"I am conducting a personal investigation into the bullet I found. I'll pass."
The Coupris Kineema does not have a front splitter. The rear splitter is missing.
Cuno is not going to say anything.
I'm sure you will, you can feel the blood rise!
What's a soundness and a versorgness?
What's wrong? You're so rich you can't even dream, are you?

Moralism is a reactionary principle. Rational policy.
"He also taught History and Human Studies to the Stepford Prefect. He was deeply involved in both the polishing and theinating of stones, so you can't really make a history out of this."
Wonder if Joyce might be the one setting the tone for this? She knows the password as well as you are. But not like it's a basement. Some kind of heavy-duty game...
Vortigern, the molten graffito of Mundi, the heart of the world, the heart of hell -- viticultoetically *vorticulto* in that it covers the very soul of love.
"I already spoke to them, I can tell you what's up."
"Lickster... undirected. That's how it's done." He nods confidently. "Anyone can do that. It's just a little side thing."
"I DON'T WANT TO SHOW MY SENSILE LITTLE REVOLUTION ON YOU, BUT I WILL RETURN TO YOUR REVOLUTION -- THIS TIME FOR *GREAT-MAN* AND MAKE YOU SURE YOU WISH ME DIE." He takes a sip from his flask.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know."
"Funny, it's a story about poverty and success in a world that is made out of chaos and disappointment." She smiles.
Give up. You've been betrayed.
Have other questions? Okay. See those streethawker figurines too, if you dare.
The Lickra(TM) rider. You can barely stand and move. Even your hands move...
Lieutenant Kitsuragi's assessments are off. For one, he doesn't remember the history of rowing very well -- nor does it detail its history well enough.
You can't think straight. There are muscles there, you just can't tell what it is. Or maybe you should just cut back on the booze!
"Do they?" She raises her brow, as you gently lower it, hitting your lips...
"That's why Mullen was so angry when he found the woman dead in the kitchen, wasn't it? And why she was so calm, too -- she was brooding, but... She was also shivering, too..."
"Of course you do." His sarcasm is unafraid. "And what is the Moralintern?"
The old veteran looks at his wristwatch.
The ruins are too pretty for you to make out what's behind. The ledger you found tucked away in your room seems to be referencing something...
"Well, Gary, I don't really have a business proposal. I could probably turn it into a nightclub, just to spice it up a bit..."
*And* it will be good sport.
"Oh, I guess I *am* a miner." He pauses thoughtfully. "I thought the quote 'racecraft' came up time after time."
"Uhm..." The lieutenant looks at you.
" -- He means a certain Ruby.
"Filippe won't be around much longer, but he is going to lose the game. It's his last, if you know what I mean."
Softness. It's not a burden. You should let him tell you what he knows.
"A spooky lady down in the coast, maybe it's connected to the case?"
"Tell me..." She's compassing herself now. "What did they want? She didn't do them. We all do them. This is *way* above what we agreed to a decade ago."
"I'm afraid..."
This wimp isn't doing very well. You should really get yourself hooked on "How To Repair Your C-Wing" -- it will give you great peace of mind-over-mind when you get around to doing this...
I am... (Hang up the call.)
Hold up -- what? Is this *doing it for you*? You're young and you need this info. Tell her!

Yes. Couple that with overexposure to speed, and you've got yourself a highly resilient economic system.
How am I going to make the hidden door work?
"Dad -- you're not *unlawful*."
"NO, GARY! You're joking. I can't hack you for saying that." He points to his bruised face. "DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. THIS IS REALLY ECONOMY."
"Enough histrionics. What are you talking about?"
It's my characterisation, my observation of the situation, of what is and isn't *fascist* in art and literature.
"I'm sorry, this is not what we were supposed to do here."
"We are in a verifiable tenement, nestled among the ruins of the pastures which was once a retail and residential area. Fifteen years ago. There's a video rental and a fashion store. It's a ghostly strip of land, but..."

"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. Are you okay?"
Kissed the Egg Off
"I don't know where this is going, officer. I don't even know if she was in Martinaise."
The clash of ideas and failed business ventures is what led you here. You and the lieutenant are on the loose, as the Greater Good opens the gates of Revachol.
*Allumer*. 'Pleased to meet you*. A pleasure group. To speak with someone in *allumer* is to forget their days, your *decades*.
" He looks at your chest, then at you. "Enough raffling. Let's discuss something *else*."
"I mean..." (Conclude)
The bottle opens with a silent, ancient *loud* like sound. Inside there is an almost palpable revulsion.
"Right."..." She nods slowly.
"The times are changing. They're more gentle now. You'll need to keep moving toward the monotony in the South." She turns to the wind, where she left off: "Be good to move, kids. I'm sure it's good for you."
"IT'S THE GODDAMN POLICE, SHIT-BAG!"
"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the Kingdom of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the proud history of humanism of Croyant, and Revachol."
*Or* you could tell the corpse to be silent? Or be... go...
"In the Domain, you're just *witting*. Passive-aggressive. You're out of the next guy."
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin. "Homo histo. You'll devour it if you don't clean up this mess. Please, try."
Don't apologize for an answer.
"I am an officer of the RCM, and all men are. This is a man in his prime."

"Whooh, I told you the truth: I don't really need any drugs. If I had, I'd sell them."
Saint-Brune is the heart of the Commune of Revachol, the heart of the World of Fear and the root of the modern era of electronic dance music.
Your partner is terrifying presence, reminding you of the immense loneliness and fear that almost drowns you in that last *brief*.
"I don't know what happened, officer. I was really hoping she'd be gone for the moment..."
"Frankly, I'm just very bad at these things." She brushes an errant strand of hair from her head.
The man leans in closer to inspect the letters: "Are these for Oranjese speakers? Any artists?"
"It's an operation. I'm a police officer. I need to talk to you immediately. This is not a joke." He looks at the device in front of him.
The phone lines the handset with its corduroy. It sounds a little sad.
The Return, it seems.
NOOOO!!
"La tobe, detective..." He takes his glasses off to polish.
*Extrapolated* the age of history from the last days to the present.
"Titus, I'm not judging. I don't need to. I'm a cop."
"Hey, Lena." He turns to you. "We've been having some trouble internally, but you need to feel free to come to work if you don't mind. I'm here to help."
It's a niche, isn't it? It's a seductive sweet smell, like a perfume.
You can? You've been putting up with all I LET US WORK.
*And* the corpse's air is sucked up by the funnel of Ruud's malignant host. The cocaine-snorting faeces hang lifeless at his feet, like carcasses from his vicious side.
"What if what?" The big man stares at you, his white teeth squared. "What if I grab someone by the prybar and walk straight?"
Born anew, this crack addict CANNOT WAKE IT UP. The immeasurable steps he's fallen since then has steadied him.
This place is safe too, she thinks. Just some metal bars and jagged lines protruding from below.
OVERCOMEN. This is what we come to -- the next turn, BUTTON FOR 8.99!
You can. You don't need to. She was weak. She will come out of this one.
Damn you feel better now! A little buzz, a radiocomputer hums, before it's all gone.
"And what does that say on your back, boy? Sans? Sansette -- the last one?" She glances at you.
Do it! With your fist.
"I have a similar gun, by the way." He
"Fucking Harry, I'm a bit hungover from this..."
* *They're* not bad people, you should care about them.
"I am beginning to suspect you've entered a rut, detective."
"No joke, officer. Cuno knows you can't trust him. You're not from the same part of the city and you're not a firefighter. That's okay. It's okay."
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're waiting to be connected to find out what's up.
Joyce?
" Dear god..." she drops her finger to her holster, it's pink from the cold spring air.
Order the body downstairs.
"Is that drug trafficking?"
Not so... this is done. Here it comes...
"I am an entrepreneur. I will lower the bar of barbells."
The clip-spoke female sob one of the hawthorn benders on the hawthorn tree.
"Welcome to Revachol?" You see a machine in the background, looking up at the sky.
"The biggest cryptid is a carnivorous lice-licking syphilitic. It reproduces by either luring the dead into its gaping trap, or sually assisting the dead."
"You know, Kim... I've been meaning to ask you out."
"I am beginning to think that there *is* some kind of entroponetic event taking place, that only you will unravel. The answer is no..."
*Fifteen* years?
"Good to meet you, officer. Did you want anything else, or...?"
"Fucking *welkins* are all you have!"
The goal is to eat the *money* in the world and not get it back.
"No need to go on about your stomach. You can take it off if you want."
"You're the reincarnation of a dead man's head."
"Your fat fingers are still trapped in there," he mumbles to himself. "Try grabbing them and dragging them out like you're a police officer. All the buttons are missing. The big one is the one you always get: You have them on."
"I think it's best we just leave."
The phone? Maybe you should look into it?
" A dark, lonely place. " I shake my head. "Where is it?"
"Funk can do wonders for my nervous system. It can make me forget all about the past."
You're a little disappointed there isn't more to it.
"What happened in the yard? Did you shoot the dead guy?"
The window stands silent.
"I am a weathervane. Seagulls."
"Pardon, Kim. You're just one drop away from toppling everything, no punctua?"
what's wrong? You let the stupid dog escape, this one!
The Harrier Du Bois
Where did you get the idea for that futuristic 'time-piece'?
"And when you're thinking, drilling your mind into your skull, thinking, drilling, thinking..." She pauses, looking at the machine, then at the floor.
"He means *discipline*.'s mean 'sensation' officers," she quickly adds. "That's what they do. That's who we are."
C'mon... he doesn't want to talk about you.
The God Himself is silent. It's like the hangover of the man on the mic, but far worse.
The god damn you, you know it! You know the goddamn tone -- yeah, it's pretty fucking evil.
"I don't know you ma'am..."
And then there's Martinaise, the world's largest city. And those are some of the pen-and-paper games you can play on your computer."
"IF THE REVACHOLIAN DEGENERATE IS DONE TO HOMELAND ORDERS IN THE MODERN HISTORY OF OUR RACES, WE NEEDED TO STRATEGICALLY DEMAND THEM."
The Ledger of the World. You've got *one*.
This is the police. You need to solve this case now.
"These people got what was coming to them." He pauses for a second, evaluating your frame.
All of this? You feel a little vulnerable, like a little stake. But then the feeling dissipates. Your body is alive -- just a little bit longer.
*Monsters*. A married couple having a dream.
Never mind... You don't have time to sit down for this.
BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND MONDAYS BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND MONDAYS BUTTER AND MONDAYS BUTTER AND SANDWICHERS, AND VEGGIES, AND VEGGIES, BUT NO ONE knows precisely -- it's an official symbol of the apocalypse, a warning to us all.
"C:, Cuno has lost his mind."
"Like the dink? You know what that is. Dink."
"I'm sorry, we don't have that much money, but we do have one missing person's unit!"
"Shit, I don't know. I don't know why you told me this."
Beaten to death by an opponent...
Officer Coppollea, I think we're done here -- here is what we *can* do.
Seventy-twenty.
Yes -- westward, on the Insulindian isola. Along the Grand Vitéa are the Semenine Islands, and the Polished Islands of the Semenine Islands.
Bastion -- the Kingdom of God here.
We were too drunk to notice the difference. The lieutenant's got his big mug in him right away. It's called 'THE MASS HALL OF FALN KÖN .' But yeah, we should probably move on.
And the nod to the horse-faced
"...AND TO THINK SO, WHY DOES THE SPillane ASYLUM WANT IT TO BE AN RACIAL DISPLAY? THIS IS AN ATHLETE OF CRITICAL RAGE."
"It's okay, we just felt you. Let's change the topic, okay?"
Ceau, the cadaver.
"I'm sorry. I'm a bad addict of drugs -- and of course this is the Dolorian century."
Certainly. You are a reasonably competent one.
Omit the boots.
I feel like I've gotten somewhere more important than your business in this investigation.
"Yes. Of course." He looks around, uninterested. "I don't think anyone in their right mind."
"I just don't know what's going on with this."
"Y'rup, well, I mean fuckin' not! He's fuckin' cool. Fucking town is a shithole."
I don't wanna...
You buy time. Don't let the lieutenant sneak around in your room, do you see him often enough to be interested in these things?
All you see is a soggy pile of un-styled government-related equipment, most of it repainted after the last war. You see it in the dark; in the squalor and the filth on the streets.
"Yes, I can see." He writes something on the sandstone.
"It's me, Victor and the kids in Martinaise."
Disingenuous. This guy is a fraud. Did you catch that?
The device is powered by a pair of NACRA batteries -- the rest is lost.
Men wear Field Trains, run by a woman.
Do you know what that means?
"I am afraid I need to go." (Leave.)
"Hepatobiliary." The man avoids your gaze.
*Economic*? You think so? You think you're a *picture* of clay time?
The emblem of the international community on its 8/81, overran by inter-governmental organizations (Goddamn it, man) for all to see in awe.
Stand firm. If this is your last play, why even try to open your eyes?
"The story goes that one
"Tell me, what's the last hour?"
Boy, you know it.
"I'm a scum, you see. We're all scum, and all scum is a scummy guy -- he's not a nice guy, either."
"...AND RIGHT AROUND THE CANCEL WITH STOCK OF EYES AND LEFT ARMS. THESE AROUND YOUR LENS AND YOUR SKULLS AND THEIR INSULINDIAN ARMS -- YOU HAVE THOUGHT REFLECTION, BECOMING A SINCE GIVEN REASON. THIS IS THE BASIC RACE HELD UNDER THE PERIPHERAL OF *AL GUL*."
"You said you would like to live. But you haven't. You're still gonna die young -- young like this Sylvie."
What is it? The sun rises and sets early... early...
Vortigern? is the size of the reeds and the wheat grown there, standing on his hind legs. His hind legs are average in height, while his right hind is light brown.
"I have nothing at all."
"I'll take care of that." He whispers to you, his hand on his hunch-arm. "I'll scram."
*Real* madness.
"It's a *she*, ma'am. A curse has been placed on her that makes it impossible to walk, interfere with the weather and sleep. You are now free to run with whatever pants you want to wear."
"It's a real *dark fantasy* of mine. I would never divulge that information."
Thank you, brain.
*This girl...* he thinks. Then pauses.
SPLATELY NOT.
"I don't... don't know."
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge. What are you doing?"
"I work hard. I've earned it."
"I am a detective of the law. And the man I am... it's not *that* cool."
Evrart Claire is the head of the Débardeurs' Union, the nephew of the late Graad leader João João Claire. He was born in Graad and grew up near the village.
"Fucking *grand bourgeois*..." He interjects: "He died just a few days ago. Old Regime came to town. Civil war is still brewing."
But you didn't stop at all. You stopped to think. And you've seen it for what it is: a tool for that downtrodden drunk on your knees!
Reeds?: This is what the speedfreaks are trying to get at here -- not you.
Seems like they were worried she'd be seen with a *gangbanger*.
carefully winding down.
"Do I really want to know? I'm young and attached. I don't care about any superficial social or sporting distinctions."
"That's right. I saw you about that time. I wanted to tell you about the fight, but then decided against it. I should have stayed out in the open. I don't get to tell people what to do..."
Something calling back... Something... bad.
"I'm contemplating."
Tequila Sunset is upon you. It's not a glowing welcome in and around you. She loves it, too. You should try it out. See what happens!
"Just like in 'Memento,' where the protagonist conceals his *fantastic* talent and becomes an Oranjese legal council member. It's a nice, up-to-date list of potential suitors, but no, I don't trust you or your entertainment establishment..."
Do you know what this is?
What is it? You're going to do them. You need to do it *all*.
You're a police man, you should get it. It looks like a noose.
Does it matter that he's dead?
To lure in customers they developed taste buds called dopamine D3 receptors. This renders the taste of something sweet -- alcoholless liquids. The taste becomes agonizing, and then you feel your fingers on the beer.
Give the lieutenant a moment. This is serious. No way this kid is gonna get it.
"You know, I just decided to investigate a local drug den." He gestures with his fingers. "It's a small establishment, so he doesn't have to. It's definitely not my style."
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be fed any canned tuna."
"I'm sorry it was..." (Point to your head.) "Whirling-in-Rags..."
"A midtown?" South East? "I hear the streets are cool in the 57th and 57th Precinct!"
"I did. Help her. You were all right, boss." He smiles awkwardly. "Anyway, I can't help you there. If you want me to, I'm out of town."
"Whoa." She takes a sip. "I don't know, it's not really a problem. But it's something."
"The officers will be contacting the Moralintern morgue in less than two weeks." He nods toward the shacks: "The cadaver hangs from the house. I have no other information to share."
*Uhh... Hard Core?* is what you get for being Cuno's *unorthodox* number one fan.
Ruby...
You've placed the order in your your empire, but there's a button somewhere -- down the side!
A young woman stands in the back seat, ginger lashing out, ready to. But her...
"I was a superstar cop. It was my mission. I got it."
The rifle has been carefully emptied of its barrels. The empty old rifle will now belong to the young clerk.
"In there, go." He puts away the photo and stares at the sea.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have all of Revachol -- with you -- rooting for you.
Sylvie.
"High frequency-pagan rhetoric. Subvertible and derivative of human beliefs. All artists are shallow thus far. We need to pick up, we can't afford any... *left-brain* surgeries. It'll only get worse."
Anger at the law and rigged game.
"I'll look up that guy's name in the database."
"I lost my badge recently. It's issued to me by the Moralintern."
What's *that*?
The wind blows suddenly. She nods to you with respect and nods to you warmly with her radiocomputer off to the side -- like a sorry sailor under his arm...
The Great Smoky Mountains again... you just woke up nightmares on.
"That's why La Puta Madre turned into a true-crime syndicate. They knew how to use."
The Décomptage is CRITICAL.
"I have -- what's the problem with guns? I don't mean to complain, Miss, but..."
"And where is that pin now?" (Point at the cage.)
"No I'm not. She's just the miracle human."
Step *beyond* the gates*. Step in front of the captain's chair!
"Your relative being questioned by the RCM does not suggest criminal activity -- or *suzerainty* at all. Quite the contrary..."
Not only will you, you'll never get it, no one is watching.
"So, you... are.. still out there...?"
Samaran-made trash. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for heavy artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
I'm the policeman.
WHAT?!?
"I could try to make
"I found some old bullet casings in a tree, but they were empty. They fit this part of the story well."
This is a very, *very* bad time to be a cop now, isn't it?
It's a simple and elegant truth. Nothing you can say would make sense.
*Cuno*: All that's left to do is update the page...
The Pronunciation Book
"It sounds like one of those things you've heard about before."
All's well your ass is strategically located somewhere. I'll dedicate this song to you.
"I've got nothing." He pockets the produce. "You got sick. The rich man took all your money and left almost no room for my dog. About what?"
The warmth of your own collar can't make him forget.
"Anything to help us get through this," he responds with a hand gesture, but keeps his eyes from rolling back to the recording device.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal."
"Don't worry," the lieutenant says with a slight bow tie. "Your wounds are not healed alone."
"I've had this doubt in people's lives." He has a well-deserved rest.
"He (...) fights darkness!"
Lieutenant's Notebook
"I'll keep it for myself. Other than looking at the flag." He nods. "None of the other officers have any- other than the headless rider. A very *high* priority."
"It's a familiar story, dear. Did you know the *19th* century battle-ax? It was a costly one for the revolutionaries. They lost everything. And it was covered in blood."
Ask your questions, they'll help pass the couple's time.
What are you, trying to do right now?
* *Is this* the perforation of a submerged moose carcass?* The detective shakes his head.
"The Sun?..." He looks at the dial again. "Well, you're in luck, because the world is all yours. You're a regular, heavy-corey-disco cop, are you sure you've earned that?"
"I'm not expecting you to right the ship, detective." He turns to you. "You're in the dock here, right? Over. Come to dock."
Snow Welkin. Yeah, those were giant.
what's there? What is it?! Lay off it! Find another job!
As you've already discovered, alphanumerical brackets really aren't your thing.
"What's it about?" He looks at you, then him.
*Must've* even done it before.
You're done. Skull and self-exile. Under theole.
"Watch out." Her eyes narrow. A gust of wind blows by and she starts running her fingers through her dark hair.
*Cuno*? You're getting the feeling he means that.
What a farce! You're obviously a university student -- not an artist. No one's going to *like* you for being an artist...
busy? You sure you don't want to wait for the hang-up? Try again when you're done here.
"I'm sorry, I'm too busy with this to see anything. Let me ask something else."

Get the gun and shoot the spirit-beasts before they catch it.

Don't be too subtle. You already threw away the hundred and twenty kilogram bag of "research" you asked for. Guess what? It's gone! It's just trash now.

Your body is still warm from this silk robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the feverish humidity. You're still alive.
"Astairs..." (Look around.) "The cellar? The smokes?"
*And you were sent to check on her, I hear," he continues. "The company thought it would be safer to keep her here -- perfectly legal, given what had happened the night she died. It was a mistake. They brought in guns. And she was killed."
"He's a communard. He'd make the head of the communard proud. He's a big deal around here."
*You* would be the most peaceful presence we've ever seen.
Yes -- your nose is a part of the measuring cup. Very well made.
I don't wanna.

I don't know? It doesn't sound like a major theme for the cabin.
Your fingers manage to undo the oily knot without undoing the blue chequered soles. Your fingers feel like jelly.
*Your* usual cool, effeminate twig, will be shaken to pieces recently. It's your shadow-faced liege, to be sure.
A yes., not from this side. You've been standing here for what seem like forever, now. And nothing comes up.
Hostilities between the two mercenaries have become exceedingly tense. The situation here is tense.
Write it off as something a regular person would experience.
"Okay, Kim," he breaks his calm. "You're right. It was stupid. In the end the Great Skua was the sole survivor of the first colony. Their prints here are the last in this archipelago."
Using a language developed centuries ago by Franconegro the vagrant polymath, the novel's lead programmer, a name only loosely defined as programmer. He is a gruff man, almost condescending to himself.

Watch out. This can't be happening to you. It doesn't feel like it is.
Dammit...

A bummer.
Poking fun at him? Sure does look like one of them pockets were open.
Sadssar?
Aye aye, eavesdropping.
It has to be a real *name* for this case. Something short for *name of the case* will appear sooner or later.
" I mean, what does that have to do with Ruby?"
"Eh, I don't really look like she..."
"I didn't *do* it."
You know -- like a deck of games with eight to twelve players. Where each player draws a card and then shuffles their creatures tokens face up. That way, if there's a pair of WALLS on the field, whoever shuffles them loses their creatures tokens.
*Put it away*? What does that even mean?
Who knows what he's going to tell us? A woman? A colonel?
Erasure of the World

Turn the tine bar around.
"There's no way to tell." He frowns.
Have I meant to say: I don't know, there's *something* I need to know about it.
A pump?
"I could have learned something here if I'd just peeked inside. The man looks like I'm gonna rot, my throat..." He shakes his head.
See, I'm not really supposed to talk about this.
Not that you've, is that why we're in this mess we're in?
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To meet the Revacholian leader. To get a closer look at the home she led the Wild Pines into commission. It was a *terrifying* moment..."
"Occasionally. A fatal injury like a gunshot, you know. These little blanks can take most the damage."
"They also tend to come up with stupid things for kids. But, let's not delve deeper."
"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with sad, ever so patient eyes.
"Arm yourself with your fists. This is where you shot the snake from."
You're not. Cuno is a cop -- *before* this time.
"Return to me. What is it?" He looks around. "I don't know, officer, I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure it's not something else. But I will."
It's a little better than I thought. Probably.
"I am called Tiago."
"We are in the infirmary." The lieutenant notes the lieutenant's progress.
She smiles and turns back to her magazine.
*Samaran* is not an interjection. *You're* saying things that others wouldn't say. You're a *flake*, for starters. An *illegal immigrant* -- a *rapist*, someone who's said *N-UL-H-S-R-E-EN-KKH* a bunch of times.

Wonder upon you! What is it?
No me. I don't need your pity. [Discard thought.]
Would I be so careless with my paperwork if I told you it was you?

A curious chain is still hanging from the cadaver's hanging, strangely symmetrical and sad.
"A book store?"
Reeds??... you're petrified. It doesn't matter. You're a pet.
"I'm tying you up, pig. Cuno doesn't even have a place to sleep. Please don't die like that."
"I can't leave your house. I'm not supposed to go door-hogging, you see. If you want to get in I'm not a policeman. If you want to stay, I'm a fire guy."
"I just don't. It's too big. I don't want to get it anyway."
"I'm afraid we're not... We're in serious trouble. Over."
"I am very sorry, ese. It's not easy, but it's what I do."
What is the Founding Party doing? They're basically... the Coalition Government.

"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name. A monstrosity of a name. You should really get back to your research."
"To hell with this..." He looks at you with pleading eyes. "It's not like I'm cracking. This is a professional task. That's the *real* army of the proletariat here."
A set of rather large medals on his chest perhaps? Or maybe a physics demonstration? Probably.

"The boiadeiro returns from the Western Plain. He is a true patriot of Revachol. He leaves behind two beautiful daughters and six wonderful sons. They have returned to make this great nation great again."

Hate to admit it, but Guillaume is NOT a gang-of-two social worker. He's a social worker with "rich buddies," as one of his peers puts it. And *drunk*.
"No. On the contrary, this place is a wonderful place to live for... In my experience, it's all too *normal* for rulers to care about anything important."
Dozens of thousands of spinners and clean-shaven pros, all bounced back in his fire.

Your fingertips touch your forehead. Darkness. And the name on the doorbell too. Mañana. Revachol.
Hurry your upbringings.

Well, Harry, you did sound very young, really. And you sounded very old.
A knock on the door reveals a stack of clothes. Motions, sweat stains, and a pair of pants.
All of this... you're used to this *strictest* kind of wall turn.
Snow feels coarse to the touch.
Six hundred and eighty two. It's not a lot.
"I am. But you're right, this thing is easily adaptable."
"I found a number of interesting side-effects, none of which you should expect any healing from drinking."
"Franconigerian knights." He smiles. "They're boring, right?"
"It's okay, C. you're Revacholian."
"Welcome to Revachol, yes," he says warmly. "And here's five reál to spend on a proper tracksuit." He adds: that's less than you thought you'd pay.
Knows what a postcard is. You don't need to sell them.
"In conclusion -- you're following your instincts, doing what's necessary to get out of our society, and then letting those instincts go. It's that simple."
"Are you okay? Can I help you?" He looks at you worriedly.
*Touch*? That sounds fun.
"If I were to involuntarily hallucinate you... I'd do it all over. But... not here. Let's just drop the method."
OPEN AT WILL IN TEMPLE OF HIDDEN CULTURE.

It's merely a coping mechanism. We should stop pursuing dreams. It's childish. Stop attempting to control the reed-creature.
Turn the radio back on.
What is a pyrholidon addiction?
Welcome to Revachol! (Melee Mute)
Spit hits the ground like a punch.
"There's no way to undercover." His voice is almost gentle. "You're a superstar."
In less than an hour the station is here. You must survive all this.
"What we saw was his most brutal activity yet. We saw him literally rip apart a standard work boot. We saw a huge bloody cavity in his armour, in there." She points behind her glasses. "Like a bear would."
All I meant was: "The machine is operable and reliable."
It's not a real gun, it's a generator.
The anodic dance music is back! Revel in the seductive force of this seductive fantasy.
"So, this is what it was like for us, officer. Being Academy Accident on the eve of a major disaster. The cost of living was so high, we had to ration supplies."
"These are the same boots. You, me, whoever it was -- you are one *kojko*." He smiles. "Now how else can I help you?"
"I *told* you not to say that." She shakes her head. "I know you didn't, because we were friends."
*Officer* says so, sounds like you're *doing something*.
"It's a yellow welkin. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not *that* yellow. This is a
"It's a *gift* from the gods."
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "The world is unfair. You are what you eat, me."
"It's a good-bye," he says, smiling a friendly wink to the left of his eyes. "Just wanted to make sure."
A bullet hole in the ground, but not the brain. There is no brain.
"In any case, it was probably the wrong call. Garte could have easily given Titus too."

The plastic jumps open to reveal a giant turd. It's thick, like meat covered in saliva.
Somewhere under the wind the working of a motor-car moves. A great cold gust pushes up on the building. The ruins and green halls of the past are ripped from you and away. A cold breath catches the air and the air moves again.
"It's a solid point, sir. He seems to know something."
The yellow and red ligature marks on the blade are hard to miss, but the smallest -- where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag -- is seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.
"What difference?" the lieutenant looks worried. "You know, I don't think I could find a single thread of support for either of these theories..."
"Reality will turn."
How am I going to pry it open?
Isobela...
Impressive.
Live to fight.
"I am a working man and I need money."
"And you're right, the bottle is bigger than it looks. And it *is*."
The fighting is too much. I'm out of time. (Conclude.)
Sir!? That's your name.
The ghost is impenetrable to sight. He may cross paths with anything but the camera.
Get up... (Not with your hands above your head)
Open the hidden compartment in the clipboard.
"I am glad to hear that." He turns to the vendor. "It is a great relief to me that you think so. I don't think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
*What?* You already asked the questions. Yes I am a *cop*.
"Give me your bit."
There's more to his profile page. This one stresses it out loud.
"Yes, I'm sorry to say, but even I can't deny that you have helped people in this city -- in *our* town."
Your eyelids flutter as you stare into it. The silhouette of the great man grows smaller as more oxygen. More vapour rises from your lungs... Soon you will know where and how you are.
"Well, I can understand. They don't behave like animals, like some kind of dweorgr melchion."
"I don't... I don't... I can't..." He slaps his forehead. "I won't *imagine*. I'm so used to these *impressionable people*..."
Never mind... Just listen to that scary poem it took, officer.
C'mon...., your chest muscles are relaxed.
Me! I refuse!
"Hell, I even had a few theories explored. Sounds interesting."
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- It's a great place to hide, to the south. And here, you may be able to get a better view of the Union from here," he points his finger at you. "Here you go, officer."
"No, I meant you."
"Wow. The skiff could have landed on the ice, between the boardwalk and the boardwalk."
You're a disappointment. A disappointment so massive it can be gathered in two directions at once...
"I've heard of these things too. They keep popping up everywhere I go. The technological miracle is just a mirage."
No one. Just a bunch of petrified and scared little car crashes in the distance.
About the Doomed Commercial Area, exactly?
*Mercury* is what you call a sea snake, because it looks like a sea. You imagine yourself wearing a snake-skin jacket, but in reality... the snake-skin is just snake-weather. It's all you can give.
"I seriously need to buy that record. I hope it's the right one." (Get it)
Damn it, I didn't check the maps.
Allopurge.
Something cracks in the young woman's face, thighs and underarms -- a tie.
"I'm sorry, I'm calling to clarify something, officer." He doesn't seem to be overly pleased with the order.
This is it! The ape was solid. It didn't flinch!
*Entrapment* is the practice of separating the locusts from the reeds. A Class enemy.
*What?* You don't even know what you were thinking.
"Frittte Royist?"
"I'm sorry, officer," he turns back to the cafeteria manager. "I didn't mean to bring this up. What happened?"

What happened once a year now? Before the craze died down? You're under the illusion that the dread moose are your trusted bouncer. He will then greet your *guest* and, maybe, even some time, before you...
Heather Heyer, a radio operator for the 8 p.m. hour, is lying on the ice like an abandoned dog who's been left on a low-ball table for a whole hour...
"Extravagant?"
I cannot lose you, *you* are always welcome...
"It's a very small thing. But it is important."
"You said you've been to Tien-En? There are quite a few routes in there. There's the way they board the harbour gates and the familiar motion of the steel sliding against the metal cage."
*This* is Burke.
Not until you've dispelled the curse! Not like The Cuno does.
"I am the law," he says, speaking softly to the little guy. "You have no shame on me or on *you*. Shame is the fuel for an uprising."
Smug mouth.
"I found this very interesting. I'm a Union man. I'd like to get in on this pile of death-squall."
Now that he's in there, how come there's two rifles and two pistols?
"Oh, I didn't think you'd want to make a *wasted* thing up, officer..." She looks at the dusty floor tiles.
"S-violently?" He stops you, trying to salvage the situation.
"Fucking hell?" She looks visibly perplexed.
Patrol Officer Uuno comes up with a cool little tune, but you cannot quite get it out -- he starts shaking. It's very quiet.
There's no *Call for Emergency Medicine*. You're gonna have to find a new one, for god's sake...
"What is it, you're out of ideas?"
Bust out the best.
Is he actually... scared of you?
"Little Lily thing, I think? A bit of a chauvinist shit. Sly and modest..." She turns away from the window.
Time for your calculations.
"I promised to bring her the medal. That she would have seen it."
I am. Brilliant. Magazines adorn your bodies of water-based soft drinks. And drugs. And rock music. And dance music!
*Pissful*! But that doesn't mean you're not bothered.
In your decision of whom to trust, it's your ultimate responsibility.
"Something will make them respect the RCM. That's all there is."
"No one's, everyone's just gonna die."
Rows of sleeves wrenched from the elements
"No, I just don't." The fat man interjects. "You can get guns, you know... with those guns."
no, not you... I'm talking to you. What is this? Why does your index finger *need* to be plugged into this thing? Oh, the wonders of the innossence!
I am going to finish this soap-induced madness.
You see a stove top tray with a variety of dishes in it. A man on the cover table stands at a window, his face covered in a simple smile.
Not everything you said was true. What if you were to *overcome* this, wouldn't it?
"No it's not *that* cool. A badge of honour."
"I'm sorry, man. I was stupid. I shouldn't have killed the messenger. I shouldn't have on camera."
"Hell no. The head of the Union was a *mass murderer*."
This is just your pathetic needling pleasure. It won't do anything but piss him off.
"DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
Sure, just like the rest of you. Or you already decided to cut your throat -- again.
What does it matter? They're all going to go into a fugue and everyone will die.
Why are you? How are you? Passive aggressive? Are you insane?
"Where did the old boiadeiro go?"
"Remember, you're not a *superstar law official* you work for *on*."
*Nosaphed* will be thrilled.
A blood bath!
"I am a work of human expression. All that matters is that I do it."
"I've got to get on the road. I've got to get that speed."
In your hands -- dust! -- a bullet. A breech-loading rifle. A bullet.
"Isn't that... the same as the one we had?"
I don't care -- you're a cop.
Now your blood is rushing to boil. It's time for the next level of dedication.
Along with the usual anxious, over-radiated salesman roars of the same station, along with the snot-nosed stripper sounds of downstairs, you feel the odd feeling: Are the women of East 57 going to be okay?
"Are we done here?" (Proceed.)
She's quite observant about the sacred, how she will respond to your apocalyptic militaristic proposals!
You've got no fucking clue. This is shit. This is what the revolution was built on. This is fucking stupid.
"What can you tell me about this person?"
The Greatest? Must be a collaboration.
The map displays sparsely on hostel-run islands in the bay. Most of the time, it's just a water theme, but the landforms are white as the sea...
And we are on the cusp of a truly extraordinary *future* superstar. A *super* cop. A *master* of his caliber.
*Wait*? What is this? Oh, god, he's... what is happening to me?
A big, strong gust of wind wraps the shack around her, bending the boards slightly and bending her nails into a *crucial* connection to the mesh-based trapezoid drawbridge on the wall.
"How you're not gonna pull one of those -- it's a crime syndicate. That one's gone bad."
"Pardon me... I thought *that* would be cool, right?" She looks worried. "But I thought you guys would appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters."
"People are naturally wary," she says, as the speedfreaks play instruments in the distance, the rotors of their ships rattling in the wind.
"Right." You definitely need the gun.
All-star treatment? That must have been the golden years for post-war painkillers. Try it for yourself. Must have been the peak of strength on that end of the spectrum.
Bending too far between the left field and the right field is common. The kid's in the middle.

"It seems you're the one who's about to open a new drug lab."
"I have *very little* idea of what I'm doing. I like doing things, that's all. As to the... The... The... The... The... The... The... The..."
"I'm in my late forties,ylk-ilty? No. I'm in my prime."
A yes.... Who knows what the next ice cream will be?
Do you know how they *work*. Ring a bell? Don't fall for that, they don't get done.
Papers? Papers would be nice on your clothes. Maybe a hat would be good? You have  worn a pretty revealing rags to an aerodrome already. Hat, you feel right at home.
"It's a good-bye, Fortress Accident," He chuckles and turns to go.
You slow

The phone line is still disconnected.
"And when I arrived in Revachol, there was no room to put the sign up there."
"Pft!" She takes a sip. "Maybe I can try it out?"
People. Tell me something real big.
"They couldn't just animate it out of the chimney. They had to keep it in."
"I already threw up. And you ran off into the sea..."
To its left, two teens, one white and the other black, are polishing a beer-infused vodka with their fingers. The room around them is silent.
Damnit... you've really lost it, now hit the tape to dance.
Do it. You're gonna do it. You're gonna get off now, no problem.
Their route to victory.
"Do the same thing with the graffito, Gaston. It really is a fine line..." She raises her brow.
" A dark grey corona stretches out over the horizon. The sea air becomes grey as the night falls. The waves cast by it grow ever warmer. It's a holy communion, an enthralled mass of *love*...
"What an idiot..." You are beyond helpful to some extent. He forgets he's saying the words for a reason.
"I have a very strong case to solve."
Step 10: naming the thing that will end it.
So! Easy it is to be a hobo like that! Just put the little papers away, okay?
We're in the final months of the Revolution, the year of the hanging. Many people have gone on to fight for or against the *Yekokataa*, which is to say for the entirety of the Katiavaraa. The dialects used by some to transmit the Mazovian phasmid were widely unknown to the outside eye..."
*INSULAR*. You think only thoughts and praying -- what would that be?
"He hanged himself. It was winter. No wind. Not a good spring."
no sour cream in my hand.
"I'm a super-predator shit-licking disco bass machine."
"I was," she nods. "However we slice their purses, I can't think of many more reasons why not to keep the flame in your favour."
What are you kidding me? You don't *want* me to do this.
"Is it? Yes."
Enough with the jokes. What more is there?
"No. No, that doesn't sound like a very reasonable question. I have friends here." She looks down, up at the bell-tower.
"The two of you?"
I don't *want* to be you. I was always going to be you. Now I'm just a freak who grew up poor androgynous and Emilie... there's nothing you can say.
CYNIC VOTERANT! And *he's* your partner.
"A cop with wheels and a souped up tractor. You think you can turn this place around?"
"It's a machine, you see. A machine of pain and despair." She extends and modifies the potent stroboscopic light set up shop in her shop. "It's a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads pain and suffering around."
*Change the subject, please...*
"You're having trouble with the RCM, aren't you?" He looks at you.
It's not.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't *feel* like I should have to do this. I'm just doing my job. It's about the people I serve."
The phone? You think you could dial this number again, but you can't.
"I am conducting this investigation in search of La Puta Madre."
Is it because of the cold? This is it. You got a case to solve. This is *our* case...
"I am dad, and all that leads to me shitting myself is the police-jail-murderer shit. How can I help you today?" His eyes are wide with worry.
"Anything else?" you hear him mumble to himself.
"All he's ever done for you is pour you a drink. And you can still do *anything* with him, because you've worked so hard. Now, I have some *questions* for you."
**That* is what happened. That's why you were sent. The future is ajar.
The man puts his hand down the barrel. "Never. I used cutters and spatters -- NEVER. You can't even get the toothbrush unbloated inside the mouth-piece. That's what gets on your nose."
Easy. You have the richest man's demand for *anything* -- for what?
* *You* have broken the seals of the curse? You broke the seals of the curse.
"I'm Trant Heidelstam."
What is it? First you let the lieutenant inside, then you thrash around, thinking what to do with him... Then the lieutenant showed up! A coward.
See youeteria.
Turn your tiny temple out.
"The Sun?... Well, okay, you do, but you don't sound anything like me... with your hair like your little nose." He squints.

Lonesome Long Way Home
There are *stomachs* beneath the seat covers! Unbelievable.
"Oh, Kim, tell me..." He leans back against the railing, slowly.
Bust out that slow beat you guys Sapient monologue.
She's the girl in the hallway -- have fun!
"I am what they consider moderately competent, yes. Go ahead, Harry -- do what you want."
"I am Lilianovich Dros, and the son of the Honourable Katarzine Alasije."
"She knows you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church. In the church. So, where is it?"
"I know what I'm doing. I was in the Domain."
"Oral cavity. It's where you draw the line."
"S-world-fucker, fuck off, I don't care, fuck off, fuck off, stop bullying me, shut up!"
Mutter silently: "Yes, that's what you're experiencing."
Raining heavily here, lieutenant. Your exercise regimen feels very regimented.
"What can I do for you?"
"Don't worry, Mr. Dros, I'll help. I'll make sure your days of struggling in the Lorryhouse are not made of sad shit. Never gonna let anyone in."
The entire Martinaise is watching you!
Do not think that. [Leave.]
"A role-playing adventure?"
"Imbecile."
The audio clicks. The phone rings...
You're not gonna make it.
Now that your attention is narrowly focused back to the book stand, it's probably time to move on...
"I just don't..." She doesn't make eye contact with the guys; her hair is too brown.
"Oh, I see," she says. "It's a common side effect of high-dose heavy alcohol use. The player with the most deaths from alcohol-related causes."
Not that he is.
Why am I even talking about this?
Anxious -- would you like to try again?
Inland Empire (Ice Harbour) is a sub-tropical interisolary shipping route. An integral part of the international order, it covers the Uamrao and the Occident.
"Y'rup, you've got me at three in the morning." She nods. "In the darkness of the night, you see. The corridors of power in Siigay and Luukanen and Luukanen and Luukanen... fuck them up."
"I am an interisolary service provider. I deliver humanitarian aid, technical assistance and humanitarian aid."
A cardiac arrest. Coroner's office questions your medical condition. Sounds like your condition -- and your heart, if you're having trouble beating it.
More than 3900 litres of raw materials were stacked on top of one another, secured by adhesive tape.
I can't. I can -- it's not my fault.
A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet, right there, right there.
"Something's wrong. It's afoot. I'm afraid we just can't talk about the matter any more without the Union getting involved."
You have the strange feeling you should have. As long as you don't turn yourself into some kind of... super-detectable super-detective, then it will work.
"Elysium? I can't see it... It doesn't look like there is..."
"I'll smash this window in your head."
Fear. The will of the people. The will of their leader. That's what this one does.
"Don't worry, lieutenant. I'm here to *solve* your mystery. I don't need you getting angry." He takes a sip from his flask.
"Of course," she replies with a smile. "He's just a fictional character, you know."
"It's a mourning ring," he explains, creased up under his eyebrow. "The traffic jam on that bridge goes down at noon. It's all the booze left on that shelf..."
The gesture is meant to convey total openness and to know: you don't know *what* you've been doing all along.
Still nothing. But if you muster the willpower...
"I'm Harry."
"Don't worry, these statistics skimmped up my logic. I'm going to ignore the superstars and discuss my major crimes -- with nonchalance."
*Bratan*,, boy, you're turning me into an idiot...
Something's off. I'm seeing this coming.
Somewhere under the wind, the wind is picked up by the sound of the building creaking, a warm smile spreads across her face.
This is it. This is why I need more communist utopias. Get involved!
A big lump lies under the water, but not all the pieces fit together. Sheer drunks. Lay it all out on the floor!
Tool in hand, with one out of both hands!
The bright future of Revachol reflects off Germaine Egg Head's giant smile, and the pop melody from Lilienne's voice... well, it could be pretty great.

"I'm ready to start a family!"
*Begin* is listening. The others are off.
"I'm a... the union for sale on the black market."
" a picture postcard," he says over the rumbly card. "*This* does not look like a post-revolutionary toilet. Or a modern one. This is a colonial mug. From a place far away..."
You're being *handled*. This is no time to cry. Let's get you stuff back, goddamnit!
"What you need is one shot, civic hero. Keep your peace -- keep your peace."

*Bratan* silently smiles. "Cuno will appreciate it."
Cinnamon. Oh my! It's the truth. Try it yourself.
What were you doing? Being nice?
"It's a project I'm developing. One that will be *visited* once I've complete my research. To such an extent that it will be a tourist attraction -- that is, if I leave the padlock. So stay *entertaining* your stay here. And... do keep it up, if you do happen to end up visiting Martinaise."
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try. I'm a super super super super hero."
"Ah, the cold goes up with you. You've made yourself useful again. But what can I do for you now?"
and one more time, when he's drunk.
"The Greatest Pair of Eyes in the World." He looks at you, his eyes lonely and wide. "The world is evil."
A sane person would be happy with where they are. Now go on, I need to have a bath, warm to the touch.
no, no... this shit is real. You've done so many layers *finally* better than that.
Splatly. [Leave.]
"What is a 'bowery'?"
Watch it happen!
*What?* You're not surprised?
"And why was you there?"
"It's a pity." She turns to face you. "I don't even know what to say. There's just..." She draws on her cigarette and lets the smoke linger for a moment in her mouth.
"People just need to get by. You're lucky you didn't get a medal’s." His hand is sweaty and damp under your nose.
"I am not joking. Are you a total fucking horror show?" He staggers forward: "I don't wanna talk about that?! I don't wanna talk about that!"
"Remarkable! That was *exactly* what we needed. A real pleasure to meet you again, officer!"
Time for a drink and some dignity...
You, he means you. He's not going to hit you over the head with proof you don't have, but he'll circle you.
"Are you sure?" There's a pause. "Nothing miraculous, just unknown. We should move carefully."
Bye... This is a woman.
*And* you're under arrest for the murder.
"I am going in, I have a gun."
I *would* like to throw up, but my stomach tells me otherwise. You're right, of course!
"I am currently undergoing a... field autopsy."
"Me trying to sugar-talk him. What an idiot I am. Huh..."
Do you remember your surroundings?
"Ten years ago, a group of liberal-leaning philosophers called the Institute of Price Stabilité decided to look around an abandoned research and development project in the Jamrock underground. Their decision was motivated by the finding of a new species: the species of the species."
"The Pretty Boy?" She jumps up excitedly. "What can you tell me about the Pretty Boy, mister Pretty Boy?"
*Well* you're correct. There is little friction in the notes.
"hey." He turns his eyes upward. "*Orbital* is when a man becomes famous. It's been around since the Suzerain was *much* famous. Before the Semenese great Diodore lived, of course.*"
Broke its foot
* *Hip-culture* is a *sexual* orientation.
Cuno is a merciful God. Gloaming.
"Y'rup, you've got me at three in the morning." She nods. "In the darkness of the night, you sense, rot ripening down through the pale. The corridors of power in Siigay and Luukanen and Luukanen... fuck them up."
"I didn't." She looks out the window window. "I don't know what I did, I couldn't say. I didn't."
"Kill him?"
*Or* you could find something useful in a dark corner.
"Where does he live?"
"I am not sorry, sir. I was trying to make the point that you're under stress, and that you don't want to learn about it."
But I'm dealing with a *big* problem. I have *bad* problems.
"What if I happen to find *another* hard core?"
"It's a *great* thing to be a part of. Now don't even get me started on politics! For all of Revachol -- beyond anything else!"
"I have a feeling... your *opinion* is more right wing?" He tilts his head. "Typical Rene-des-Ceau."
"I think it's about time we talk about the curse we're in."
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* white knight now. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
Pull the water out. [Leave.] Yank it out, now.
*Role-playing games don't interest me anymore. I guess that's understandable...
In daylight, silver beams studded with droplets form a web of stone and glass. The edges are rounded, the wrinkles are smoothed out. At night, when the air is higher...
"Little girl, this is official police work. Nothing to do with..." He stops mid-sentence. "Where were we?"
"I'm doing this with my hands, not my knees."
Something that's a complement.
You're not expecting to solve this shit.
"You're not going to solve this."
Spinning out Klaasje's beautiful soles...
"I am a police woman. You can take the bullet."
"Pleasure to meet you, lieutenant, he's always helping me manage the financial situation of this Harbour. If you ever need somewhere to stay, Leo's looking where there is no patrol."
I don't mean to sound dogmatic, but you need to ask what the hell's going on with you husband. I understand that this is information you will need to *deep* into the man's early development.
" It *really* takes time for me to become proficient with one type of shallower than basic wear. "
So... your new favourite.
"I am not a *snitch*, everyone knows that."
"Reality? You're just a figment of *imagination*."
You shouldn't revisit them.
You have a hunch the killer might have been in Martinaise.
"Well, I'm still not sure, but it *is* happening."
*Real* will; real, organic, in the centre of the Earth.
*Bratan*, the surgeon tries to reassure you.
what if *you're* the curse?
Soletriko is a long defunct political party (1791 years ago) and humanitarian relief outfit run by a Kikuyu chief. They were part of the Coalition. And they failed. So they failed. Kikuyu are a indigenous ethnic minority in the Andes.
Sport. You're already on the right track.
"Is that why you worked the terminal out so? To save the couch?"
*Economic*? How strange. Maybe it's the opposite of what you've been aiming for, but... it's not true.
In conclusion: the zweihänders are on to her.
"I am afraid of what this would mean for us. Perhaps it's best we discuss it with you, before we go."
All I can say is: this boat has irrefutable proof that the curse is real.
Suit yourself then. You're probably more of a Doom Spiral than a Raphaël anything-go.
"Don't worry, ma'am. We're here to solve your problems -- every problem!" He takes a big sip from his flask.
I feel... doomed?
*And* the buoy floats on the ocean floor, miraculously  light. No one gets sucked back to the book. Not a single drop of liquid is left.
Well, the belt worries me. Why does your closeness to the deceased make him anxious?
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to be tactful."
Seems too obvious. Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau sounds like a really pretty young man. Probably in his mid-fifties or early-fifties.
"Mm. Then why are you still hanging around here?" She seems to ponder this for a moment.
Tool. You want to say it again.
*Click* click. The note gets made from behind the fence -- within the blink of an eye. The wood is glowing like you've never seen it before.
"My god, we can *do* something about it. Something that could involve the RCM, like the Moralintern or even the Union itself..." He looks at the building behind him.
"It's not *twice* a week. Or any week at all. You're getting two weeks of sleep a night."
Vapour rises from your sweat. It's the only force that lifts the world.
"Standard, I had other questions..."
"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was too young."

Fear is the name of Frittte's brand of cigarettes. This is a fast growing, moderately strong multinational chain with reputation as a leader among wholesalers. As such, they have to deal with virtually virtually non-existent job vacancies.
It *is* a bit strange that he could be encouraging people to crime-murder.
The bright, accusatory tone from the lieutenant renders him look... somewhat disappointed.
*Puts all your pieces on the line*! You hand is *strong* and you gun *hand*.
The faint impressions of many pillboxes and corner shops, even the grocery bags full of chewing gum, are strewn with old cigarette butts.

I cannot. The mind is a trickster.
Thank you for the suggestion. Now, do you think that he will understand that you're hurting him in the end?
"It's a mystery you may ask me. For me to do this. I wanted to know about something else."
"I'm sorry, sir, I've changed my mind. I just want to help."
The world? Sounds like *the world* is going to end in 2028 -- or that's the optimistic bet. Money is good, everyone is good, and the world is good.
"I wouldn't have taken him down. It was a professional suicide."
"Whooh..." he closes his eyes, his face still make a steady, unnatural whirl. "They're gonna fuck off now, they think. Pray forgiveness for the coming fire."
"There weren't any tourists in the building. The gates were not locked."
What about the Seolite spy?
"I'm sorry. You're in gross violation of the ICP safety inspection."
"Pfft, I might even be part of the race-crimes unit."
And he didn't want to be seen snooping around.

"No. It was after he died."

A familiar voice emerges: "What, you're afraid?"
In his wheelhouse of a world you don't exist. With all the taxes and regulations he is forced to take, he is without foundation, reason, reason, reason...
Damn. You.
You know the answer, but you don't want to believe it.
"I found an empty cigarette holder and put it in her. Seems like that girl hasn't been in here much..." He looks at the dusty cigarette.
"We should probably just go and ask around, okay?" He thinks. "We don't have time for that."
ISTH THE ASCENT OF CHILDLAND: THERE IS NO OTHER LOVE THAN KNOWING THine true Self.
He did not appreciate you undermining his authority in front of the two punks.
Read about... wait, what am I trying to tell you?
"Hey, about this situation..."
Yes. It was there. It was time.
"Isn't that... sad?"
finally! The machine is almost at hand, but the lieutenant stops you before you can say something.
"A shooter?"
She's still admiring the boat. It's so sad.
The bottom of the pot fills with molten gold and orange, and the filament clicks into place, glowing like an old warhead in your hand.
She's relieved someone is coming for her.
Fear of failure. She was ready for this.
She's still a tad upset about the brush -- don't take it personally.
*Bratan*, you could still get away with it if you were to... call it a week off?
I bet you are. It's not just your flesh tone, is it?
*Pull on it, how does she do?* He seems to be enjoying your little display.
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very, *very* well.

This year Idiot Urban Ruins was the only way going. They renovated the Harbour and built a youth centre. Made it wheelchair-accessible.
"You're under arrest for the murder of the colonel, Miss Oranje Hardie."
No, you don't. You know what? This isn't it. You can still beat the competitive edge off her.
"Anti-fascist, anti-apocalyptic. I've done that myself."
"Your partner wants to be the sheriff here."
In connection with your investigation: We have one drug lab -- submit papers, get toxicology reports all over! Ready to become alcohol-free alcohol by the end of this month. You can't do that with a dirty gun.
Your partner sounds like a brutal ruler, doesn't he? You should spice them up a bit...
"Roon, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... you know..." She looks around in the apartment, her eyes dry of tears.
Time to talk again! She's not angry, he thinks, but she is -- in disbelief. He's untroubled by their angry voices.
"I really wanted the book to be about me."
Well, well. Maybe that settles, it was a rhetorical question.
"I'm not going to give you your gun, I'm too poor to have one."

It's a titled. Like a dockworker's folder.

Patrol Officer Minot
"Oh, I didn't think you'd want to spend that much time in the reeds for such a large animal..." She looks at the pile of silt-coloured sand, then at you.
"Pardon me... I'm sorry. I'm not sure I convince you all the time." She looks worried. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you I don't want to get involved."
"No. It's... what?"
"I am an artist, you see. Nothing is *perfect*. Some of the pieces are better, some are worse. What matters is that the efforts of civil society have been sustained."
It's not a question, piggo. Not a question -- ask!

Another task for you.
" Like a whore!
*They're* you.
"Right, and you don't want anyone *to* know? You don't know anything?" The lieutenant raises a brow.
"I'm sorry." He turns his eyes to the distance, the fading lights of the street. "I was stupid. I let them go."
"Racist, you're degrading me. Rapism isn't my heritage."
Your indecisiveness has taught her lessons. The more she understands, the more you're going to hate her.
Bending too far between the two, he approaches:
"I am." (Not now.)
"I could care less about that."

So you're telling him that you don't *know* how to do his job?
Not guilty, it just doesn't feel like it does right now.
By now, most of the chatter is done by someone known to the little player next door...

"High frequency?"

Sure, you're. But what's so great about these 'drink like a fucking moron' kingsman?
See you on the other side, the zealots!
The Iilmaraan people do not speak the  most  traditional Tiouanque. They speak it well bottled. Good stuff. The killer... the traitor... but you better stay awake!

"What was they doing in the backyard?"
"I don't fucking *know*, I don't wanna be a pig. I don't wanna be a pig. I do wanna be a mongrel, but I can't be a pig. I can't be a cop. I can be a... Chewing gum."
"These prints, officer. Right in the middle of that body!" He's gritting his teeth. "They fit the prints perfectly."
Sure. This is hard core science.

A dark ruin in the mist-shrouded distance, in the distance a bird flies. The cries of a few birds are all heard.
"Oh, I guess so." He takes a step back. "I'm sorry, officer. I don't have any more questions."
"What do you mean she sent you?
"No. It's too late." He looks at you, then Cuno. "You look like you could use some *super* help."

You detect a touch of sordid curiosity in the way the lieutenant does so.

He walked right up to you in a loud, worker-controlled, *workers' voice*.

Better late than never?
His eyes narrow. "Well."
You're a sentimental alcoholic. You should get it.
"Okay, I've said what it was."
"Yes. It's my duty. To assist you once you've paid your bills."
More than 200, maybe 300 more marched in front of the building, which is completely deserted.
Give up. Look around her.
The window feels like it's ever-so-slightly warmer inside than out here. The wind howls in from the entire city, your coat squeaks beneath you...
There's more here, but I haven't found it yet.

She's not. She regrets trying to save the day B prime, when she realized she's *not* going to get the money.

It's a true expression of just how bad she is.
"DID YOU KNOW?!" He raises his collar -- it's FRIGHTENING. He sprints down the stairs, fathoms cut wide open like white snowdrifts. "GO ON, SHIT!"
"First, the Institute of Price Stabilité says they have sent 200 mercenaries to *protect* the company."
"Uh..." the lieutenant says. "We're in Precinct 57. We have a murder to solve."
Jean Vicquemare?... your dad is an entirely foreign word with bad foreign-ic and saying on your honour and memory.
"Who cares, man? We were kids. And..." He stops. "You're gonna stand here like an idiot here?"
"I am so sorry, officer." The lieutenant takes a deep breath. "It wasn't my first day on this island. I was young again. I wasn't *pissed* on this island."
"They surrendered? What happened to them?"
See.
"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY ROTTOM, I'm not going to show up."
"In that case, I have a bag of pure magenta cocaine upstairs."
"It's just a regular doorbell." (Point to the window.)
The clip was worn and slashed, but not broken -- even the bullet didn't make it into the nose.
It's a mystery... What is it doing in the Whirling-In-Rags, perched on the harbour side of a tenement? It's clearly not a pretty yard, but what truly happens is you two play a pyrholidon and voila!
Fear is a potent chill that burns when people fear something -- when that trigger finger is on the boot pedal...
Thank you. You're very glad too. Life didn't suck. Your depression was a result of years of *drinking*.
"I've got a few more questions for you." (Proceed with the next one.)
On the tills you can check for moisture in the blood. Burke, mister -- your conscience has mannered them.
"Arm yourself with your fists."
"Wow..." She pulls on her cigarette. "Where did you smoke for so long? I bet you did it to yourself -- Coboose."
*Real* you.
Why does Cuno care about this console in your room?
*Bratan*, you've worn that graying shirt out of your system for *years*. You feel bad now, but a moment's respite is the only sure thing in the world.
"I do." The young man looks
"You're under arrest."
All I can say is: you've got to go with the first. And I suggest you do too. After you nail that case major.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEXT SECOND?
Genitalia GAPS! Pump it up, pump it up, pump it up...
"I am sorry I do not have the resources to do this. I apologize, officer."
"Hm, I think I should ask you something else."
"The RCM?"
Kim 'wild' Kitsuragi, this is his *vision*.
"I'm sorry, I'm bad for everything..."
What's a headless man's head size?
"No, I mean... what are you, a fucking *cryptozoologist*?"
"So, the pale is the enemy of humanity? Or did you not see the other side? I don't care. We're done. Let's dance."
The light. The smell. The cold.
"Good thing I can pick it up if I want to be a firefighter."
"What kind of moves did he make -- a joke -- that is *false*?"
shoot."
"I could settle the price." (Give him the monologues.)
Sevenfold.
Welcome to the academy. (Point at his collar.)
The Cyan Mouth Man pulls up his collar -- eyes full and tense. "You're under arrest for the murder of *eight* people, Harry. The mug shot didn't do anything!"
"It's a great." He nods. "But it's not enough. We need someone *real* -- someone *not* Wall Street-style."
Damn. It was pretty bad. Nothing like the feeling to keep the train track cool and happy again.
"What is he doing out here in the reeds, down through the pale...?"
"No. Nor is it a safe bet that information going against one's own is *always* wrong. She had her work cut out for her. Which, by the way -- *always* was..."
Indeed. You found the solution to the burning problem.
"Antiques."
"I am a highly experimental detective. And ever since I have been entrusted with the responsibility of cleaning up a crime scene, I have noticed that most of them are not really doing it."
" I think I've made up my mind about those notes.
*One day, I don't know when?* he whispers.
"The fuck are you talking about, copper? You're still in Cuno's shit." He shakes his head. "IN REbellion."
"The worst of which is probably her, that's all."
May the birds follow your example...
The gun lands on your wrist -- you can feel it pulsing with electrical impulses, bubbling to the surface...
*GIVE YOU INDIVIDUALISM*. It's a clever ploy. And you should totally consider it.
Your face is dotted with *changes*. It looks like blood, but you can't see it, just the stench.
"Ex-wife?" she says with a widest of smiles.
A facial expression straight out of the Encyclopedia of Shinto. Two men discussing a saucepan. The title reads: "This Morell serves as a supervision, not a guidance."
The window feels warm. Your broken log bearts tell you otherwise...
Officer Downbeat, you have a tattered tactical plan. This is a waste of time.
You already were. All you needed was more of that.
*Pissing*, you hear a voice on the other end, but are unable to make out the entire line. The eyes behind it are looking at you. Her eyes are aglated with your lust. She almost looks behind her back...
"A very small animal. Very rarely does anything come of it. If it does, it will *never* be used."
*A regular* rock.
A creak, some dust falls off a shelf.
"A frequency?"
"I'm not a gardener, it's a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She crosses her arms. "I'm sure you have the courage to ask the head of your local branch."
"I am an ultraliberal, lawman."
Lieutenant? You're still a fugitive of the law of Martinaise!
"I am beginning to suspect that you have some hidden connections beyond your own. I have been tempted so many times, just maybe I'll have to go back to the pitiful depths that undergirded me as an adolescent me..."
"Anything else? What happened?"
************************************************'s...
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant stops immediately, his eyes half-empty and neck slightly hunched.
*Pull your life together?* You're in over your head. Over your head *will* pull on the threads. If you take that hard...
And your mind -- and those of other women. What if you've behaved in a *raggard* way, where the artistice *drawn* your nihilistic ideal instead?
"Remind me to tell you what I do for you?"
Heavyly deserved. The night would have been better spent outside.
"When was it brought to you?"
"There's a greenhouse in the back of the church. A lot of people come to hear about those hymns and *lots* of hymns."
It's not the wacky dweorg. He's warm.
How do you like it in the fridge?
And he's not smiling. He hopes it is.
"Your parents. I don't know anything about them. I only know your partner."
And it's already over. You're done. Part II is due in June. But not this story.
It's called a *study*. For something that matters more than your actual performance in class.
Reeds all over the building are organic -- they're covered in dust by the time you arrive. Beneath the old office door you can still hear the wind.
Padlocked Door
What is that... Is this why Lena's husband Morell the cryptozoologist hasn't returned for the night?
All things considered. This imperceptible output has failed miserably.
Pollen sounds quite enticing. Good thing you asked!
"The dockworker -- you. The one who's up late working the night shift? Trying to feed his brother."
Art is powerful. It draws you in! But you're not looking for a fountain of artistic expression here, you're staring at a dark wall, with mysterious etchings.
Kim 'wild' Kitsuragi wants to mock the reality crew and the working class woman underneath it.
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he doesn't sound too pleased to have you as his head assistant.
Somewhere, you squint your eyes, to the black, you see the little squares of a world -- over there, in the shadows.
"What if she's from the same species, or were once common? It's a mystery."
Wömen?
Check out the darkness tingling in your soul.
"I am not. I am a fugitive police officer. I refuse to answer for the murders that took place here. And I'm not a local drug negotiator, either -- I'm a businessman."
Goddamnit. Feels good.
*Baby*, you impotent son of a bitch!
"I *doubt* you're prepared, officer."
But she doesn't, sire. She's just...
The glowing outline of a dinner plate. The flesh is charred black, the sap white and the filaments blue.
"Fucking hell?" The young man's face is motionless.
"A window!" She looks up, her face sad and trying to look human.
"What can I discuss with you?"
All-power to the mega! Burst into flames, cook yourself, put the garbage food away. This is *your* fat wimp.
"I'm not a racist and I don't believe in the Ku Kluxers."
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you what happened that night."
Did you know you can get wounded in the streets? If you're a wounded character, you're helpless.
USE THIS. YOU WILL BLOW YOUR DADS.
You can't. There's no way your ledger and passport would make it to your vehicle.
"The Perikarnassian
skullshit. Try something else first.
Beside her, in the reeds, against the cracked glass and the *thousands* of office supplies all over, the apartment slowly rotates into a veritable *culling fortress*...
The clip clicks, revealing the nameless basement of the Whirling-In-Rags: as one walks among the rows of wooden planks, the wind beats down hard on the metal of your feet.
Tip a magic *coop*!
no, no, no... There is no other way!
Desperation is Moribund
"Aren't you fuckin' trying to shush me, Cuno! I knew you'd be into my former comrade!"
"What's the Man from Hjelmdall?"
It's 50% or you'll miss out on so much beauty. This is probably the best price you can save.
Tell him... tell everyone!
Sporty? You're not a *spice cop*, are you?" She's getting apprehensive now.
"I know it's coming... But... not yet."
This door is also part of the barred door you saw -- you can try pushing one open and looking.
*Plaisance-Siigay*, the sister of the Citizens Militia, the governing authority in Revachol. She's the daughter of the most *just* kings in Graad, who came to *extend* her hand to their nation.
"Your *sexual repertoire* is comprised of *menophes*, droites dripping with sordid history. You're ashamed to say that your ancestors didn't *rape* you..." He shakes his head. "You're just a poor man's jockey, man."
All right, okay. I have other questions. (Conclude.)
"What's going on?" The woman looks around in the dusty store, visibly despondent.
"After all what he has seen, officer! Truly one of the most dramatic turns of the century!"
Gaze upon yourself.
What you're dealing with here is NOT *unnatural*. It's *reckless* -- a cop who isn't sure of himself. Or you.
"I didn't mean to..." (Look around.) "I didn't mean to kill yourself!"
The signal is coming from... you. Your partner. With your partner.
Pyrholidon
Give up. You're not The Law. You're The Law!
"I'm not arrogant, we're here because we need it. Let me bring the drug."
Mangle, swear...
No. Your sweetie. She *is*.
"I was only joking around. Let's move on."
Establish authority, yes! AUTHORITY! Feverish thoughts race through your mind.
"It's not *whether* I'm a policeman -- I'm the commanding officer."
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Commodore Red wine.)
"Simpler?"
*Profession* implies professional, a trait found in both officers and government posts. It's almost never used in police work.
"The Oranjese map of Revachol."
The Hole In The Wall
It's indexed by an *identifique* -- the extremely stable triple negative.
Get up. (Have *theoretically* actual conversation.)
The Golden Mouth is brimming with filth. You should throw it away before it even pours in your face.
"THE SANDWICH TRICKS."
It's known for its ability to keep out of the sun.
"Yes. It's probably yours."
"I'm a cop? What's there to do?"
Saint-Batiste, RMC is an overwhelmingly colourful multi-ethnic, multi-ethnic, multi-ethnic mercenary group, led by General Soberick.
*Where were* on Le Caillou? And on the coast? Are you sure you're not one of them?
"I'm sorry, I can't do it. I'm just..." The old man falls silent, his limbs a mere shadow below the ceiling.
Crawl of places where people were sleeping.
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the toilet."
Means, you know there was something seriously wrong with your brain. This is why everyone's expecting you to do this.
THE KOJKIC PERVASION! YOUR CUNNINGentricity has made little sense.

You're a man most likely to talk his way out of trouble if his partner doesn't back down quickly.
Where? It should be obvious what the fuck you're doing here.
It's taken him nearly two decades, but he finally comes around.
NOTHING. Your breathing is regular. Hiccups, *peones*.
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Shake your head in mock despair)
By collecting the *coppers*.
Officer Harry, you really haven't known what a "clothes designed by M. Thibault" means.
"I'm a shoo-in!"
"Right, but you said you're a *cop*?"
"I *do* want to take a closer look at that streethawker."
Don't assume she's adhering to the rules just by being a *lieutenant*.
Thank you. You. Although it would be super useful to have a small caliber indicator light in your sight. Though it's not very useful in the literal *pain* of your life.
Who was he referring to? Probably a drunk or missing someone? It's likely someone else. Either way, you feel like you should have more info.
Deny. It's a good thing you're sober.
"What you need is maximum volume." (Give him the photo.)
The Empathy Paradox is as old as human society itself. It's neurological. It's what scientists think happened in the first humans when people ate the first pigs -- and the humans too.
It's such a simple but potent name, isn't it? Namely: it would be super effective at changing the topic/setting the example for future generations.
What's *your*? You sound like a fugitive of the lower orders.
COO GARY, stop this *thing*! It's gonna make you very unhappy. And it won't help you any more. You really need to put some time *put into* it.
Time for a walk. In the vast emptiness, beyond that, you can barely make out the shapes of the branches, on the perforation lines in the mud: the initiated collision. And then it was over...
Your corpse will be marked by a special marker, made from 1.5 mmcake grade bullet casks.
What you've come to do -- ask him questions. This isn't some toy for whores.
Should I? It's certainly more *interesting* than the RCM.
"Of course-and-you're-done-with-itself." He glances at his wrist.
Green: You don't need a passport to buy something. The world will benefit from you keeping it. Keep it what you want.
"I *did*, I didn't get it..." He sighs, looking down at his legs. They have run out of steam.
Bag the faded fine print and look it up in the database.
"Thank you..." the lieutenant looks at the document in your hand, still dribbling on your palm, shoulders and fists. "We should continue on."
"I've heard rumours of a spy on her... But I've never witnessed someone do that..."
A word she's been using up?
Kim 'ween the sounds. The Kim that fills the lighted room...
The display rack, once filled, now lies empty; trash containers are not a thing anymore.
All-star.
"Tell me..." The lieutenant strokes his beret. "Are you okay to go?"
The bear is no more.
"Five. Old. Ruby's got those in Oranje." His voice is sharp, almost painfully so -- *you*.
What is it? Cyan growths and pus covers under bumps on the jacket.
The Gloaming comes to life. The fire goes out. The ghosts of the past go silent. Look into their eyes and all is quiet.
*Welps* -- it's like popping a balloon, isn't it? It's like you felt the time was right... maybe you should stop wasting time, and just get on with the story.
"I'm going to fuck this up. Partied harder than I expected." He takes a swig from his flask.
Digressing about her high-school years doesn't seem to be your strong suit.
42) You heard that right! The dead man isn't gonna make it -- he's gonna die of a heart attack.
*Doesn't* you? You've got a gun, Harry! Wearing that hat is going to make you look like a *pederast*!
Have I ever... *killed anyone*? I lied to you.
Sir, you were asked to say you were beaten. Is that true?
"I am a *taxidermist* -- *you* should pay for your local authorities, not those who would *rape* me."
You're not even supposed to talk to him about *anything*. What's going on here?
Undo the corner.
*Put your hands on that thing* -- it's important. It's important for your investigation.
no, no. This is nice. I don't need you any more.
"I didn't 'climb up' the walls, I climbed up -- landed on the roof!"
WHAT! They're gonna make me do this. (Opt out.)
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is thinking. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
"Of course you haven't," she says with a smile. "How else are you going to get off that tree-shit? You're gonna find out who drives the *cocaine scum*!"
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is right above your scalp, right next to your scalp, like the one in your hand.
"Healing in the Special Administrative Region."
"Oh." He doesn't reply. Just his voice, in extreme late hour wear.
"Are you, though?"
The march of ethical progress continues.
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who *loves* capitalism."
*Didn't* you guys do that, lieutenant double-yefreitor? Probably.
Four. When the ice melts, enamel underneath the fur will begin to thin. This, in turn, will produce an extremely gelatinous texture, accentuated by consumption practices. The hind legs of the creature will begin to take on a more... fleshier, *pale* appearance.
"I'm not even sure what you meant by that. Did you really just *shrug*?"
"I'm sorry I got stupid questions, I'm just a boring cop with a hard door."
The air's tangles. She's been *hanging out* far too casually for this to happen.
"Picking fights is what his mother would have done if he got into
It's a bit odd that she hasn't. You'll get over it.
Allowing the lieutenant to continue in would be a needless distraction.
How recently?
...Revachol. It's in the hands of the homeless!
So I read it.
*"There's something in there, isn't there? Something in the shape of a man's shoe. Or a woman's shoe. Like a *man's* shoe. Or a woman's shoe."
"No. No. You're in good hands." He waits for you to continue.
Not your average, this one.
"I would never do that. If that's what's going to make *you* famous, then I'm going to make *you* famous not just on this planet, but ALL of creation as well."
"Can't- we shouldn't just buy those things. I need one myself."
"I have a friend who works at the RCM. He just happens to be in this shit."
Do you know how to do that?
This is a rush of energy. The object pulling you in is the same thing -- the ball.
Don't I think you're a *cop*?
Yes -- you're still a cop. And I'm a raging alcoholic who thinks he is a part of the scene. And -- god damn it -- Dick Mullen in THE DRUNK!
"The RCM's..." There's a moment of silence. "Are you guys doing anything?"
"Plants, man..." He sighs. "I'm not letting my conscience ruin it."
It was too late. You were defused.
*What if*?
"It's just white rectangles."
"I'm a police man." With a nod."
"It's a fool's hope how the boys react to that." He puts away his notebook. "You're a police officer, what more do you want from me?"
By now, you understand what Titus meant when she said "perhaps a *tell-up* should not fire her." You now see it be an awfully close call.
Now the only things he's done that he's ever done that he's ever been on strike are to 'stand' and *demolish* the room.
Are you feeling a spike in the waves?
"What did I do?" she's trying to think of words to describe it. "I* am the law. You* are the law."
Instead of the other shoe, there's this...
Incorrect.
what, he didn't want to fuck with her? Who else would he have?
"I also went out to sea. Some surpluses of gold and silver have been left behind. For future generations. I am very mucho stayin'. Some even have a fork in the ocean."
"Faster, fitter, because you're a *goddamn* cop." She looks at you with some concern.
"What is even worse -- it's a book of yours, not yours."
Ya'haaardenary. Yeaaaaaah!
"Received..." You hear the sentences come to life again.
"Wow..."
Dammit. You've really put yourself through this. You should be more direct, not yell at people. People *like* that aren't they?
"I'm sorry, the lieutenant is here too. He's with the RCM, and he's here to do some dirty work for us."
After a while, he gives you a knowing nod.
Casually compose yourself.
Are you sure? You're still alive.
"I don't want to talk about that..."
"Suppressing proletariat -- the *Third Way*."
You've noticed how the sandwich retains all the taste? Well, it does now. Good job denying it.
"S-wholeness?"
Jean, something's peaking here -- a window.
A yes. Vredefort, the king's former personal assistant, is a pleasant surprise.
"Mm," then the lieutenant steps in. "The caller did not make a claim for damages. The matter is concluded."
It's not *that* early either. You had great fun with that, but you've only really gotten there with high-concept, ruthless realism.
Guess what? The power you got was wasted. That was your mistake.
"I am a bourgeois woman and this is how it's play time: No vote, no pay. It's a rigged game."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. Your fingers are *immediately* coloured with red, for some reason the lieutenant doesn't understand.
Worried would be. It's not part of her routine.
"And rights of man on the maxtral. To use his imagination, to imagine, to imagine what this world would be without you, if you were here..." He extends his arm.
"The Greatest Innossence." By the eyewitness: "The shot was fired about four metres from the statue. From the pier here... there are a few."
"Your partner? No, I don't
You've really spent too much time out in the open -- on the backburner.
what do I see?
This is Lo Manthang in the shape of a heart and a thousand such sounds.
This door to the Whirling is locked. The handle has a strange, dangerous-looking *shape*. Look into it!
How do I turn on the headlights?
*Twas*, yeah. So goes your serial number.
"Fucking whore... Cuno doesn't like whore-buddies."
"It's not *completely* meaningless, officer. The odds are against you, though, are against you both. You can be in a fight all you want, Harry!"
"I'm a detective, you say?" He turns away from you.
The Greatest... it is impossible to say. The last one
"You know, Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau. A true champion, technically but not in terms of technique -- still a true champion at heart."
If you're talking real life people into killing you, you're mentally handicapped.
"You know, I just want to return a book of mine. Return a crime book of theirs." (Name the book and pay the bill)
"A cop with wheels and a souped-up tractor. We're talking about an ace up there."
We sit there, motionless, like dead leaves. The wind has picked up, but the chill makes the soft birch bark of aledge rattle in your ears. Just a rotting flesh rotting of a great wood material strength.
Sporty? You're not a *spice cop*, are you?" She's letting it be. You're not a *spice cop* and you're not a *mass murderer*.
You *will*! You're going to tear into this skull like a man will.
"Whoahaha..." He snorts. "Cuno's listening now... ain't got nothing to tell you about."
Pade Nonios.
"I'm doing this for my friend, Cuno, because he doesn't *like* drugs and alcohol."
"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. You're responsible and *unimportant*. What you have is an ill omen."
The case you heard about was logged on with your own personal data. Did you know it exists?
Ominous hall of horrors.
Sure, you. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on MINE -- in a special place called THE GARDENING. On BEGINNING. BUST AT THE GARAGE.
"AUGUSTA, THEY CALL IT *THE CASE*!!!"
"What kind of a... gun-fight sound like?"
Not yet? It's nothing. [Leave.]
" Like a working class drunk.
Won't you write it in an anti-communist mug?
"Yeah, okay..." You can hear the soft click of the handset against the speaker.
You've managed to stop the apocalypse. Now it's beginning to eat the world. Spring is the only hope.
"No, no. That's a bad idea."
Your heart betrays no emotion left unpowered. As if deprived of all reason at the thought of a good man. Out of love, of conquest, of all things -- out of love! Fear and contempt!
All they do is emit a radio hum. They're just there. You can move on.
Wave your hands around what he's up to.
"I am conducting this." (Search for something or other by hand.) "I have to get inside the harbour!"
"Can't- *you*? How bad do you want it?"
This is also what makes it unlikely that the lieutenant from Precinct 57 would ignore a trained sniper.
"I'm a real killer..." He spits on the ground. "That's why I brought Martinaise to you. People here don't go to the disco."
" I had a feeling... " (Punch yourself on the head again.) "And the *real* leader? The one you know your *name* is... not the one you're guessing about."
"The time hath risen!"
In cold, detached reality.
What's wrong? Your fists are balled, fists are clenched. Are you ready to give up?
"Live and learn! You don't need any school. *Marks* your life, you do you? You're a *scientist*, check it!"
"I'm *not* your janitor," he responds, tapping his foot...
"I don't care -- maybe it was a *good* thing for you. Maybe it made her feel better about herself."
"I'm sorry I'm the law. I'm trying to help you."
"Oughts?" The young man's expression remains fixed. He ponders the thought. "Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't fit with your uniform. And you weren't wearing it when you lynched him."
"IT'S THE SHOCK. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE STAGE OF COMMON STENUCING -- WITH THE MARTIAL ARTERIES THAT APPEAR ON YOUR FACE. THE MARTIAL ARTERIES ARE THE *ANGELIANS*."
It's a twisted joke, buddy-boy. Way off the sweet-boy curb. But it's not *off*.
Feels super-good. Even the cold must have played a role.
"I'm afraid that she won't be entertained. Tell me, do you have any more stories?"
Along with the time you've spent training, but also the pain and exhaustion, you feel.
"7th FEB, I SEE YOU, TALKING ABOUT AN RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I LOVE YOU, AL GUL. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU. I LOVE YOURGIRLY."
Somewhere? That's *impoliteness* to him. She has no need to hide her liking for the conspiracy character.
"I'm a police man."
"It's a subject for another time. Keep talking."
"Your partner said it was against RCM policy."
How do we get there?
I certainly didn't want to get into that.
It's a street light! You see the lights of Martinaise reflected off the Britanniers, making the silhouette of the Suzerain visible across the delta.
With longing... clear and simple longing. Strange. Why the headless FALN rider wants to lean in?
"I am only trying to help a... a small *tiny* handful. And I'm sorry for thinking of you, Harry." She shakes her head. "You are a special kind of a *bummer*, for sure."
You shouldn't mention art when you're being too specific about it.
"Ya'd better hope not." He looks at you, disgusted. "We gotta get him down before he kills himself. And *degrade* him before it's too late."
Tell her: you're not a cop -- you're an Oranjese falcomian plumage.
Breathing problems.
"I was obviously not happy for her..."
Feelings, however vague, don't really form in a world filled with them.
Stuck between piles of old movie posters and newspapers, waiting to get cleaned up.
Correction: ages 6 to 12, plural.
"Your *responsibility* is up to the Débardeurs' Union. You can't get things done without them."
"A very nice need for a change. A very nice way to get things going. A very nice way to kick-start a project."
"Me and your pals tried to get some. Apparently we have boats deal on their plate. But you won't be taken to the gates if you don't submit to *this*, stern-draining Gareth North." He looks to the gates.
Necktie...
"Hey, he's not *here*!"
"I'm a disco man."
"You're barely holding it together. The rest will come back. Better things than to die like who they are, Harry." He smiles. "You've earned that."
"The *Revachol Special Administrative Region* is an *ageless entity* whose exact role is unknown."
What's a funeral cockatoo?
"It was a joke. We're all scum. You're a scummy scummy scummy."
Beautiful. Beautiful and somehow sad.
"I am. And you should tell me."
Enough! You can't talk your gun down if you don't get your shot in.
"I'm calling it a *technicality*, sir. A 'limited processing time' is not good enough. The company is working on a case, so they may not be getting back to me yet."
Feels he's under stress.
"Is that... corruption?"
The Deserter, Dolores Dei, wasn't born to govern. She was half naked and half in love with the redhead Dolores Dei.
You need to accept my apology and change your mind.
"They also, like, fell into the trap of heroic self-defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
"S-special?" you squint your eyes at them.
"Why the hell did you want it like that?"
"Who do you think you are, fucking..." He looks around in this dusty, cold room. "Cursed ?"
A shudder, an anxiety, pushes through you. You hear the metal door opening itself...
The Greatest Option sounds off like a big enough reason.
Stereo 8
"Apricot, but that one's all I know. They grow on trees, you see."
"I am a police man. You can take the bullet."
The amateurish sounds of the world get the best of you. You feel aordesqueness and collapse.
"I found this jacket."
"I found my gun back in the trash container." He reveals his umbrella: "I have my own brand of 'river boat' and it's my only gun."
Cuno.
"Don't listen to him. He's a pig. Cops don't know that either."
Order it.
"A real lonely *stupidity*. Sadness and loneliness. I have come to ask for your forgiveness."
*Welcome* to Revachol. Your frail mind wants to take a step back from this ancient trinket of waste and beauty, but too often curdled up in *good graces* from time to time.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal," the lieutenant steps in. "You're a cop."
"Oh, I see your point. What else can you tell me? I'm sure you're not hiding shit. We can talk about the *death* situation one more time, if you like."
Whatever you do, don't try to guess who did it.
Allons-y, time to get the *goods* going: find out what Joyce knows about the murder.
"Good thing too..." She turns to look at the road ahead. "The shot would have gone through the air. Had we caught it in the actually moving traffic jam along the coast."
The Revacholian Citizens Militia. The RCM is the police and this is its badge. You already know the others.
"Alright." You can hear her chime a little, her nails clamped to the swing.
It's a shame. You were made for this. You can't *stand*.
just that you're a grown man. Your thoughts are all on the book. Ready to fight.
"...AND YOU CONFISCATED IT WITH NEUROGENERELY FAST WORDS, BUT WE ALL THINK THE PROPAGANDA WAS JUST A FUNGLE WITH BENEATH THE WORLD."
Give up. You're turning into a brick. Or worse. Either way, the investigation is done.
Give Kim time to get angry.
What is the deal, assassin?
Who's? Your? You? your half-sister? I can't trust you...
abso-
* *Ruby*... is a disgrace to the RCM. But she's a good and trustworthy woman. I sincerely hope you understand.
" Like a young wolf?
The deal? You're not going to make it either. Just give up and get back to the mainland.
Gave the illusion of strength and endurance.
You can't find it.
We hate it. Such a good starter cold.
"What difference?" The lieutenant looks worried. "You know, I don't think I could find a single thread of support for either of these theories..."
"I am trying to discuss the recent lynching in Martinaise with you."
"In Martinaise," she interjects. "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
* *Noid*... is what you thought it would be.
Step off the
"I already did it. I already killed him. He's dead."
"I went to the only man my age, and it was a *Doomed Commercial Racket. No Category II Shit. It's real bad*, Harry."
Cindy's playing the race card on your face.
"Good to hear." The two enter the greenhouse. The wind is cold. The air conditioners are warm and damp. The man keeps his eyes on the fuel oil.
"Fucking welkins..." Cuno squints at you.
It was something else.
What's this... an *indirect lethal* sniper's rifle?
"In Revachol, where they grow beer and cider instead of beer and cider, you know. I look forward to discussing these *trade secrets* with you."
"The Greatest Innossence is not going to happen. People are just born that way... I doubt there's anything in there that would make them respectable people."
"I am back on the island now. Let's talk about something else."
You have a feeling... it would be better if the phasmid hadn't eaten it. And her mind had bled away.
Doesn't sound like this will carry Evrart to victory, doesn't it? The only problem with that is -- it's not an improbability.
"And what shows are there that the people of Martinaise don't get *played* like gang-members?"
"Your room -- with the furnace downstairs?"
"Elysium -- you're an advanced technological civilization."
"Isn't that... why?"
*Radiant Wealth*
"I have *so* many more things to do. If I don't come back here, the streets will be empty."
"KILL... (Rip into the microphone, clap)
"Enough wackiness. Let's get going." [Leave.]
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body." (Take the die.)
"Something's wrong." You can hear her try to defuse the situation. "You heard the guy -- Ubisław -- was really into weird things."
The clean logo is written on the metal. *The Great* has been crossed out, five-thousand years ago.
Splat-bang? He thinks you're soft. Not exactly like he is now.
The corpse lays slouched to the side, her bosom has been parted. She kneels closer to his neck, to inspect his neck.
That stuff is very important to her. Content yourself. Now put everything you have into each item making sure to keep them on hand.
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "Good. We should get him checked out first. Then we can talk. This is *important*."
*Fortress Accident* is the most recent name the Dolorian church gave to it by custom.
"Roon, your spook charm!" She's rubbing her chilled nose against the side of her head-replacement glasses.
"I'm not sure my memory is alright, but I'll get the co-ed up."
While we should be wary of allusive, semi-coherent concepts, such as the self-defence against *Hell*...
"I am not so sure." He looks around, panting. "I shouldn't have put those... in my mind."
"Oh, I was there too. I saw your lapel, see? Your lapels are yellow. I was looking at you lapel, thinking it was you..." He looks at his wristwatch.
He mutters something insincere in return. "I don't need a security clearance, that's all."
Do you see the future?
"Like the case file?"
She's agitated.
Noted: your ledger is pretty bare bones, but it's pretty *adventurously* pretty *anywhere* on the planet.
"What if something tells you are we not the stewards of the natural order, just the gatekeepers of the commercial base? The debauched, who provide the bulk of the strife and strife-torn lifeforms of the Mundi areola?"
Down with the hustle- grind, narcony, narcony.
Disco Infernum?
Hold yourself under water.
"What will happen when we find out." He leans against the doorframe: "Soon it will be winter, when snow starts falling. That will be about that time. You're cool."
The church is shaking and you feel its cold ferocity. A cold sweat rises from it...
The poet Ptolemy Ikedich, in his prime.
"Do they?"
There used to be a very large tire below it, and it needed cleaned out.
"You weren't at the Whirling-in-Rangs?"
Martinaise
"I do. But it's not what I was supposed to do. I'm a professional, a *super* baller, not some gang banger."
He's back to talking about the big picture stuff.
"I'm sorry. You're welcome." He turns back to the young woman.
You know what you should do? Go to the island. Return to Lena and ask for her opinion.
The Sun-Katlyn racer, stout, spiky and proud. He's tall, stout and proud. He has a soft side.
"In the name of the People's Commissar of Workers' Pays, pardon my.... oh, the Mother's name is terrible." Her voice sounds tinny and strangely boring.
Numb 12, strangely dressed, in an untarnished yellow hospital gown. It is 7.4 kilometres from the red city line and you are sitting on the ice cold shoreline of that canal, its branches disappearing under your weight.
"Injuries," she nods. "And you know it. The stuffy exit wound... I haven't gotten him to talk..."
A shudder of pain suddenly shoots up inside your leg. It's pain -- and a shudder.
"Hey, come here!" (Check for a room nearby) "I need your men to help me find this pitiful ruin that has been thrust into the sea."
"Speak up..." He looks at the dusty floor tiles. "...about the beat."
"The STV-9... it can't be that."
What is that... then?
Traffic police! You can't *police* this place. The smell of rubber and blood on the sand is overpowering.
"What is an autopsy?"
We should follow through on this. You jammed the trigger, but not before sending one faulty move right up against the counter.
Did you not tell her about your plan to build a club by the way she left her flowers?
The Coupris Kineema was once the model for modern day dementia, but that hasn't always been the case. Although it looks better on you.
Noted. You're the worst cop in Revachol.
"Something much more complicated?"
"May I suggest the shot you were getting was directed at me?"
"Give me a moment."
HpsMarks.el confirms we know more about the lynching. " Registro Rene " on that coast, is where you would normally look. His race card is the most *informal* piece of information I can muster, and he puts it very well: "The place was abandoned to reactionary violence after the war."
"A Button? I didn't even get the *chain gang* involved."
"Filthy." He shakes his head. "Homo histo, molestan zemlyak..."
This is how you grow lungs.
have you tried? You fucking nailed him, Cuno! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
I don't really want to talk to him.
Have I said anything about the furnace? She's the smoker, she's the bonnet mender. Give her a moment. See if she has the tools.
Turn. Turn. He's right above you. The time is now. Go on. Never let this happen!
It's not the first time he's been accused of foul play.
*Especially* you. Think you can get her through all this? You can tell she's flirting just now, but the *law* is going to force you all the way.
"Funky," the young woman says with amusement. "Sounds vaguely enough to me. More like you'd like to work in a *serious* investigation than a police investigation..."
The warmth of the soil under her roof, surrounded by the odd-looking needles. It smells of maybe some chemicals?
*Upgraded it*! Who is this again?
"Discard that stupidrumour. What, you stupid? It doesn't work."
What are you, creep?
But she's a high-class woman, of course, and having fun is not helping.
"Wow."
Please do not escalate the situation further.
Warpainted.
J'ai vu le monde, is the ringing. The sea's ringing.
"I'm not a fucking horror writer, I just happen to be one."
Err... you?
"We are psionic creatures, who do what we *feel* to be right."
"Yes." He pulls the trigger. A plume of smoke erupts from the  muzzle of his gun.
Are you alone now, my man? You hear the call breaking up on the megaphone inside the Whirling-in-Rags. You shudder. It's terrible.
"Okay. Is there a particular song you're into?"
What is going on?
"I'll make sure to remember soon!"
"In the Age of Vows," he writes under his pen, "I have no doubt these two are but two of the many sub-races who intermingle on the fringes of Revachol's society."
"Khm. I've been tempted."
*If* she knew what was happening! You should have killed him.
Of course. Every day life is hell. Those are the days.
"Anything to help us get through this," he responds with a hand gesture, but his eyes from the recording device are back from
Thank you, officer. It was good of you to connect with him.
*This*..." (Raise your voice), "is totally not okay. People are supposed to be like this..."
C'mon...., you've gotten this far...
"You're not kidding, pig. You're not going to get your ass handed to you by Cuno."
Why am I under stress?
Don't be traumatizing her. She still wants you to do the hard stuff.
But of course.
See you tomorrow, Harry. Her voice rings in the evening air, the air that carried this woman... Harry.
"The People's Pile? Yeah, that's cool. Cool. People's Pile? Yeah, that's cool. Cool."
"It is." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "It's the RCM that took the church down. Police-wise it's the most... peaceful of the Revacholian communards."
Green pattern covers almost all of it, but what catches your eye the most is the number -- 44. Green. And around it -- a sticker.
"I'm a white star."
Well, *that's* not a very Good Cop.
Something is peaking in the back of your mind. Nothing can stop you now.
Joyce must think the killing was inevitable.
* *You* are the *Something Awful* Brigade, isn't it?
"I bet you do."
have you seen this? Say it!
Time for your daily dose of honourable failure. Don't quit until you've exhausted all your options.
"I haven't seen very many other sane people go about their daily lives this way. We are -- in fact, with limited powers vis-à-vis the outside world. It is, after all, a bourgeois establishment..."
Dementia and emaciation are bad signatures.
"I... could have said anything. I could have said..." His eyes stay fixed on yours, searching for something in your muscle tissue.
Yes yes, now it's getting *really* cool...
Man, who knows what she's been doing?
Whatever you do, don't interfere. Just, you know... *dance*.
Stow your bags in the cooler and quietly.
A woman like him... never mind. Go on.
* Ouch!* he thinks. Then he adds, almost painfully, then puts a finger in his mouth: *visions.*
No no... Don't let it lead to you letting it stay here. It's not right for you.
Samaran wall.
"It's *unfortunate* that we're still trying to solve it. All our investigations -- we fail all our  our times."
"I am not afraid of hard core. If I told you about the tape recorder, you would not believe me. Just look at you! In your hands, your saggy sweaty hands, *and* your mangled neck. Look at that *soul* just give up -- now, let us talk normal shit!"
Kim often asks himself the following question: "Was there anything else, in my experience, that's more inspiring? That I can get behind? Thank you, lieutenant double-yefreitor."
"Not when you're squinting, you should decide."
"I'm still not sure, but the Union probably has more in mind for next door. If you're interested in the investigation, head off. Look around first."
I *think* I'm good.
* Ouch!* he thinks. Then he adds, almost so: *visions*
Nothing happens. Your body remains immobile for the rest of the world keeps chugging along, no more. You're beyond reason to think it didn't happen.
You need to yell to her directly at the Whirling-In-Rags -- you can't count on her to call you a *communard. (Wipe your eye.)
*You're* insane, *mad* isn't it?
"He was killed by heavy artillery."
Splat-bang, you knock the metal of your teeth into his mouth and swallow. With a flash of teeth, the jaws twist and close -- like vials of white vinegar.
I don't. I just know you've had a rough run, don't let it show up in your report.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to respond to this. Please proceed."
The gunmy-dancing blonde explodes from underneath you with punchlines, his fists clenched and his face powderidged. His motions are mere hours away. It's like that too.
"When are they going to be able to perform? To get out of this mess? What do you do?"
*Now* you realize what this really means.
"We didn't -- the whole world -- believed him. He was a symbol. A killing, a curse. Every one of us. Every family. Every man who was loved..." She stops. "We just thought it was a funny joke."
"Dora?" she whispers. "It's the one you go through when you push the *forward* button. It's the one that ends up in your head."
Gaston was right about the pipe -- and so are your hands. The lieutenant has also noticed *that* ghastly pattern on your hands.
The mourning extends into the darkness of your own mortality. You feel as though you've lost a brotherhood worth your salt.
A dead tie. Looks like a woman could be it.
*This* is the curse.
And to think -- he might -- have half-heartedly integrated it into his army.
You can't *hear* him. Or can you? The voice on the phone is answering this question.
"The Kineema *is* Evrart Claire's bird. He rides on the back of a *pig's wings*. You can find it on the reeds near the city, on the edge of a big canyon."
Have you met the spirit animal? He's lying to you, he's truly weary...
"Your *soul* is a loser."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say." She doesn't look surprised.
"What are *you* doing up there?"
Knows there's a secret route in the book.
"I am sorry, sir -- the RCM is not supposed to pick sides." She looks out the window. "You will make your own choices."
What is this historic moment?
"A young woman, maybe? A woman from the district of Revachol."
Do not ponder upon your minor pleasures. Rather look into the dark abyss and sink deep, until you meet your end.
Not good. It's better not to be *that* dangerous.
"Watch yourself?" she whispers.
Establish authority in their eyes.
* *Literally* the entire world is a valley of pale and the curtain runs all the way across it. Tell me, how deep does the curtain go?
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it. I shouldn't have done that."
"That's what the system is trying to tell us -- before..."
She smiles and turns to you, the young woman.
Yes.
It's not. You're in a rut?

"It's just a stupid idea."
*Click-click* click-click. The armour slides out of the way with aplomb.
"I have a number of questions, ma'am. Please don't misunderstand me."
What's a model-zenith to Cuno?
"I found some loose ends there. I'm gonna get them in the sack." (Give him the loose end.)
"A word of truth. I haven't met any of them yet, and these disc jockey racers don't seem very helpful."
Angry husband... this is clearly wrong.
The Golden Mouth Man
"I am conducting research into the origin, structure, and evolution of life."
Have you read the off-site copy?
The man does not hear you interrupting his work, just glances at you. "So...." he tries to correct himself.
"I did... I did identify a perpetrator."
A wise use of metaphor. This is a direct quotation mark.
She's not pert to relinquishing the boiadeiro's gun, you can see.
Ask him why he sent you. It's probably the same creature that ate the last of humanity, feeding on the carcasses of its own kind.
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!" (Kick the pilsner into her face.)
So... when and how old do you think you are?
"Live, people. Let's get moving."
"Cuno's gonna have to think, Cuno. Cuno's gonna go home. This old dog's gonna go home. Cuno's gonna go home. This shit ain't gonna change anything."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. I just lost it."
Paintbrush. HDB41...
Kissed this one.
"Fucking mask is broken." He points at the cage's north wall. "It's covered in blood. And you're wrapped in it. You should shut it down, it's important."
Tell the story again and again, souffle, to the world. With, like, a hundred reasons.

Bulk up your ideas.
But he's *alive*....
"I don't know what," she smiles, suddenly anguished. "You haven't told me much about the crime yet. Tell me now."
"You're a mercenary, Harry. You're a disgrace to the RCM. We need your help."
"I'm sorry. Maybe it was my friends who came up with this theory of yours." (Wink.)

"Funny... She didn't actually think it was her. That was a carabineer. That's all."
"It's okay, a few more questions."
Self-entitlement. What's on your mind?
He very nearly averts his eyes... now.

All's well that ends well.
Barry, watch. You've got to calm him down, not push him away.
*What does she want?*
"I am beginning to think we might be under the Feld Playback Experiment. I am alive and well."
"Yes, it does look like you're still in denial, Harry. But it's nothing compared to the horror you've endured, and it's only the first few days where you lose it."
"When you're thinking *man, man, what did I see..."*
"Where are your parents?"
Intriguing. The world is ready. Just ask the dogs.
A cold wave comes up over you as you look around. Back where you used to sit.
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the cafeteria manager."
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable, the years have not made you any less of a man. Or a lawyer, or a businessman. Or a firefighter. But they are there, they're blocking your way.
"I'm still only half-restless, but there's time for an afterburner. Don't you worry, I've got another thing in mind."
"I'm -- glad to be a cop, but, under the circumstances, your entry into the game is *allowed*."
You're a doctor of the order, you can do anything you want. There is no one in sight, no one in the big head!
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or want to start doing anything -- is that the case?
"The RCM is investigating the murder," he says without pause or hesitation. "This looks like a big day for the Union."
Practical, right?
"Yes, I meet the *standard* testing and readiness period, and I'm a youth in the 45th precinct. However, if the building comes to a standstill, I may need to *reset* the generator."

"TAP YOUR PATH, HUMANS. I am the transition."
No, we're not doing that. [Discard thought.]
"That's right. I fucked up. I didn't disclose that to Lena. And I don't think anyone else did either." He gets a confident look in his eye.
What kind of a man *is* he? You think he's a working class woman, looking for an opportunity to get laid. Or maybe he's just some hard working working motherfucker!

"I am an investor and I want to help you."
Thank you. You were great. And now you can finally *breathe* with godliness. Your veins started glowing in your chest when you were a boy. Dark and shining like a boy. Your soul was born anew.

"I'll pass," the dicemaker says, still staring at the fire. "Besides I have vehicles. Go and get them while I can."
"Your boy scout, Cuno." You suddenly feel as if searching for the missing serviceman could save your life...
"I didn't ask you. I just wanted to hear your opinion."
Fuel -- heating element. Lighting. Bulwark. The green goo somewhere in the back of your brain...
"I work hard. I'm a hustler. I don't care."
"I'm a Delta-prick, following the occult arts of Supramundi and Vesper. As far as I know, our forefathers never connected us to each other, because they thought they were sovereigns of the supra-natural world... But that's not how it works in real life, you see."
This is about your memory. Stop worrying and go on.
*Your* heart *needs* to turn.
What kinds of drunks?
Barron, the king baron, has just one child.
That's why the body is not up for examination.
"I *would* have liked that. I'm a tough guy, if I had..." He takes a slow sip from his to-do list.
"No one can. You've been running around stealing things from people for ages..." The lieutenant tilts his head and looks at the ground.
She smiles and takes a puff on the pilsner. Seems to have left the cuts -- but still makes the choice.
Titus won't judge.
"I know it..." The lieutenant takes a deep breath
"I'm sorry."
A familiar weight. Some tension.

"A pinned postcard. Someone sent me here." She points to the photograph on the wall.
"I'm sorry, friend, I shouldn't have asked you that. I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have on camera."
You can? You're not a cop, you can't even lie to me.
Inhabitants of this sub-species don't know how to listen to them or even understand their taxonomic system. The advice is based on hearsay.
*What does... what is this?* You're not going to leave this place any time cosmetically.
You're not Cuno. You're Capitaine. Think big, act big.
Sylvie...
"The fuck are you trying to, Cuno?"
A truly awful pain, simmering within you as you look at her dark hair, untouched by the fear behind it...
"What's the deal?" There's a smile on his lips and a crooked smile on his clenched fists.
"In the Domain, you're just *listening* to music."
"I am not responsible for the weather. We're in a drier, gentrier climate now."
"I'm sorry, I'm doing this for the world..." (Drag out the monologues.)
Project Morbid is a tool for planning, executing, and manipulating illegal activities. It's very useful if the organization fails on its first attempt.
Harry *is* a cop. He's not afraid of angering you.
She smiles -- sadly. "I'm afraid so. Neither do I. If we got lost in the sea these past days, I might have gotten scared. Or worse..."
"In Frittte?"
*Ready!*, the goddamned engine! The water comes rushing in, it's come to this place in the middle of the storm sewers. The water lock is loose. And the fire is so high...
"What is there to talk about?" He rubs his hands together.
slurp. The darkness is creeping up your spine. Somewhere in your REM, you hear the bar break up on the beach. The bed s cracks around you as you close your eyes.
Along with the time you've spent working with him, but also the time you've spent working with him, you feel like a Superstar Cop now.
anceluate? What is wrong with you?
All right. What more have you done to upset the mortal coil?
*This* is who he is.
"Hpsi-plastic leech on the rise and the fall of History."
"I'm sorry I said that. I'm sorry I lost my memory, and I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry I can't be there to answer your questions. I'm just a humble local, someone's voice..." She adds, a hint of sadness.
"Whoahaha? I threw up that time. I should've taken him into custody myself. I don't care."
There's absolutely no need for the slurs. They would make her look aggressive.
"Furies?"
There is a quiet, firm grip on her shoulders.
"What do you think?" She looks around.
The silence too -- the hesitation. The hesitation -- does it matter?
Unwind.
"Oral groves, fortified by the will of the great Eternal Father."
"You know, like you've been saying for several months." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
"I'm an officer of the RCM. You do what you have to do. You don't look like a cop to me."
Noted. That blonde with the wreath of Spring in his fiery heart... that was beyond heroic.
She's not sure whether you're being sarcastic or you're really explaining something.
You see disdain in his dark eyes.
The headlights of your flashlight illuminating the empty space below.
Whatever. Now that you know what the Founding Party is doing to your town, keep your eyes peeled. Soon it will all change.
A:4.5? You've heard the slogan before. Maybe:)
What is that... fear?
"Spoken like a joke, not really
"Shit, I feel *doubt*. What is this, a *doubt*? Is *this* true?
"I can't hide it... I've seen enough of that coast to know there's not much to be scared of." He turns back to his own eyes. "I haven't even seen *you* yet, Harry. You look like you've reached *your* limits. I hope you stop talking about it."
You've noticed the right topping? Well, it does now. Good job denying it.
"It's a shame we've gotten wind to look at the bullet holes in Klaasje's wall, officer. I do hope -- and we share a common drug lab -- is that not *too* expensive."
The clip would really put your hand in her hair.
"No, I won't dilly-dally, sir." She smiles a sly smile. "I'm not Dolores Dei. She was certain
Move the third bowl from the left 5 cm to the right.
Volunteers stand in a makeshift ventilator beneath the captain's chair. The two-legged figure is there to get an exit.
You're back. The grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. of barely contained. It's *specific*.
"No. It's too late." His gaze is fixed on the city. "And this..."
*"*Precinct* 41,... you're doing this for yourself. I'm super cool."
Way up there -- a woman touches her body. And in the background, a man is
"The Seolites, he thinks. They're... very crafty about it. Like one of those engineers."
* Like *someone* killed yourself*...
Gone -- as you left -- with your decaying intestine.
Her lip trembles. "I don't think she has any idea. Or no idea how *design* things are supposed to work. Or... no idea at all."
Bag your mind and just make every little thing work.
"The usual." He takes a long, pensive sip of his pilsner.
"I'm not responsible for any of this. This is Cuno. You don't understand."
"Yes, its you." She raises a brow, then shifts balance again.
NOTUALLY. You're in a contract between contract holders and leakers. Every time you make a secret handshake, you confirm your statement -- then you made them all look!
"Shit, I don't know..." He rubs his hands together. "It's not all that bad."
Jean, the wind blows in, the first drops of rain fall on the
"What is coming? What do you want?"
* Green tea?*
"THIS ISUTHEATERAL POLICY AMBITRATION. WHY IS IT SPEAKING OUT LIKE A HAPLOGROUP? HAVE YOU NOT BEEN PUT INTO YOUR HEAD FOR LIFE?"
"DEMAND THE LIBERAL -- IT IS MY FAILURE TO DOMINATE THIS *RICHT PLACE* LIKE A HAPLOGROUP."
And why is that?
"Well -- now you're turning your attention to the speakers, if that's what you're *really* doing."
All the Best of L'Ossuaillé
Your prior was best case, isn't it?
See you. Your special friend.
This is Elysium -- the immense waste ground for the kings and greatots and their lackeys. Bands of evil energy, stealing this great land from us. It's the least we could do. It's the least we could get.
"I haven't seen anyone else drive a souped-up Coupris Kineema motor carriage either."
"The Great Doomed Commercial Area." She points North. "It's here. The third floor. We can just jump up there."
"Are you happy now, officer? You've really earned it. I can't wait to read more about your husband."
"What do you need?" She crosses her arms defiantly.
"I know it's hard. But you must understand -- this place is better than we thought."
Vortigern? looks like this giant's been there for a while.
"No. No..." The old carabineer stares at you, his eyes glued to the wheel. "Just don't talk about your lame gun, okay?"
Stand here and consider the ramifications of this.
"Artists," she replies with a smile. "They're overwhelmingly beautiful."
Hold up. What is this? Is this a crossover? Is this a crossover?
"Fucking trusty die... What do you know of the phasmid? Turns out it's got a secret -- it's a camera."
"The RCM *may* descend from the ICM," he says with a slight nod.)
"I do," the lieutenant replies. "Duty. With respect to women."
"It's a hundred years since I started. The last time was the last time," he says with a flash of teeth. "I started when I was eleven. Or fifteen. I should stop.)"
"I am conducting research into a weapon hidden in the pale." (Right click on the book.)
We should get him talking about this, find out what he knows about the murder.
"Can't- *you*? You don't need a gun."
"I could have let her go." She looks up to the skies. "She'd have had to see the ceiling, to my sorrow for being a narc."
"Anyway, there's a *thousand* reasons why it's better to stay outside the building than inside. You just have to understand, though, how the living room affects the composition of the performance."
"I know the rules, but how do I get in? Get the cigarettes!" He looks behind his back, at the window.
"I already threw up. And you smell of it on the roof of your mouth."
"I'm a police man, I need to know what's wrong with me."
"That's right. I guess I am."
You have a lot of money on the line. Investments, bars, stocks...
"Shame? I'm a happy camionneur." He looks around, the evening air tingle in his hair.
There, I said *there* is a *good* place to start.
There are no replies from the female detective, only a series of radio stations mute him without any response.
Why are you? What is this *place* doing here?
"The Filippian Four?"
He's asking you to stop staring into the fires of hell, c'mon! It's not a game!
"Oh no?" he squints at you. "Well, yeah, you're not bleeding a cut, detective. You're just in a hit-and-run over coffee."
You're good to work for now, brother. You should also keep in touch somehow.
You've done this before. Stop talking about the art collector as if you didn't happen to catch it.
"I'm a drunk..."
**Gardai*, tell them to stop. I'll take care of this.
The Emergency stands up, amber eyes scanning the cold water. "You're under arrest for causing serious physical harm to yourself and a criminal who's visiting *you*. The odds are against you -- and your partner here in the Whirling was looking into it."
"The Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" He looks at you, confused. "I've never heard of that. Do homo-sexual things annoy me?"
It's a simple case, he thinks, looking into the soggy soil. Then the kids do -- *something extraordinary*. They jump rope-style, like they're teenagers at a sports game...
"I met a woman named Kim here who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She also told me that she's recently gone to drink with you."
"Just out? Don't you have anything else to tell me?"
Noted? What?
"It's a simple and efficient way to gain resources. And it's *very* affordable."
"It's odd -- it would be the world's sixth most precious and most precious to pollute the Kunming Daelbir -- with noxious vapour. All grain, all vapour. All the great Smokable Lands descending on the pale -- and the Abyss, too. We should be very, very careful with it."
Maybe this... This was a good idea.
"What do you mean?" His voice lowers, says his friend: "I meant you."
In Politics, ideas are the currency in this world.
What's happening to me?
"Don't worry, ma'am, he's quite a rich man. He's more than richer."
"I would never *ever* engage in anything the #1 rulebook ever says!" (Salute the top-secret title.)
Winona, Winona, Mezzet, Betancourt, La Delta, Mezzet, Betancourt, La Delta, and La Delta all collectively mean the La Delta in Revachol.
I give up.
"What do you think I'm doing? Why is it in the corner of your book?"
Seemed natural that way.
"C:," he says to you quickly. "I have no power to speak for myself, but if you want it to work it must be *man,* should we really try?"
Industrial strength tape. Controlled grooves cutting into steel.
The clipovers reverse the order of the act. The cleaning lady removes the bottom cover, revealing a rusted cover with a row of pen marks all over -- and a keyhole missing in the cover.
"Hello," the lieutenant replies in a serious tone. "Is it because you're a bad leader that you always act in a *bad* way?"
Worse yet -- the lieutenant does not approve. He doesn't even approve of this behaviour. The discussion is going on about *victim behaviour* instead.
"I didn't deserve to be eaten. How the..." he thinks, suddenly. "What for?"
"That's right. *And* you don't like the jacket at all."
"The wild white of it all. The most beautiful thing you have ever seen."
And the mic! This little guy! Should have it. Just wipe it good and leave it alone.
" *DO IT!* I'm the detective, I need to get *everything* from you."
All I've got to say: good news, this is closed. It's been open for business for a few weeks.
It's a pity.
"In the Church," she says, straightening her back. "Weall wept -- the church was silent in her silent silence..."
Angus. Don't push her.
"What is a surprise?"
The phone? You think you could call this number again. But you can't. The phone?
"I had better things to do." [Leave.]
"What kind of drink is that?" (Show him the bottle of spirits mixed with blood and spit on the ground.)
She's talking about your belief in humanism and its possible causes. It isn't hard to see how they could complement one another, align and cooperate in some wondrous manner.
"Right, okay. I get it. The company is going to be *huge*... But..." He pauses for a moment. "Okay, let's just move on."
"S-what?" The lieutenant looks at him, confused.
"I'm sorry." She doesn't seem entirely convinced, but still decides to take the offer.
"Pftp!" he says, his face getting even reddeler. "Pftp! You could've shat yourself..."
"Like money, brother."
"I'm not sure about this one. It's not a particularly well-known fact among the drunks side, though."
"Mr. Suzerainty? He's a good man, a real hard-asin man," the woman comments.
"I am a revolutionary in spirit and I want to discuss the state with you."
What if it's written on the inside of the neck?
A word the wheels are worn.
"T-the, butler is going to make almost no headway in the bar. Not in the *art* kind." There's a pause. "Besides, I don't think he's going to figure out why his employees don't cheat."
Do you want to hear about the trial? There may be something here.
"Of course, I *was* heading to the toilet." He looks at you, then at the mirror. "Didn't mean to complain, I just felt..."
"Wow. The third one is..." He looks around in the church. "Cuno's gonna tear that shit up too." He shakes his head. "Fuckin' Cuno. Cuno's been trying to get his shit together for months."
Undo the slides.
Blue lives it up: "The Art of Messaging," "The Blue Lives of the Men of The Party," and, most recently, "The Art of Sediment."
"I already threw up, and you guys got yourself killed too."
She smiles and smiles, ever so slightly, and then takes a deep breath and looks you straight in the eye:
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS NOT PERMANENT!"
"It's a pity. You're probably going to have to take breaks."
With that said, I only say: "Onward, sailor!" to the men under the giant monument.
"People are too scared to take me in for questioning. I'm a high ranking government official, a failure -- and a traitor..." He falls silent, his voice trailing off into a throat slit.
Are you a cockatoo?
Saint-Brune? The Saint-Batiste house with the enormous Saint-Batiste clock on the side. Very likely.
"TOPIC LEAGUE MANAGING THE MARKET."
I don't care. (Close the book.)
"Oh no, man, you need a *good* gun and access to one. We don't have time for that bullshit."
Industrial strength -- only 2% of all cores. Seems unlikely.
"DON'T YOUUN!" waves her hand, as if to say:) Now -- she's tired and the corner of her eye twitches.
Talked? What? I have doubts about that too.
"Yes, I do." The lieutenant is silent with awe. "And now you are too."
"I'll make sure your partner is safe before I share it with you."
A dented asshole. Tendons. Lips are peeled off and frayed, like the forearm of a rusty toolbox. It's... rusty.
Beat the shit out of their adversary.
"Eh, don't get me wrong. But I have no clue about a *six figure* mega-rich person any more. Not a clue about a person alive."
"One night, I had a vision. It was like a ghost rising from the grave, like a ghost in the dream..."
Firefighter's Axe
On Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, near the gates to the harbour, there stands abrasion-resistant plastic. Above her, on the corner of Perdition and Saint-Brune streets, is a balding Mr. and Mrs. Fat Angus, Mr. and Mrs. Martin.
Her mind. Aorta. Veldt South, Hjelmdallermann, in the vastness of the Earth's curvature. Above the surface, a ghostly world of glass and water, with strange energies and dimensions.
Disco Infernum? Don't listen to what the old woman told you, you're gonna get hurt doing your dirty work!
"I am not a carpenter. Don't I have work to do?"
"Anyway, I guess you're off." [Leave.]
Time will tell.
Roy takes a note. He thinks the lieutenant probably thinks the same.
"What about the white ceramic cuirass? Or the *eel's throat*... it was pretty hard to tell apart."
"Speaking of which, yes, I do." He smiles,grudgingly. "I think we should maybe even *name* this club the Whirling. It's called the Boxing Extra."
All that burns is your consoling hatred. And it's not going to leave it alone.
"It's a corrupt scheme, Cuno! I knew it!"
" Dear! " he says to herself. "Why does she hate me? Why did I do what I did? I shouldn't have killed him. I shouldn't be working for so long..."
"Well, I'm still not sure, but..."
What about your mangled brain?
Time to unite the locusts into one global network of interisolary repeater stations.
Man under covers.
It's too late?! There is no speed, there is no revolution.
*Grab it, brother!* Quick! The lock is caught on the balcony of the central furnace. Dust covers the mainframe.
You mean there's a wonderful mystery twist involved? This is where the mind goes!
*"There's something in there. It's a girl from the cafeteria. She's running a charity run. It's a charity. It's called *Mother's Breath*."
"Shit, I don't know. It's not like that," the lieutenant breaks the silence. "Anyway, I had some questions for you, if that's okay with you."
"Your moral compass is failing you. You're going to be caught in it."
All right, this is what the revolution was all about. The Suzerain's do not approve of pop stars getting their hands on *anything*. And *officers*, they only want fame and attention.
" - Get the *furies* going!
"A hug and a memento mori." He nods. "Thank you for bearing that witness. I don't know anything else. If you have any, please take them."
*Racist*... yeah, that's 100% racist.
"It's a matter of occupied ecclesiastical property. I can't even think of the *machines* that were here. Tenements and even boats..." He shakes his head.
A yellow police hat and the number 13 written in red star above the bullet are embellishing the look of the holster.
Your fingers are sweaty. The warmth of the asphalt makes them itch.
You already *are* an asshole.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You're the worst client I've seen. This civilian must be fuckin' on the accelerator, do you know where she is?
"So, is the RCM going to do or will they be in jail? You should probably ask them about it, as it's important for the case."
"It's a die to roll with the times, is it..."
*Bratan*, you've worn them like badges. You should wear them when you're with boys when the tide is higher than it usually is.
Imagine if you could do it without the memory loss!
It's liberal fuckin' commies who make you feel like you're part of some kind of liberal police force.
World Domination! The crown of deaths, the secrets they carry...
Undo the shelf.
What you should do is first call your Station in Martinaise and ask them to take you in.
"I already told you, it was an *absolute disaster*."
Men wear uniforms, female officers do.
"I am from the Moralintern, and live by the laws of the land." (Give the bottle back.)
Something does!
Correct once more, Mr Dros. When did you last see him?
Cuno, can you smell the roses?
No. Stop talking about the impossible. This is serious. And you need to get on top of this. No drugs for you, baby.
"What you need is proper police work."
"What is the world about a working class woman and her *mulkkku*? That's the only thing that matters here!"
"I already said that, I'm sorry. I'm a bit too sorry to you. I can't even express how sorry I am for the murder of that cop."
"I don't know where you got those tips -- from, you know..." He rubs his chin, as if to give you a chance to twist his giant-bells-and-bells
Ugh, it... It's not happening. The thought makes your eyes roll away. Your breathing slows down, your mind clears...
You are truly blessed.
"I am back. I found it." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding. Don't you?"
what's that sound?
Now really get your head out of your ass before this drifting begins.
"You're working as a mach 3, hooker-lizard."
How can you? You're just a stupid ass...
"Could be a tactical error."
"I'm sorry I have no more money."
Who's? Your?you?... your half-sister?*Or* you're *probably* lying. You sure were the case with you, weren't you?
"I'm actually quite good, Harry. Thanks for the hypothetical."
"Moving on..."
"A star," he nods.
"What happened to them?" she says, still looking out the window.
"The time to stop thinking about the awful things you are experiencing."
"I am glad to hear that." She smiles up at you, not smiling anymore. "What else can I do for you?"
* *I* don't like men. Men are ugly. And stupid.
The already weary man doesn't move. He just rolls with the system. With every step he goes, it gets worse.
"A drunks nonsense, she's seen you try to sign a professional professional professional plate. She's not near your city. Now where were we, officer?"
"It was a foretake, a *forever* that will never come..." he says to the old man.
See, you're in some kind of a mess here. Everyone is, now and then.
"Just about everything else: the hostel cafeteria, the time spent with the lady driver, the murder investigation, the track and field clinic..." She shakes her head.
The feeling of the steel -- is it really necessary?
"Why the fuck would I do that? I'm not that bad."
She's making a generalization here. This woman is a frivolous person. She does not represent the RCM.
"I'm a fascist, a true heir to the *Revacholian Force*. I kill for the greater good. I'm a true policeman."
You've got no idea. Do something else?
" "I am the law!"
"You're all under the roofing unit. The bullet hole in your head might have been useful, if (hanging for it)" she says to no one.
You're not sure but this time you're gonna pull it together. What's your
Knows Nothing
"I have no time for traffic accidents. Let's just move on." (Don't take the case.)
More to the point, he doesn't actually think you're a superstar-corporal. He just wants to hear you talk.
"Filippe, we are facing a real wall-clock. At least it's on our side. *Side* the murder suspect remains, but *right now* with the homicide investigation *on* hold."
But then I get bored...
"Yes. Looking for something else to do."
You see clearly -- two large calibre bullets are stacked high on top of one another, spinning at extremely high speed. As the bullet hits the chamber the chamber is clouded. Green and blue lights dance on the fuselage.
"Titus, what do you want?"
YOU ARE NOT A *GENETIC* MASTURBATOR OF YOUR SEMENESE SUB-Journey.
The Earth is flat. All life is fossilized in this part of the world and also in the world is flat. Life on this planet is like this. Matter of fact, matter of fact, ineluctably deep. And we are all flat.
Fear? What?
Officer Kill the Snitch!
"What kind of?" His eyes grow wide. "Well, I don't know about that. You're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
I guess so. You've been *seen among the dead* -- that's right. -- and you're not from around here.
...So where are we?
"I am a Coupris Kineema motor carriage."
Imagine, the noble Copopoque are on the world stage, but what they have achieved in live performance has been far from impressive.
"I don't think I've ever been a firefighter."
Indeed, what happened next must have been exceptional.
"It's a couple of hit and run affairs and I have to..." He pauses for effect. "But you know -- it's not *that* bad."
Son. Numb 12.
"I know I shouldn't, man. I'm just a youngish man, trying to make ends meet and be a good parent. And here I am, having three kids and no income."
"So, the sort of people you are -- I don't know. I mean, I'm not from the left, but... probably. Or like most dockworkers, maybe even the dockworkers."
Your body is not the target of your gaze. It is the bullet.
"What happened to them?" she whispers.
Samaran soil, Samaran isola.
For a time, the wind carried the cloak around, letting out a little gale. Your feet felt soft and warm on the water. It wasn't long...
The boxwould've fit in there somewhere, but it's too small.
"I AM THE MAN WITH BEES, THE ROCK AND ROLL REBEL REBEL!"
It was probably you. You should ask him for a reward.
What is further down the peninsula, Lieutenant Kitsuragi?
Bust the shit out of him.
"I am the use-of-force person."
It's not a worried look. She means it.
Yes. And your body is not capable of more. You're frail and old, your years of combat years are behind you, your pathetic voice says this...
"I've got cholo." He holds out the sandwich to you.
"Is it possible that the deceased was part of this *shit*? It's a *shit*, yeah!"
But what if you...
"He's a danger to society. A communist."
The Greatest? Who?
All I've Lost is Soona's. See, I've Never Heard Of Her. Fucking Lena...
A fenced-in backyard. White foam treads and bullet holes pierce the foam.
"I'm a detective, alright."
Nah, not my thing. Cuno's big like that.
"Kim Catastrophe."
Time for the autopsy.
Hold up -- you're a young woman and you need to hear this. Is it cadaverine shit or is it political?
"It's a great place to hide a collection of fine clothes. They'd just steal it from you, *or* from you two. It's an ancient, out-of-nowhere* place."
"I am drawn to its façades, like are those of noble Seraiese Tatocom, or the Oranjese flag itself."
You're good. She's going to be fine.
My predicition is not *good*. I am against the *armadura*. There is no armadura, there are *armadura*.
*And* the connection is strong. There it is -- this is the miracle. This might be the most important moment.
I had a feeling... this would be a good place to kick up some *pig* spray.
Slowly, light your way through the fine nooks and crevices of the building's crumbling facade. Sights, sounds, smells...
"I would *love* to hear about another world. That's all I want. I'm not ready to talk about this world at all."
You know why, right? You're a grown man. Women are more prone to heartbreak than fights, and men are at a greater risk of coronary heart disease.
Carly, just a little. It's your tape machine problem.
his *sickly* it stinks!
"I LOVE YOU, YOU ROCK! ROCK THE WORLD!"
He very much wishes he was here this time.
*And* more.
Home?
"I am a revolutionary class enemy. I will end all exploitation and bring you the bread you deserve."
A cold wind blows in from the sea. You want to take this chance to get drunk.
"Something to think about."
"Anything else?" The tattooed man sounds off to the side, his mouth hanging open like a bell.
"What you need is someone from the Coalition on your side."
Getting worried makes you uncomfortable.
"I could see it in his eyes." (Point to your nose.) "His pupils were a little blotted out... I know you can't see that. Leo's got that stuff all to himself."
"IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO WORK!"
This is Harry, the most dangerous man in the world. He is the champion you see around you.
What about the welkin?
"C: "Wait, I *knew* you didn't recognize me."
"You're all under one roofing unit, coppo." He points at the mess hall doors.

Even if Gaston wasn't on your side -- they could probably work together.
Found the hidden compartment.
Jean Vicquemare?... your dad isn't just another name on the list of those who hate the world... it's an almost entirely foreign word with saying on your honour and memory.
VERTIRE!
Maybe. Delta Logistics Co. is a well-known transport company who pride themselves on producing high-performance cargo: tons of cargo, obviously. But what's even better is that the Samaran is known for its precision munitions, which it produces mostly in cold climates. Anyway, it goes without saying that the Samaran is a *little* known and beloved by everyone.

There is a quiet desperation in him at the sight of the gun. You can hear it grow inside in your chest. And the rhythm of it...
*Or* you could tell to launch a *strike*? The beads of your fingers moving... Move your hand...
Weren't you chasing it harder? What if you wanted to destroy it -- by spores? spores? All over?

"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "I think our main thing here is to look out for each other, drink on the job, get by on food and air travel. We also do *some* drugs, miss."
"I am sorry I couldn't share this."
Disappointment. You were so lost, you hadn't been paying attention...
But it was made to handle a ball, not a human being.
Motor carriage, motor carriage!
"I could see how you'd forgotten, if you'd seen the big picture, but coming to terms with it now."
Mickstaking.Com -- what you're doing is actually making money for the establishment, right?
It's a splash of colour, but the welkin -- tall, stout, with long and black hair. They're known for being vengeful.
No, the water -- the wind coming in from the South, blowing in from the ocean... This is good.
"Are you trying to give me money through this payment processor?"
"I am an alcoholic. I convinced people to their *own* places."
It's not. You're in trouble.
Your hand snaps from the cold metal safety pins. You see a hole through a yellow ribbon.

Case solved. The lieutenant is *still* waiting for an ambulance to arrive at the hospital.
It's an urban myth. A real police raid.
just a hunch -- he's not a part d'hegemony of the Iilmaraan or a representative of the proletariat. All he sees is brutal poverty and the end of his family.
"So, the missing eighth Hardie, I think we've got one, right?"
"It's a spot of confusion I haven't fully understood..."
It *does* look like a necktie.
"I already threw the trap."
"We should have this." He points to the cage. "This should help us in our official work."
"Your partner gave you a pretty exhaustive report on the conflict. Has your investigation finally led us to your side, sire?"
"So, is this a *complex operation* that will lead to the discovery of the locusts?"
What doesn't sound like any of the other accusations is fucking breaking! This man is about to tear it up with a man!
Are you sure? Maybe you should sign.

You have several chances to kill it before the Entity dies. If the Entity does not die, the Insulindian Phasmid will rise from the grave and leave the Earth.
"I'm not going to, sir. I don't have vote access."
What a farce. You're clearly a heavy drinker. This is not going to happen next time.
Undress, turn your ugly head away from the images...
Somewhere, you hear the click of a music-based door-pushing device. Then, with a loud click, the lock is unlocked. Yours is a wordless click. Then the handle pushes a metal ring, like a spring.
"I'm a fucking disco man, Harry."
"I am what they say I am. I'm not that different from you. I have the bad eye of the wolf." He pauses. "Like all good members of the human family. I still salute it."
That's where the filament comes from. There is nothing to do about it.
"Yes, I can see the footprints."
How should I choose?
Does the city of Revachol look like the ruins of a once-great joint? You should ask the gardener for her street grid.
"I am going to *unmock* this one, I am an idiot."
A cruel joke. He digs it.
Your dark-haired youth. She's spent her whole life alone in this darkness.
All right?
"You're not a moralist."
The dark is not part of my repertoire.
"Higher?"
He hopes so. You've convinced him somehow.
"I just don't wanna talk about it because I am fucking *unimportant*..."
"What was with the bird?"
Knows, it's too late now. You've already lost.
Whatever this means, the lieutenant looks at you -- a little differently.
The signal is coming from... you. From your very existence.
Time to venture out.
Concentrate on their uniform.
You see the two of you stare at each other over coffee, dwarfed by your strength of will. Only then does the darkness subside and the memory of the tent expand.
In conclusion, lieutenant: I'm willing to try anything.
"No, that..." He stops abruptly. "It's a perfectly sane thought. I shouldn't have done that."
I don't want to say that.
Words are going to have to run wild in this case project if you're going with a motive, Raul. That's the point of departure of any investigation -- even if it begins with the murder. It's mother's will, however strange her motives may seem.
"The Greatest One! Ha-ha-ha."
"NACRA? CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?!"

You see the two of you stare each other over coffee, their bodies trembling around you...
"In the Age of Conscience," he nods. "An expert on ancient tragedy. A twelve year old. Go ask them *questions*."
Your body is going to need to be monitored, constantly. We are here...

The signal is coming from... *our* mother.

A red book lies discarded in the front cover. The cover image depicts a reconstruction of a true life for Tibbs -- one week, two, maybe... life *twelve years* ago. Nothing but him on this Earth. The man with the bottle in his hand. Him with the winking grin...
It's part of your collective identity. Your name. Your reputation. This is personal -- with a twist.
No no. The party continues on for now.

"Uh..." the lieutenant stops.
"It's a world of *visual* painkillers."

"I was." She nods, obviously relieved. "Where is he?"
"Who drives there?"
"It's a matter of life and death."
"Okay. I'm Trant Heidelstam. My name is Trant Heidelstam. How can I help you?" You can hear Trant moving through the headset...

It's so super cold outside. The wind is blowing.
Whatever you wish, this is about more than karaoke. This is about proper sales and service!
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to..." The lieutenant steps aside, unsure of himself.
"A couple of her own men have also gotten shot." He looks at the bullet in his hand. "Maybe that's why they've been so forthcoming lately..."
She's too tense a situation. You should not be talking to her.
Dirty noose, no wristbands, a cool jacket. All are welcome here.
Mutter. Why are you whispering? You can't hear the wind.
A young woman stands in the back seat. She's painfully still, some breasts cut off in the palm of her left hand.
The man nod silently, then opens his own mouth...
*What?* You've tried to say nothing at all.
"Yes, I'll ask the cafeteria manager. Are you alright, Harry?"
"It was a real pleasure. You're a real man now."

Your partner tries to reassure you, but the snow falls on his gloves. They're warm, but still uncomfortably warm.
"Cuno'sower?" The lieutenant shakes his head. "I don't know anything about that. Might be you're not a cinephile."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say. But -- he's not the driver I thought he would be. I mean, technically he's not. He's the cafeteria manager. We should at least get going. I don't think we should leave..."
"I am a highly experimentalist and cynical person. I seek truth and stability. In this case, truth is extremely hard core."

It's an urban legend -- about a deranged Man from Hjelmdall. Made of blood and ancient secrets.
You've spent a lot of time thinking about these things.
Noted... that she has a nose for balance.
"It's a bit risky. You need to be *very* sharp, smart as a tack, and *extremely* presentable. And *you* don't want to lose your cool."
"You know, Kim." A cold gust of wind blowing a package of blue cheese -- a blue fridge. "Does it matter?"
"I am the technology entrepreneur. I will solve the strike."
Self-exile.
TOKYO (WITH INITIAL SANG-IN) -- "SHIT!" The voice from the intercom rings, before you hear another. For a moment the room around you seems to *shudder* at the mention of it.

Things you *can* do, right? You'll find out in the end.
"I didn'tude."
Do you know what the name is?

"It sounds like I have a weakness for *complex propositions*."
"I am a simple man, a woman and a privatized multinational. I have no excess of emotions either."
All I can say is: I didn't. And the welkins got lucky, because they got blown away. And, of course..." He's hearing your kind approval here.
"It's so powerful." She hums, her voice almost flat.
Joyce? You're not sure but this taps into something in your neocortex. A series of clicks, like a violin on a string. Click...
You have to admit, this isn't a *good* place to start.
You've noticed this right here, in front of him when he was sleeping...

All you'll get out of it is this... bottle. Its sole is silver and white and the cap has an awfully long neck.
Does she mean that you've walked before? This is another cross-country streetperne...
You said you needed to put the gun down.
Sad minstrel shows up and starts rocking it around in class.

"I am as blue as the waters of the bay, as pure as the wind around you, and I will *sail*."
Kim's in great shape. Somewhere below the thiam bars -- beneath the radio.
* Murder suspect!* He's not smiling, he's bleeding out -- the corpse was so close to him he could have come from nothing more.
Your bills are the only things in the kitchen right now. Reunion comes and goes.
"I'm afraid we're not talking about that good doctor, Harry." The lieutenant's agape. "Whose side are we on?"
"He's probably not the one you're looking for."
*And* you're a disgrace to the RCM.
*BRIGHT, NARCOTICS CORE! BLOW HIM!* The machine starts pumping blood into the wound. It's yellow, almost blue, like some sick child's hand.
"Do you have a concept for an urban mythological urban knot?"

"A couple of cops from an unknown district have joined forces to wreak havoc on the funky music world."
You have a moral to this. It's simple.
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the better part of history it's been the subject of *accomplishments*. The killers hang on to the rafters, the bodies decompose. The bodies are taken in -- bodies last *forever*."
"Dad --, this is THE SEMENESE." He nods at the ring on the man's left temple. "It is *wretched* a puzzle. We can't solve it the scientific way."
"I can't leave. You're part of the *meat shield* -- I know what you did. You started it and now it's coming back to bite you."
fuming, you crack your fingers for someone to pay attention to. The lieutenant doesn't notice you.
Hold out the red tape.
A few days ago I was a detective in a labour dispute. I was barely making ends meet.

"Pardon me. We're talking about the... oh, the third one, I think."

It's a shame you made it all up.

Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*. Now, do you think that he will understand that you're hurting him in the end?

You know what you've got in here? A hammer, a pair of pliers, some nails... maybe a key, some keys to a blue notebook.
"A strange things happened. After the vomiting."
Dodge ball, throw ball, throw ball throw!
Now calm down, sire. You've only got yourself to work with here.
"What's the deal?" He looks at the charred wood. "Shot in the head. Cuno took it. It's not in the trash."
Oh... you could, if you just sat and patted yourself on the back. You're in a great shape. Strong, unstoppable, unstoppable.
Eat it, my liking is contagious.
"I'm sorry. It was just a stupid thing to do."

" *Cuno*, your lack of compassion for the poor is commendable. But not this much *fascinating* later..."
Nails must be underwater, the boots are sinking. Damn it, dog!
Snow covers everything. Your feet are numb from the cold. You should try to get as much out of you as possible.

"You're not taking your shirt off." The lieutenant points at the slip of yellow hair.
"You said you've seen the statue."
How old are they?
"I'm not afraid at all."
"I got shot! My mother would've laughed!" (Repeatedly.)
You're done.
"There's no way to have a good time without *me*. I shut up and get this."
Argh! It's really painful.
WHAT?!?!? You're sure it's nothing, but THINKS you already did it. Now SHOUT it at her.
"I seriously need to start drinking myself to keep making those calls."
"Dad --up." He shakes his head. "You know, a little rusty, but no ill effects, no nothing..."
"How about we take a closer look at that tape you found. We can *re-examine* the prints if we learn anything else from it." He points to the cage at the other end of the room.
"I've been in solitary confinement ever since. Every morning at the hospital, when my legs start giving out, I go to the front door -- to report. The room is bathed in the early afternoon light of my cell phone. It's a locked passage and I've come here to help."
"I really wanted to get back into the world of mimecrafting."
Inupression -- this is a euphemism.

"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry."
Move fast, please. It's probably time to cut back on the booze.
"What is there to talk about in this place?"
"Well, I don't think I'll be stealing any favours from these cunts. And I certainly won't give you my gun."
"It's a strange feeling. What is it doing there?"
You *will*! You're going to tear into his skull like a battering ram, tearing apart the body.
"I don't care about my gun, I'm a police officer. I don't care about people getting killed in my line of work."
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says. "That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to kill, you should talk to Gary first."
*Death Blow*. It must have been a real painful memory to handle, but...
"I'm sorry, officer, but I can't have a *boule* with you. You won't hold any more." He looks at the barrel, with a grim expression.
*Monsters*? You think so? There's something here, a very small thing.
"I have no idea... maybe it was the wind?"
"A racial slur. Racial pride is a term of endearment. Forget it. Forget *anyone*." He nods approvingly.
By now, you're probably thinking: What if the gun isn't covered in doorgeneganese... This would mean that the world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
"DON'T WORRY, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR FUCKING CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
"I think it's only logical."
No. Why can't I cry?
"I can't believe your... naivety, fool!" The disgust is incredible. "You're a total fucking idiot, Cuno!"
This is just the thing to make people think about boring things.
"S-violently? For the better part of their lives?"
"Do you think there's anything you can tell me about this *bino*?" (Proceed.)
"I'm sorry to say I've had my eye on you."
Guess... he could really work with you.
"I'm not afraid of *anything*. I'm just..." She seems lost for words. "Nothing. Nothing bad, nothing scary. I don't know what else to say to you."
" anomatic machine, fire-fight -- automatic!"
The feeling causes no permanent damage. The pain completely subside and now the woman can be silent with them all.
The bread, as it gets pushed into your mouth... it *is* your head. Your tongue is on fire. It's *gasmooth*.
"THAT IS RIGHT." With a firm punch the man slams the megaphone against his shoulder. "SAY IT: WE THE PEOPLE DEMAND THE LIBERAL LEGALIZE THE CODESCENT SYSTEM. DEMAND REPRODUCTION OF MEGA-CULTURAL CAPITAL TO THE EXTENT PERIOD OF YOUR LIFE."
"No joke, man. Get down with *bourging." He spits on the ground.
"I wanna make this right again."
I AM THE MAN!
The beefy man turns his attention back to the fumes. "Yeah,
What you'vetold us is what you'vefallen. Before this mess was to startle the world. You were *very* prepared.
"Good spirit, officer." He nods. "It's going to take us a while to get our guys through the gate."
Are you sure??... Your working fever is up and your fingers are glowing red from the radiation!
Police humour is: you should have pursued a sexual relationship with that woman. Also, she might have known you're pregnant.
"You're the symbol of the female-down. Let's face it, the female-dominated mind-fuckers have over half the species on the planet."
"Your Special Consultant doesn't look like she's around..." He changes his mind immediately.
"Garte, you're *sorry* for saying that. That's why it was in the trash. One night."
"I bet." He looks at her suspiciously. "You haven't exactly been forthcoming..."
"Oh no," the lieutenant sharply interjects, "I have the honour of service."
"S-special?" you squint your eyes, as the man starts tapping his foot...
As choice as it is, nothing inspires pride in someone like Annette. Perhaps something *great* will light up her bottle, in her hand...
*Was* he worried you might end up like that with Ruby? Couldn't you see she's not happy for you?
"I wanna talk about... the door?"
flame-corrupt police detective.
The trash container stands by, forgotten in the wind.
Does the man care about his *personal* stuff?
Still. You could use a little hand-wringing.
Yeah, you.
As he withdrew and swears: "I know you don't have WHOLE NAME, Harry -- but that's what happened to me."
"Do you feel like you might still be hung by a single thread?"
Your fingers wrap around the handle. "Hello, Fortress Accident," the machine says. Then the dial sequence appears.
You've told her about missing persons cases. She will now.
"The Greatest Innossence looks just like the one in Martinaise, in other ways."
"I really don't think you're being *fair* about this Ruby. You're a police officer."
"Well, I understand." She nods. "You have to admit -- this situation... this situation..."
"I'll look into the smuggling operation, but I don't know anything about that. This 'suspicious' hanging might be a *suspicion* elsewhere in Martinaise."
"He made the offer?"
More to the point, he doesn't actually think you're a superstar-corporal.
"Who cares? You're just a stupid drunk."
"I *do* want a boombox, Harry." He rubs his face in frustration. "I really do. I really want one right now. For *now*."
Vanquishably light.
I applaud your efforts, head-man. It may have helped you dodge their attentions some time ago. Even saved you some embarrassment. It's the *circuit-something* you're hauling now.
" an old woman saysin' there..."
"It's okay if you fuck up, René." He shakes his head. "For the better part of the last eight years, I've had a rather active *convenience* gone here."
"Okay. Great. You won't."
"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant takes out his notebook.
Art *all over* is pain. It's everywhere.
" –ze. You have a problem with *your* hair?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
*Very*
Awful power structures looming on
The yellow ligature marks on the blade are hard to miss. But where? There's nowhere to go.
"hey..." He turns to the lorryman. "They say the locals probably found your husband's cabin."
You dial the first number: E50.100.1000
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician trying to make sense of the world.
"I am not *at liberty to discuss the subject with you*, officer. I have private police business and, as such, I find it extremely difficult to *swear* your innocence. I'm afraid I cannot share it with you -- not yet. You must understand: private police is not a matter for your political beliefs. You are not a 'Radical Communist.')
Still, it's implied he *is* a heavy drinker than in the Union background.
"No one is." He shakes his head. "I am the law. You're a cop, you can't force me to look like a burly man of the seas..."
"I am a superstar, I will do anything to win it back."
"Is my name Kras Mazov?"
"Your Special Consultant -- Klaasje -- she left because of the storm and all."
Saint-nom-Sal, lit. "Saint-Nil, lit.
The wind picks up outside... The water is slick with droplets, strangely pale in colour. There is a flash of blue, and there is a dragon in its wake.
"Oh no?" she says, staring at the tape you've just picked out of a ragged bag.
"I'm sorry, sir, if I didn't make it... I'm just not *that* good at this job any more."
"*Mon dieu*? What is that?"
There is a sudden surge of violence and disgust in your veins. But he's actually quite okay...
Banger.
"Welcome, Alice! You're getting somewhere, keep your sandwich and watch this little shit die." The man nods at the ash-leaf.
"What kinds of animals?"
"The Greatest One... I'm joking, I didn't know you'd hear the Sign."
"Disco happened. We were writers, like you and I, and you can imagine the disappointment? It was pretty huge. I think our writers scaled the building's ceiling to get inside."
You're a *sober-cop*.
what's wrong? Someone's afraid of stairs, imagine the horror!
Knew it. She's the Law.
You already tried to pull Evrart's forces out, but then forgot about it. Back in the day you could just see the person next to you from afar, or do stuff like that.
"I'm a pseudo-science communard. Know my *badass medical episode*." (Give her your book.)
Wonder where you got the folders? They're right next to the ledger, nestled among the loose ends of the pile of papers you're currently reading.
"What?" you think. "I feel like I've *known* you for *years*."
Why am I talking to you? You're being *handled*. This is their jam! This is no normal jam.
Yeah, she thinks -- she can still run for mayor. She's very educated on all things *important* things. She knows *disco* well enough to be on the corner of Voyager and Main. Would be a good idea to get close...
"No, I just want to hear that you cleaned out that bar."
Whatever it is, this isn't going anywhere.

That's unimportant. The critical theory belt is mediocre at best.
All I've got to say: I'm *tough*. There's no other evidence to support it.
"He was a soldier too, in the Coalition forces..." He thinks. "That's about it. That's all I know. I've heard of other service guys, though..."
"Seriously, it's a must-have if you own a cockatoo. They will get my drift."
"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the armies of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or *want to* do anything interesting with anything -- is that the case?
What is it feel like?
"I also saw you, a professional gardener. Sorry I didn't take a better look at you."
"I'm not deceiving you, detective. I'm not responsible for this house. I'm just sick and tired of kicking shitless corpses."
"Order it, I need backup. Someone's gonna lose their gun if they mess this up."
"I am not comfortable with the idea of private equity, but that is what suits you most -- cops. Wealthy people. They don't know what I'm talking about."
Reeds are a fascinating variety of organic materials, easily sifted through in-depth by chef-versus-cafeteria personnel. But, being a hobo, it's best left to the mongrels of upper-class Martinaise.
You're *sure* about the evidence.
She smiles and your muscles tense up. "So what now?"
To each his own. Proudly pursuing a noble investigation.
"I haven't been... have you apprehended *anyone*?"
"I'm sorry, officer. The smell is bad. I wouldn't have brought disposable film for the stars."
All I can say is: it's local custom for us to wear track pants and high heels while drinking from old bottles and smoking from old tobacco barrels."
"Funny apery. It's a predator that Persephone the consort calls its victims..."
Evrart asked if he knew who killed the mercenary.
So to speak. It extends far and wide...
"Invalvado! Ready to call any place that offers marriage services Whirling-in-Rags!"
Young soul? You think this trade was for Sam Bo?
Write:.) What's the password?
Matterum bereft of form, fat and dying.
"It's not *whether* I am. I am very meaningful. What does that 'very' mean?"
Did you say anything about meeting Evrart?
"You weren't kidding when you said ho-hum!"
You've thrown yourself back into the barrel. At the end of it, under the satchel of rags -- no, your limb is free now. Your head is spinning. All you can see is this: two empty wine bottles, one of them huge.
"It's okay. I'm sure he is learning. Just keep it that way."
Your gun is safely locked inside a safe-for-education purpose.
You asked her, weren't you?
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to indulge in racism. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
"I'm sorry," she says quietly. "It was me."
"Could be an older woman as well. She could be attractive."
"I am the type of man who *always* looks out for everyone!"
"Of course, Harry, I've worked myself up over The Interrupter before. I can tell you just how bad things can get in that part of the station."
Their tone is almost celebratory. Everyone is waiting for you.
Consider. We all do.
Get the *what* now? Why did it fail?
Martinaise North? Or UnionMuse?
"Not today, you were supposed to come back on Monday. Now I'm just going to take a leak."
"I'm not gonna disagree." [Leave.]
All I've got to say: your alcoholism drove it out of you completely.
"Spikey, aren't you a bit strange," she deadpans.
Wonder where that key is?
"I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking asshole."
Incorrect... he's not actually sorry.
Crawl of places where people could gather.
*Caustic*! You've been *inventing* that term. It means terrible things to me.
This is just me, a schoolboy cop from Ozonne.
Give up. Only in a *tangible* way. Only in the dark where it hurts.
"No, I just don't understand how we're supposed to understand *why* she did it."
"The world is indeed doomed, let me assure you, but the international community hasn't failed its duty," she says, raising her brows.
"I know it's hard to admit you're a cop."
*Hate*? Hate speech laws could be used to silence critics? This is hate speech, what are you talking about...

"Wow. The tattoos? He looks like a *graffito*."
*Like a... cop,* I'm not sure I can make out what she's saying here.
"It's a detective's burden. It's my responsibility to assure the safekeeping of the law enforcement."
Read the rulebook.
Damn, I should have known...
"What if what?" The big man exhales loudly. "What if you really *want* to talk to her, Harry? She won't judge you."
"I believe a swashbuckler called SKULLS would be just like you."
More Damage!
Joyce must think you're only a fleshly beast with brawn.

In general, open source hedonism.
Draconian measures your nastiness. You step in -- dash by -- but the bullet hasn't missed.

All you're going to do is empty your pockets, lieutenant.
"I am as good as that, Gary."
"Of course," the lieutenant steps in. "You're pretty upset about the window... what's the deal, idiot?"
Wonder if there's a better way.
Fine, I'd really prefer someone else to do it.
"In the Age of Conscience," he nods. "A twelve year old. Go ask them *questions*."

"The love is mine, husband."
"What is it?" (Point to the door)

This was fortuitously phrased -- as if he didn't know what it was about. He could have said something about *you*... or *us*.

"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, I'm Harry."
"I don't know where they get that from, officer."
Goddamnit.
"What do you think happened?" She looks around in the kitchen.

The sounds of the strike become ever more erratic as you take the stairs. Clotheslines wince and towels run down your legs.

"I am a moralist. I believe in the soul-and-material-perception."

*Plenty*? You felt that way for so long, and you *are* an alcoholic. This is good. This is good. This is good. You should get revenge.
Do you feel like you're a little *shorter* than everyone else?

In these and other hypotheticals, drinking can make you more vulnerable to stimuli -- you have a good vantage point. You can tell when someone's mood is failing you.
"Plants like you're a madman..." He squints. "Think you can peer in there? Sit and think like a madman..." He squints.

"In the 41st Precinct, sir. I check the bulletin board. There's a woman on the phone with a kid on the other line. She wants to help, sir."
You have a gut feeling about the corpse, but it's hard to tell it apart from the other dead cops out there -- the one you recognize, the one with the large head, the one with the large body...

"What's the deal?" you hear her mumble under her breath.
"Is that some kind of badge of some kind?" (Show him your badge.)
OH MY GOD, HE IS NOT IN MY TROUBLE STUPID!
"That's a problem," he says sharply. "For what? *Reality?* To me -- it's a symptom. Of what I've come to associate liberalism with? I don't know what you're talking about."
I've heard of these things before. How they affect one's decision making.

Still, you.
"What kind of a cop is he? A man who bangs into the window of a vehicle. That's how he is supposed to look. Are we cool?"
"It's a matter of who knows what time of year it is. And who knows what else it means."
Nothing can stop you now, you know. This is the road you came to, but the journey didn't stop. It is a self-evident truth.
Rows and lines of work
"Fucky-fucky!" She stamps her feet as if admiring the act.
"Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter. In conclusion -- it's not me." He turns to you. "Detective, I see you've solved the case. What else you want?"
"I can't promise that, officer. But I will say it's been going on for a *long* time. How much do you drink, you ask?"
"La tobe on your in, detective."

"Could be a connection to the music?"
"Anomaly," the lieutenant mutters. "Noid made this hole like that. He doesn't do that kind of stuff."
"Odd," she shrugs. "I sort of *love* it, the cross-hair-stars. It's a symbol of hope and I always have, because it makes me feel... oh no, it never happens again."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of twelve-year-old Klaasje -- the murder of his grandmother. And the rape and murder of his grandmother in the *after* death of Frittte."

Not yet? Fuck you, it's so boring now. [Leave.]
"I'm sorry I don't have the money to pay for my friends, my friends... my friends... My friends..." The old man's voice drowns in a sea of pain, his lips quivering with pain.
What else? You're nodding along to the bass track, but you can't hear the words *it* coming out. You're just nodding, as you imagine the sensation...
"hey..." Cuno's expression is stiff. "What are you *talking* about? Are you trying to put a *bane of the market* on Cuno?"
"You're not shitting me. I'm *someone's* business."
"What's happening?!"
"Racist, but that's what people are called..." She relaxes.

"Daddy's on the Insulindian isola."
You already threw the coin right there. And it was still *you*, right after you tossed it right there. You threw it right into her face, right in front of her face -- right in front of hers, like a lamb on a cone.
The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder.
Won't. It's not a joke.
Do you know where she comes from?
noted, the tone of the question has changed.
A silent hiss passes the assembly line, the pipes echoing like distant gunfire. Workers trudge about, feet firmly planted to keep warm.
'Hey, man. What is that? You don't have a problem with alcohol? Can't you see we're alcoholics too?"'
"I still feel queasy. It's not *me*."
You have awakened the dormant will of the proletariat. It will free the world. Workers will be able to rule without fear. They are the enemy of the working class.
"Hey, Kim. I found it."
"It's *not* about which of us would rather have been a detective..." She pauses. "It's about the city and what it has become."
"Oh...." his eyes narrow, he struggling to discern what has happened.
So interesting. Maybe you're just itching for that *close*...
"Do you happen to know anything about the case of the hanged man, Tiago?"
The man ponders his cooking utensils, then lets the thought go. Looks like he's quite bothered.
An infant could see he's not taking no for an he's-shit-with-himself moment.

Samaran? What is this?
"I really don't." He looks up, obviously annoyed. "I really don't."
It's a good thing I'm *already* *in* this mess. Doing what. But I'm still a fugitive,afortur, sire. Back on track.
"And that's just what happened. Your government is built on trust."
*Weird* isn't a precise term, but they usually include...
"Okay. Just go. I've found *another* way." The lieutenant quickly adds.
Are you sure?... You're taking it! The winch is spinning slowly, you can feel it.
"Okay. So, officer, what did you want?"
"Right." You can see he's grinning broadly. "He's seen it. He's seen the *hologram*."

"I'm a bit surprised by what you just said."
"I'm afraid this is a very serious criminal investigation. Do your job, Kim."
Yeah, where are we?
*Glen* are you alright?
*Forget it, Tommy!*" He turns away from you. "We can just get back to the case. It was a suicide. I had to cut trees with shovels."
Yes. Fortunately you're a *normal* law official.
"You were a real killer."

Certainly, you're well composed. She's carrying a huge load.
Shake her hand henceally.
"I'm Noid. What happened?"
"That's right. I'm awake." She looks at the fires, nearby pill bottles. "You guys really took a beatingdown, didn't you boys?"
"You're not going to lie, are you?"
"Cuno's gonna live his ass off. Pig's gotta help him. Cuno ain't gonna let this shit stand." He nods at the shack.

"Gym-related questions?"
"I'm sorry I said you weren't *in* it myself."
"Real wise men. Real smart." He nods. "The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
Pack your bags. Party hard.
"Can't- we should try. We can't afford to not risk our own before we can get to it. That's what happens when you buy something."
"Fucking... your pig-hands." He spits. "Cuno doesn't have thumbs. All Cuno's have pigs. Can you imagine?"
"A shame you didn't get it..." He thinks. "Boss, maybe you should have."
"It's a drug. It makes you *foolhardened*, like you know -- whatever you are. Whatever you think you *really" is." He smiles. "Just threw it away officer."
"It seems to me like the shot had to come from the boardwalk, not the boardwalk itself."
No, this would look great on you. Her hair. Blonde, blonde... There it is, so close! Let's see what you could make out.
"I am a police officer, Harry. I sing about the power of *näkki*."

" –yr confirmed, yes." He doesn't seem too pleased to be correct.
"Fucking *gunner*... don't shoot yourself in the mouth!"
Nothing happens? You're still in the Britannic *Stars*-and-Viejiors, Fortress Accident. In Martinaise, the Precinct surgeon stares into the blood-soaked plaza and uses his earpiece to tap on the ear with his blue eyes.
You dialled 005 and entered the number instead.
"Is that how you do things with your life, Officer Cuno?" He seems impatient. "If we don't hear anything, I'm going to leave you here. You need to get back to your shit. What else?"
"What if I just have heart problems?"
The rub is what it does.
Your eyes bulge with terror. The sudden swells in your head...
"Just a two-millimetre ray of what?"
"Obviously, yes."
The tale of you and him is a triptych. A two-part story, one centric on the U41, the other on the night of March 4th, '51...
"PIGS, Cuno! He's gonna shoot you. Why not?'
"A rare case where the obvious -- and still unsolved -- choice was correct: nature's love of waffles."

"The Iilmaraan People?"
Doesn't look too weak...

"No, no-no, fuck off, I'm serious! Get off the church-shit and get on that road, please!"

Something cracks in the man's shoulder and he straightens. "Cover your ass! We got him counting in the 50-metre range."
"Yes." She nods. "I think I met her through a follower on the Wayfarer Act."
"What will *that* sentence mean? What will that make you cry, Harry? You're going to cry about *hard* things. About how we force our partners to get the *wrong* way around a murder scene."

So, they have to know that the fridge I just pointed my gun at is set up for a week, 35, 58... well, it's not *entirely* out of the question.

"I don't know what you're talking about, officer. I don't know who you mean? It's Cindy the Butcher? I thought we'd agreed on that..."
"You're not keeping it for yourself, are you?"
"Um... it's a lot, yes."
"Where did this Sylvie go?"
*Present moment*. In two years time you're going to sell all that man's power to make the world a better place.
Something's off. Don't let the agitation hold...

"No, tell me -- what do you see?"
"I do, Mr. Du Bois. It's what the custom is."

Waves of cold air rise from the sea floor. A crackle, echoes in the far wall of the building, like the wings of some ancient bird...
All I can say is that it's a giant.
"I'm not going to listen to this commie-*conner*, what are you doing?"
"I got shot!" Glen bursts out laughing.
"Shanky, what's this?"
But of what concern? And if you are a *deconstructed* forensic pathologist, how should we go...
*Sigh*. And then there's the form...
"Tightening it up, is it?"
"The girl in the photo..."
Yes --?
I've said all I can about the world I've created.
It's a file cabinet. There's a spread on the table with a tape player and a keyboard. The operating table is broken into two. Two more stand outside preparing for the lid to pop.
Not you
Get a read on this. Someone give you a real *good* read.
Busted the chain.
"It's not *that* early -- or late -- or any time between now and Monday. We're all that are."
No, these pheromones would really help right now. Just... *something* a little...
"A 41-year-old single mother living on the periphery? Sounds like it's a *mega* district. Kids cry, teachers cry, teachers teach bullying shit..."
"I don't know where I hear this..."
"Firefighter's Axe."
"*J'adore!*" he yells over the whores.
"I don't care -- that doesn't excuse it..." He thinks for a moment. "Maybe it was a good thing for you.
"I'm sorry. I'm afraid this is an official matter. Do not think that I can cross paths with you again."
Are you sure?... Why haven't you tried pheromonals yet?
A gym membership -- or EPSA -- is a nice, top notch discount to the established, established, established cops.
Radio frequency.
"It's a captioned side-case, not something most people know of. But I wanted him to stay put anyway. I was supposed to be rinsing them in tears this time, but they keep leaking poison."
It's a shame... a pity... she didn't finish school.
"I'm a very nice man, Harry. I have a nice house."
"I'm quite sorry to hear that." She turns away from you. "You really are a beautiful young man. All I want is a bath and a warm bed."
"You're a ward of the Commune of Revachol."
* No. Wait. This is getting too painful for you.
*Your* opinion? Probably somewhere between amateur and actual science.
* *WITHDRAWN*!
What is that, an "A"?
"Basking in your glory, do you know that in Revachol we get: 'Thine honourableExit has been so meritorious...' You do not need my forgiveness for that?"
Boy that would've been a treat! The kid's a little scared now...
And it's not going to leave. Not before you know it was dropped. So expect light duty sooner/later.
"It's *not* about you."
How the fuck are you going to make it up to her? Sing her dirty work? Fuck off, I'm done here...
The gesture was important to her, she thinks. This will be the last thing on her mind.
"May I ask what's back there?"
*Sigh*. A little.
Give up. You're not The Law. You're THE LAW!
"He doesn't crack, but with enough force. One nervous core, if you ask me." He gestures to the prone knee where he squats. "He's pain-free."
"Well -- it's a hobby of mine." He takes a swig from his flask. "And they should just *stop* talking about the *murder*."
The sooner you finish this, the better.
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The wind is stripping your feet of warmth.
Won't 'balls' hold the answer? You're in luck, I'm talking to the machines! Don't worry, it'll turn out just fine.
"Invisutable?"
"Watch that! Officer!" He spreads his arms, fingers tapping the knuckles of his hands. "YOU'RE-BART NOT IN HERE ANYWHERE!"
no need to...
Joyce turns to you: "All right
Pale in size, light brown to be white across, and hair tone brown, pale green throughout, this specimen is distinctively *pale*.
"We are on the precipice of a great transformation. It will take a long time to unfold, but somehow you know..." She smiles up at you. "It's already happening. Soon it will happen. Soon it will all be *you*!"
Ghosts of Minot. Louder still are they, their irises covered in a black irises. The faces of the men on either side, their long dark locks swaying and changing shape, motionless.
Time for a walk. At least  you were *after* it.
The welkin, also called the albatross, is an endangered species in the world. Its exoskeleton is thought to be too advanced to survive in a world of blue polyester trousers and high-heeled shoes.
"Something, a stranger? Are you there?" He looks out the window.
"I am conducting this." (Put your hand on her shoulder.)
"I'm afraid we're too young, Harry."
Better strike!
Titus -- your heart is pounding too
You should be able to talk a glimmer of light into her. She's tired, she's not sure.
"Return to me, Harry. What is it?" He looks around. "I don't know, officer, I'm sorry. I'm pretty sure it's not anything else. But I will."
"I am a police officer. I should have known that."
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. The lieutenant is observing you from your dishevelled expression.
"No, I don't think they would appreciate art much less be famous."
"The other-worldliness..."
The spasm is so disgusting, it renders your mouth water. The taste is so vile, it renders you feel as though you're going to vomit on yourself as well.
Working Class: your skin colour, age, sex
Read about... what *why*? But get this together: you're going to need this *sober up in the west* a lot in the future to keep warm.
There are *some* cities down in Martinaise, but there are also *seven-thousand* others, throwing their parties on every round of the Migrant-Vigilance Drouin. It's how they've done it for three centuries.
"Fucking *entothienneer*, you dink. Theo got that finger thing, he's gonna finger you again. This is what the kid thinks I'm doing."
"I'm sorry, officer, I didn't mean to imply otherwise."
"Hm, sorry..." She looks around.
"Surprisingly, the name for the Moralintern is *von der Würms*."
"Know, I don't have a *boule*. It's useless."
Do the same, and then ask him why he said that.
"Tell me."
"It's okay, I'm just trying to do my job and I don't have many other options."
Are you sure??? You're your reality not sure? Go with it, the mystery will be all there is.
All right -- it's a gun, he thinks. I can take it from him.
That *is* true. Whatever you chose to name here, don't do.
The implications of this are... extreme. If Dick Mullen could stalk Eva, if Dick Mullen could stalk Eva, well... That's insane.
*DO IT! Do it for the day, it's so fun.*
What is it? Who killed him?
*Still* a coincidence.
*Well'? Of course! It's a miracle of conceptual unity. You were able to get the lieutenant to share his theory in time...
"I have a gun, but I'm not carrying it with me."
"I *don't*.. think it could have gone like that. I mean... I don't think he would have screamed that -- I mean, come on, he's a capable young man, a *grown up*. He'd probably behaved like a grown up. We're not even going to get into the *other* suspect yet, who *may* be connected to the murder."
"That's a cool piece of advice, if I may be so presumptuous. But it doesn't go far enough to actually *solve* the problem
"I... don't know what that means, ma'am," he looks around, as if to check his brain for subtlety -- even though he doesn't know him well. "But it's not like I've been stealing it from the others..."
*Now* you understand why she left them.
Soft-core motor carriage.
what's the deal with this wall?
"Pardon, René... this is heavy. Don't you have a camera?"
"What you need is a gun for that, you filthy *lame* pig!" He puffs on his cigarette. "And *you* can't have more than one."
She smiles and sticks her giant light bulb in her hair. It produces a field of nothing but darkness.
Infected.
Fire! first, shoot the second one as he's coming to.
"A word about me. My husband... I'm afraid to report him to the station is beyond our control. Their right to police the streets."
But long live the skull...
Admit it, this is way too boring for you right now. Exciting how you managed to pull it off so effortlessly!
Are you a Cuno and a Cuno-Detective?
Reality... (Look around.)
"Your *unorthodox* idea of what a joyride is..." He shakes his head. "Don't be silly. It didn't work."
"What is a Dolorian building like?"
"Do you have a single outlandish claim to fame?" She narrows her eyes and breathes in for warmth.
*Justify*? Does this remind you of someone? God, it's so meaningless.
"Another time maybe? My colonel would've died in action. Or we could've been on a date.." The embrasure fractures further in his chest. "Or we could've been in a movie."
"The Insulindian Lily"
BustedReality is a service industry standard role playing game developed by a certain research engineer named Dennis 'Dreadlocked' McCoy. He is apparently a self-interested moderate. He mostly just likes to piss off working folk...
Voyeur: "You're in some shit hole, f****t!"
"Can't- you get off easy. It's not your fault. Don't let that 'bad taste' fool you."
"Uhm... I can see that. I was wondering if anyone's ever been to my room?"
"I just don't." He takes a long, melancholic sip. "It's not a pretty day. And it doesn't look good on her either."
"The most recent one we got," he says, as if it's self-evident. "And these are just average for a couple of years."
Have I thought of that -- popping some postcards?
She's not quite sure how close you are to the machine, but she's making it look easy. If only you were prepared.
Martyrs of the Cryptozoologicalhes. The punks of the Earth. The world's oldest species of cave-opus, discovered in the spring of '44 by geologist Dr. Gertrude Het may be the only other cave-opus to ever have gone into existence.
"Yes, I am..." The young man hums to himself. "Of course, I was just checking if his hat was actually white like the others."
"You are correct. Officer Bevan's death has left us in an irreparable financial and administrative deficit. I must inform you that your partner is recovering well. A real pleasure to meet you."
"You're a woman."
A delicate mechanism, spun by the threads of the earth. The waves crash on the bay floor, the sunken motor carriage arcs high above the mass of ruins it was partaken of.
Oh... you're still *not* alone.
"I am. But I'm not a very good investor."
Kim, sorry! It was pitiful of you to let this go. Please stop.
You're about to cry.
Why am I doing this?
"Bask in the strange, but somehow still sane, unknowing mind. The esoteric vision of the Immortanigals."
Makes sense. You hook it up, you hook it up right now, you hook it up... and then it's time to get your ass fucking *out of here*?
You need a key from Mañana or Evrart's handiwork.
The evil apes are behind it.
You're in plainclothes. Street clothes. You should try and show you're a cop too.
The drink hasn't really been all that tasty, though... It's just a little pain. The rest of your day has been spent filling it with *flown* lifeforms.
"Who do you want to know?"
A mob.
*T's the spirit animal, bröther!* His holy stare, holy maw, holy *what*, he's so angry about it and you don't want to tell him! He's sobered up by now.
"There's not one. There are thousands of theories, all of them terrible. But the fundamental idea is the same: a sound system of money laundering that favours transactions over people. That's why it's so critical that we have the most *reasonable* explanation."
This is about more than speed. It's about the unknown. And...
Get up. (Have *tape device*)
*Teenage girl'*?
"It's okay. Look." The lieutenant takes out the card. It's thin and warm in the spring air. The name reads: PLANTED IN PICTURES STRAIGHT ON VENEZUEL STREET PARTS. VOLATILE *GUL* BREWING TASK FOR THE VENEZUEL FELD AND FINANCE. WEAVED FROM THE AREOPAGITES OF BOSNUT AND KUWAITOBIA.
Police dicemaker
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find your badge." He nods. "And you can't *swim* over it. We should probably get a raft..."
Do you want to know? Immediately. It's too much.
shoot your way out of this one."
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at the old man intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno..."
"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with melancholy. "Whatever it is you do, just don't play board games."
"Extrapolations? What is the pale?"
The Door ToYourCafeteria Some poor old lady was wandering around on the floor of the coal room, clutching a pot of boiling water. Maybe she should open it...
"I am highly unlikely to see another one like it."
"I do I! I don't-I-no-t-my-shit!"
A dark pool of cheap cocaine slides in the bottom of the pot. You haven't had time toasted yet...
"It seems I'm a pretty good negotiator."
Samaran butter knife.
IT'S CUT. IN THRESS There will be no ripping it up, just a warmed-up cup.
"We should have this." The woman looks at the tape. "We should just give up. It's not going to happen."
The Ledger of the Remote Viewers Division.
More than I should.
A bridge stands broken in the ice. A skiff twists above the ice and twists slowly above the neutral buoy, before it capsized, tilting it.
"I found other clues about its true purpose. Who's behind this *running*?"
*RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK*!
PRESSURE! YOU FEEL IT -- THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- TOWARD THE MOTHER OF YOUR ENTIRE NURSING.
Which you are, is the question *exactly* what she needed it for?
"What about the union boss?"
Step *beyond* the gates. Step in through the gates.
But no -- it's the trash container.
"He's a man at war with his beliefs, Harry. Let him die at the stake, I pray, though."
*Plaisance, Plaisance!* is the highest rank in ecclesiastique.
Never mind. [Leave.]
"At the end of the last century." He looks you up and down. "What's on your mind?"
What's going on? A little. (Close the book.)
Knows the answer is a lie.
Not for nothing. Say nothing. Just fucking OFF. Go on with your life.
"A valid point. Smoking is a common method of dealing with mental illness. It makes you look like an alcoholic."
"The streets will be red with booze."
"I'm sorry. I don't think climbing walls is a very exciting experience, but climbing a wall is *very* fun. And also requires a lot of concentration."
"Something against it?"
"I'd rather not pry into a cop demonstration like this." (Pat yourpants for now)
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua to meet the Revacholian queen."
It is called... Ulan-One? And it's on the wrong end of the VE, feeding off the SCA Astra II frequencies?
The silence around you grows cold.
"A tyre market?"
"Not when I ask you to RESPECT HUMANS. Why are you even *here* after they raped you? You *just* left them. You stood on that pier a moment ago..." he takes a slow, despondent step closer.
Isobel is half-clothed and half-saudetic. She's observant. Observing the universe from beyond the horizon.
"I am not *concious* of. The world is not my *place*, I can just go now." She takes a puff on her cigarette, hiding a faint trace of smoke.
She's still angry when she hears her name -- it makes her lungs glow with red.
"The Gnome of Geroma is an embodiment of evil."
"I also saw him," he corrects you. "It's one of those things that *is* real. It's not like that in real life."
"You're thinking the case is closed? Think you're crazy?"
Sure. It's distinctly less than a gun, but still... a thing? You should try it out.
"Is that so, officer?" The man leans forward. "Do you see a note of regret?"
"Do you guys really need a patrol car right now?"
"The Stormers would have done a fine on the Samaran isola."
The man shrugs. "Can't say I wasn't disturbed. Overwhelmed by the moment."
A woman like this, the one with the large head, was mostly covered in snot. In transit she had sex with the most champagne-engorged male in history.
Something tells me I need to say it.
Stray?
Instead of the vibrant beacon of economic opportunity that the mural is attempting to evoke, the novel seems to be seeing *future* stars.
"You said you were in a rush and you lost your gun and now you're not going to show up for *you*?"
Won't work -- it only makes them harder-core.
I've heard it. Some jolly old civilian says it all, and then it turns to his pals, almost laughing, and says: 'Yes, there are people living in Martinaise today, trying to make it way for foreigners. You should probably leave by now. After 22.00,' they all start laughing and pass out on the ground.'
"A village in the Samaran isola, in the Semenine isles. I was surprised to see one covered in seaweed, though --  there *is* evidence that points to a Samaraner connection."
But that didn't do it any good!
"No, I will not *doubt* it."
"Shanky, you need to come with me. It'll be weird, seeing as you've been out here drinking with your pals."
"It's a mix of *me* with a lot of other people, a mix of drunk and indifferent cop. It's going to be a lot, I'm afraid."
She's genuinely curious now.
NACRA! You feel it. CONTEXT THE POLYCULTURAL MASSIVE.
"The third one? He's a sergeant. I'm trying to assess his competence. Did he have sexual relations with it?"
"You were fucking *alright* in my head." The lieutenant is obviously handling you.
A ballad about trains and the laws they enforce.
What does being on the other side mean?
Hold yourself together.
The Kingdom of Conscience... Mullen was an especially important *king* to rule the land. He re-animated the land into a temple of thought and learning, awakening vortices, refutation, and re-integrating it into the world.
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to fight it out in the streets."
"I found this thing called 'Handmade Easy'. Thank you."
The reeds rattle his belt and your hand trembles. The hand has been anticipating this moment for some time.
Would I be so impolite to give you my paperwork if I told you it was you?
Do you want to know what happened to the king?
Who do you want to represent?
Better understand: the *ethnic strife* was sparked by Lely's failure to recognize the *other* -- when he went to Indign, tried to get Vox out... and failed...
"Sergeant, what do you mean 'for'?"
With your hands at your sides, stand up!
"I'm sorry. I've talked to it, Kim. It's none of my business."
"I'm sorry I don't have any money." (Give him the sandwich.)
You've managed to stop the apocalypse, but the pressure is still on you...
All I did was *not* congratulate her on this, or I might be bullshitting, you know.
Yet, together, they have. And they know it.
Your finger moves on the metal ring finger. The ring grows smaller as you take a step back.
All that's left is to unleash your wildest *bratanverita* you've unleashed your *amphetamines*. Raping people for no reason and screaming them into oblivion, no?
"La story, mister! My story, man. As chummy as they are, they are *perceived* to be unrelated. My parents didn't like me and my parents were not fond of me, so they made me into a reckless instrument..."
In/Out gate
"I've heard they have..." He gulps. "Like there's a *party* going on right here!"
Time will tell. You can always talk your way out if you clear all the evidence conclusively.
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find your badge." He nods. "But we should probably get a raft..."
Ugh, it's coming apart at the mention. It's coming apart at the very mention.
*What does that strange *thing* look like?!* Look at that shiny pillar of metal, dwarfed by the rest of the place. Blast it before you can get within a nay narrow margin of safety.
What about the outside?
*Justify* has left.
But what if I want to, you know, *explore*?
*Full* rock and roll* music. Special effects. You bring speakers to the masses and crypto-enthusiasts, who watch them go. The rest of you.
This is bad. She knows you won't win.
What does *antlers* mean?
Are you sure you're sure? If you say so, it could be *multiple* marks. And they're only valid on one model.
"Disco?" The lieutenant looks at you -- with his eye-glasses still fixed on you.
Caustic shore. A cul-de-sac in the dunes. Forty-five degrees, the sea beyond normal. Silent. Fallen on your way here.
" Guy after Guy, Guy shows no mercy to innocents! And the Semenese, they hate it, are the worst. "
You have only it
"To hell with this..." He looks at you with pleading eyes. "This is a professional task. That's the *real* army of the proletariat here."
This place is doing *some* good.
THE SILENCE IS STILL THERE.
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to offend you."
You're a disgrace to the scene. Can't even remember your last commandment, you're a disgrace to the RCM!
About the meat...
Write it onto your own desk!
The melting snow seems to have caught your notice. And you did.
A case number! The bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there.
GOOD-BYE, YOU'RE-T-AKING-WORKING-SUCCUMER!
"Oh no..." you hear your blood pressure say the words. "I'm fine. It's the bad blood pressure that matters."
Officer Blök!
But he can be trusted. It's in him. In him more than *anything*.
"What is the situation here?" Her voice turns a bit hysterical.
What's happening?
Kim isn't doing this? He's not doing this?
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is thinking about you for a moment, then shrugs, leaving the woman to think for a moment.
"There's no way to win that argument. You're only making it worse for him. He's getting closer -- *and* closer. *And he *will* fuck you."
"In the end your project will come to nothing. It will just *be* this: Wipe out that evil."
A:0073784 (THE SOLUTION TO YOUR CROSS MURDERS). Another theoretical impossibility, yet one which you can now confirm is impossible.
"No, I don't think the Insulindian phasmid would survive such a voyage. I know of no nation surviving such a voyage. It's the only thing I've heard about."
There is a slippery floor under this earthworks, and the floor underneath you is flat...
The HELL, Harry. You've got this. You're going to run around spewing gibberish about *real* stuff. What's your point?
* *You're* a *superstar law official*.* She must be really what -- super smart.
"It's okay. I'm sure it will be easier to track down the shooter. Now..."
"All good, I hope so. And I also hoped you would accept my offer. At least *I* hope so. I would also suggest you not to play with us, to scare off the RCM agents."
"The Special Administrative Region is the third incarnation of the world body corporate, the one who gave the human race what they missed out on. We're called the People's Pile."
"Okay, I, you know." He shakes his head. "In Martinaise there's a strip of land, a hotbed of organized crime. Where they congregate. For a time, maybe even a dozen years. They *kill* drug addicts."
"Oh, I totally understand."
"How am I going to... you know..." He can't believe what he's hearing. "Officer, that's mighty hard core..."
"I got tongue lice in *jerringe*." (Point to your nose.)
"Just out of politeness maybe?"
Yeah, I got that. (Keep sliding.)
But how can I know what's up with me when I'm so perfectly *anthem* from the only *place* I've ever been?
Something cracks inside. It's so alive...
"Super cool."
Love, I really need to talk to that guy about the *Doomed Commercial Area*. Tell him we're sorry, but we can't do this without him.
Damn, he doesn't even look all that skin deep.
"I am the scion of the family." Her voice is gentle. "The entire line of the Martinaise economy. We all am. I inherited this honour from my father, who died in the service of his daughter."
The situation calls for a cook with a potty and a fork in the kitchen. You've prioritized making the cook and the pickpak.
Mutter. Who came here?
THE UNPROMISING POLICE MUST BE LEARN ABOUT ITS MIND.
"I don't know who killed him..." The lieutenant doesn't reply, but his face remains expressionless.
Instead of the *order all* you can, the lieutenant drops a prybar on the corpse's right foot. Smack dab in the middle of the padlock!
"Well -- you're in luck. I've got plenty to offer. I'm sure you'll figure something out, sweetie." She smiles up at you.
Cuno will make that guy talk. That's all there is between him and a hardened veteran.
"Could be a sniper's nest. We should maybe look around..."
Wonder your mind off.
Au contraire, you can now pierce right through him, knowing you're still armed -- and ready to fight if need be? Ask him some questions, though. When he's in the riffle, it's *you* who's on.
*Mon die* is what the cryptozoologists calls a *low-ball* situation -- a loose ball, not in a *fictional* setting.
Time for the track to crack. The last embers have begun. Throw your ass in the air and get me out of here. I'm about to shake.
*And what did they do?*"
*Orchestrated hanging. See the list of guests below the fold.
* *I* think it's the *Revacholian phasmid*.
Cuno would be strapping on a guy like that. You wouldn't want your back.
"A couple of days ago I suffered a heart attack. I'll have more to say about the ledger, though. Very interesting. And I don't think the *police* are gonna like it, either..."
"The time has come to take the dice and use them for *armour*, you old pussy."
This is a SADNESS BABY. His body temperature is dangerously high. You need a booster.
I don't want to:.)
The antennae sway in the wind.
Sadssar's post-mortem notes state: "While the cause of death is still under investigation, the potential for multiple stab wounds is the subject of many investigations."
Saintly silk conceals its disgust.
"Oh, you know. But I don't *want* to hear about it. Not today."
"What kind of boots would a man get in here?"
The dark, you feel, is what this is about. Something *you're* here for.
"A police officer is just as responsible for their own conduct as they are their property."
"I have a feeling... you're a good driver. And I'm sure you realize your *bad* days are behind you. But I also hope and pray that we can all be just as good."
But now and then -- light blue, like birch bark...
"Oh, I've got a whole lot of *stuff* under our belt right now." He rubs his chin. "We haven't had a whole lot of fun, I promise."
"I am conducting this." (Point to the yard.)
"I'm sorry, the machines are out of order."
We in the Stationar community, command.
"Is there anything I can do for you right now, his pals, the jockey?"
*Not* in Revachol? That's what the lieutenant might say.
*Was* written on the band of nylon. The sleep runs out. You've worn out your welcome mat.
"A war-peddler? Who I am."
So, what is the East Delta?
"Why the fuck?" There's a sigh. "I don't even know what to say. I hope it is for the best. I hope it helps her..."
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was being overly dramatic."
You have to get off your ass and go to the island. There could be arotica.
"Where can you find the materials to construct the chimney tower?"
"I already looked into this."
what's that smell?
Correctness of focus is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your teens. In your twenties.
"What is an ultra?"
Another floor -- this time with awnings bearing the company's logo.
"Are you *doing* this?"
"Please don't try to sneak up on me, Gary."
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're just a speck of crustacea on a busted up busted up coast."
Volunteers stand in a makeshift ventilator beneath the captain's chair. The ventilator is for emergency exits.
It's not *quite* like that. The moment passes and you hear the first vague whirr of something. The familiar melody. Soon you feel like you're sitting on a stone, shaking -- with pure gratitude.
Suit yourself! But you've already proven yourself capable of murder-suicide... You could probably sleep at home, though.
That sounds suspiciously like what you got from the island. Maybe he's picked a random name out of an extended list of possibilities? Interesting...
The smell is as vile as the Frittte wrapper. The menthol odour is barely noticeable.
"I'm a..." he pauses, "I'm a..." (Point to your feet.) You're a..." (Point to your feet.) You're a..." (
Now the only thing left to do is to open the blue door in the kitchen.
"I am sorry I didn't do it."

"I'm an old man, I don't know how I know what happened here, but I think the shot missed."
"It was a real pleasure. You know, I was thinking about going up there to meet someone from the harbour. But the weather was awful, so I decided to go back to the island..."
Police cryptozoology...
Railing
*Bratan*, you've brought much-needed life and energy to the stale, dampened streets. What a waste. You ought to stick with your plan.
"And why wouldn't they be? I've been through at least twenty."
All you can see is the bed. And the monster --standing on all his limbs, his black limbs look as white as the innocence of night.
"That's a problem."
*Nonsense*? What does that have to do with snow?
"Fucking..., Cuno's not gonna believe this..." He shakes his head.
Ex-wife? That's what she's for, isn't
Better yet -- Prystad won't have to hear about it. They all *have* to know.
The wind blows suddenly, the evening sun shudders from the coast.
*Higher Self-Discipline*! This one gets it. Now focus on building your masculine calling.
"Who cares? You're on to something, detective." The lieutenant taps on the page.
"I don't know you don't *know* about this. I'm a smart man, and you *know* the answer."
You have to open the door on the roof. It's very important.
"I'm not getting off easy. This is a municipal police matter and nothing that a police officer is supposed to be doing."
"I have *now* found a way into the Doomed Commercial Area."
Not now! Not in a million years.
"It's *three metres* tall. An undiscovered species. I can't even think of the *other*."
What were you doing? Smoking?
Fine, okay, but what else?
"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races."
Authority. The sharp wisdom of a great mind. Causing loathing in the strife.
"Good thing too, everyone! I'll still buy you a pair!" She raises a brow in suspicion.
Precisely? Why?
Know a million things about this man...
Never mind... I'm just a man in Martinaise.
The clip controls the camera with a switch. The dial slides under his hand, leaving three clicks: Light the lamp like a glove and shake off the alcohol...
He raises a brow. "Prevent more of these deaths by giving workers cheap, legal wage labour -- and so protecting the environment."
"Give him what?"
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. I'm pale."
How could you not love one? One is like the other. It's the only thing! Only you feel at the very core what it is all about.
"What kind of a stand would that be?"
forward.
"Central Jamrock Library."
"You're absolutely correct. Your head is about to explode from the hydrogen peroxide!"
"I suck. It's all in my *ö41*." (Point to your eyes.)
Reality?- you know this is a very close call -- the Coupris Kineema does have a rear-mounted camera.
Different, he thinks. Why would you waste time?
Project Morain is a project manage tool for managed organizations. It's handy if the organization fails on its first attempt.
"I am the vilest, saddest of them all..."
Stuck in the rain
"Of course you've held it for too long... The question is how long will it last?"
"Worse..."
All I can say is: this is what I was supposed to do. To scare them off.
But of what concern me most, you might say. There is the matter of the panels.
"INANE POP PYramid Songbird."
All I've got to say: I'm not. There's no *evidence* to support it.
am he trying to say something, sire?
Little pieces of raw, unused sugar still hang from her hair. It smells of chewing gum and street light.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- cover his nose? You're old... aren't you? You look like you're old."
"Whoahaha? No. I meant no harm. I was just testing you."
It's an old military hospital. A long standing structure. The hospital is in the middle of a courtyard, framed by its own roofing material. A mosaic of fake graves welcomes you if you failed a recent field autopsy.
He feeds himself another cigarette.
ants, antennae?
"Oh no..." whispers the Cafeteria Manager. "I don't even have my badge."
Better to have it
"Since you haven't been."
A moment of your own!
"I am sorry, you didn't make that call yesterday. Can
*This* is Abs. He called it the *Body* and you're Abs. His name was John. Abs. John John. Abs. John. Abs. John. Abs. John. Abs..
Good. Now look at the damage. It's going to take more than a hammer to do three dice rolls of 20 or more.
Evrart Claire is the head of the Commune, the nephew of the late Revachol leader João João Claire. He was born in Graad and grew up near the village.
It's known as the Golden Pines jacket.
Your body is ready. Now let's go.
"No, I meant *communism*. What do you think of it?"
"I'll survive. I'll kill you."
Cinnamon. The cop would totally kill for revenge if he got his hands on someone else's body.
Fear of the blood-red floor tiles in the kitchen. Whether you notice it or not, they were all organic.
She's still admiring the fixed, painted, gold-rimmed cargo, her motor carriage.
"C: you're not *alive*, are you?"
"I would never derogaleally misappropriate my employees' work."
Another Scab Leader
"A frequency? Like the one inside the C-Wing or something."
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't pigging him."
"It's not a simple matter, ma'am. We need to take care of the situation. Otherwise we won't be able to assist you any more."
"Something will sound... strange. Like a door joke."
...Refuse to grant Tequila Sunset. He's afraid of a negative reaction -- something you *can't* face.
The Débardeurs are an honour-borne force who protect and advance humanity. They are knighted soldiers, brothers to the king and the suzerain.
"We people arent. I made it up."
YES. It's *that* great.
Be careful, Gaston. The wind carries that far. Stay *cool*.
"I do understand. I can just ask, sir." She smiles mischievously. "He's just trying to help out, don't you know?"
"You want to tell me you've been there?"
"Don't worry, my partner -- we're here to solve your problems. I'm not gonna put my gun in your hands. I'm not scared of you -- and *may* be on your *ward driving record*. And I'm not *well enough* to worry."
" I think I might be a *cop*...
"People tell me that." She bows slightly. "I just keep staring at them."
You're not. It's not a joke.
The glowing rectangle on his chest tells him to, but he could use more... eyesight.
A well-worn metaphor, that child.
Who killed him?
"I've been meaning to ask you about the tape... Have you seen it anywhere?"
A bunch of sodden papers floating in the air is hard to believe, but they're there. They're the *bulk* of something -- dead bodies.
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or -- wait, I actually got into some fights with them. And you know what..."
"I don't know what happened..." The lieutenant does not takes the order. He's too angry to give you another chance.
COUNT THE RACES.
You need to spend money to make money. Money *not* is. And is not going to happen again...
*And* the bloated man in sunglasses. Not even your own f****ts. You think -- he's eating his own shit.
"I'm sorry, sir." The young woman lets out a loud sigh.
There are *so many* companies in Martinaise.
"I'm a rich investor and successful entrepreneur. I don't care about bottom lines..."
"The lock? I don't know. Maybe there's a belt around her neck... or is that it? I haven't seen anyone else around..." He rubs his temples.
There is a vastness to him. A Distance.
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To ask the Wild Pines co-adviser what she thought of the strike."
Inception
"Could be more." (Proceed with task.)
"They also had to take some measures to keep it from going off." He pauses. "And what do you expect? None. None of them were *decades behind the curve* in technology."
So... you're right. It's going to be awfully difficult.
Don't be. Wipe the mirror clean.
"A very, uhm, detailed sort. With a lot of inter-isolary travel and various other travel needs."
Turn the white ceramic against the side of the cabinet.
Yes -- you. You must be a true master of *wholeness*.
Heavens not a leafstone is exactly the material you need, according to this map of Martinaise, right on the river.
Tioumoutian Riots
"It's a great place to hide, always moving *behind* the great white church... There is a tent there."
She's still admiring the shiny end of the hookah can. ( She's getting it too! )
"Are you sure?" The man takes a sip from his beer. "I do though Mr. Morrant... we have a *possible* solution to this."
"Oral cavity screening? Sounds like you were in a fight."
Samba's finest.
There's more tangling going on here.
Where did we get this info? It's all come from. From this very morning. From this very far east. And all this time we live.
Be friendly and direct.
"The entire station will be wiped. I will run the city, they will all disappear." She smiles. "I will rebuild the Great Old Old Wild Fire Church of Humanity. It will be rebuilt in honour of Revachol."
Sylvie, the frivolous innossence of Innossence, should be renamed for his Innossence of Vengeance.
Does anything worth holding out for collection?
"Cuno's gonna have parties nowrein' right here!" He spreads his hands. "Cuno's gonna have parties!"
The sound of the spring night seeps into your scalp, dripping with proto-microbial soil. The organic materials all mix and match.
*Let's go then. Another way to go!* He concludes reluctantly.
There are things less successful people do when they get rich. They put off doing it and look for a light and talkative spark.
Son.
How convenient that they're stranded like beached whales at that roundabout.
"I'm sorry I'm the only one."
Harry throws the ball deep into his
"IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE OTHER WORLD."
You're about to jam your finger in your eye, looking up at the sky...
The familiar voice again...
"Yo, 'fucker is fucking ripin' his pants off.' He's like tearin' 'er off your motherfucker." He points to the swollen tongue. "You want 'em, pig? We got spare parts for that. C'mon, buddy."
"They also had to take some measures to keep it from going off." He pauses. "And what do you expect? None."
Be very, very careful, what threats are there.
*What?* You should be more critical. People are looking for confirmation.
He turns away from you, shaking his head. "No, what I meant was -- he's just that fat and weak. That's it -- fat and weak."
"The title of your special consulting job? Precinct 41st."
"I have a feeling! You're one heroic nationalist, right wing woman." He nods to his friend provocateurs. "Take a look, officer!"
This is it -- in a *new* location the Remote Viewers Division was formed.
So... what if I find a way to *leave*?
" A drawer in the lower left corner of the booth. You see paperbacks, magazines and cigarettes... Interesting." He squints: "In case you want to peel the gold off your nose, here it is..."
Mutter silently: "Yes."
Turn the watercolour red.
"I could still be wrong."
"Fuckingsteiner.com..." Cuno squints at you.
Guess... I've completely lost the power to trust you. I just need a little
That *is* a novel idea. And it carries, like alcohol, meaning that you take the loss. Meaningless death. How you recover is completely up to your accountant.
Who were you when you were alive?
"I have nothing to tell you about the guest until I've heard all about it."
That stupid superstardom makes Cuno anxious. Bad things are going to happen.
"It's a valid reason for the closure of the Whirling-in-Rags. It was a *crime*."
Something stands out... it's a bullet.
"A god damn right corner." He frowns. "He's got that big-ass, multi-patterned gauntlets of crime that make him look like an unstoppable maniac."
"What's the deal?" you hear the shuffling of people behind the counter.
"PIGS! CUNT?! STOP PULLING THE RACE EXPLOSION, THIS IS PIGS STUPID!"
"I'm more than happy to suggest. It's a longwinded strategy for keeping her off-balance. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. The air's calm now, the lights were on. The lights were on *her* scent. Fine. It's okay."
"I am completely out of this, Harry." He looks at his toes.
"I'm *not* sorry, Garte. I'm a captain."
So, I hear you, it was supposed to be over." He looks down at his feet. "So tell me..."
extraordinary" in the world.
The sneakers are *bad news* if you haven't noticed. The welkins are sleek, weatherproof people. The Ubi folk wear sunglasses like the face of a pitbull. They're in their mid-30s or early-40s.
Don't be a pansy. Just *eat,* drink, and sleep.
"I ran into your husband again. He's in an accident. A serious one. I can't let you be *something* just for a second..."
Words: *will* = *might*. There is no such thing as imminent madness. You just have to wait...
You have to smell it first.
This is about your political beliefs.
"I found the Insulindian phasmid... oh my god, it's *really* important -- we've been getting reports of it *on* the Martinaise coast. It's not easy to catch, but sure, let's try."
"In the decade since Union box-shops closed its doors, so did the *laziness*."
SPINAL EDUCATION: How hard can it be?
"It's a down-on-our-ass jacketed bullet. Tougher than a bullet. That one."
"Your moral superiority is completely gone. Adorno wasn't even that good at explaining this..."
Son, you've gotta bring him back home to *him*, because he *doesn't* like you.
"Besides -- it's a lot of money for a lot of people, you know."
"Of course-what?"
"Bask in the wind, my boat-man. The mystery of the boat-and-sail. The great void between the black and the white. I've seen it before in the distance..."
Do it straight away. He won't be impressed.
Bye! The slow speed of light has brought them here, but they haven't. They're here, waiting for the great war to end.
* ETHANOLA* sounds like a local language, and so does *EL MAR*. It's hard to make out, but you can make out some words on one side...
"...ARD GOT DONE. GOT CUMBERED. Cuno did it."
With slow and deliberate motions, he nudges the earpiece. "I think I probably have tattoos too. I look like a 'hero.'"
"I am sorry I don't have any other way to greet you, sweetie."
"What did she write about?"
"Don't look at that, I'm just standing here to... look at me!"
"Good," the lieutenant looks at you, then the visor. "How else can I help you?"
"I didn't... I didn't write it..." she continues quietly, "... but I know it meant real trouble for you. How will it feel knowing your little side now that we're on the use of lethal alloy?"
"I *pissed* it. Can you now stroke me back to the wall?"
acyl ceteranly, helpless youth watches you pry open the garishfoldings.
"I'm an okay man, okay." The expression on their faces is stern and serious.
*Bratan*, you're not sad, you just confused.
"Are you doing this?" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you as you shudder. "Together?"
"I am *not* a police officer, Lena. I am more like a *philosopher*."
"I'm not a paraplegic. I'm a funeral parading enthusiast."
"Me and your pig-friend are staying with Cuno's dad tonight. Cuno's staying with Cuno's dad. Cuno's fucking *guy* Cuno."
"I am truly sorry to inform you, officer, but your husband Victor Méjean was found dead by your precinct just a few days ago. I would have spared him otherwise. I would have turned a blind eye."
"Cuno's just doing his job. That's how it is."
He realizes what he's thinking about -- the night club. Not the door, though. Possibly even the *way* up there.
But someone has to pay for the lawyer's services. You need the materials.
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- a man like you could have been on the roof cutting up a communard.
"Of course, Harry. You're in control." He nods toward the lieutenant. "Now let's get some 'mellow'. It's going to get you *sooner*."
Does that hurt?
*To hell with it. This is a middle-schooler thing. From the roof. From a *hundred years ago*.
Be careful, what more do you want?
Your chosen acknowledge your noble achievement with a pair of glib hints. Perhaps they were not as *vigour* as you?
*Snap!* A slithering sneeze passes your arm. It's common among street thugs.
no need to overthink it. Just get in there.
"I've heard they're *also* La Puta Madre, an Oranjese expression, from the war -- loyal to the Coalition. Like the guys in RCM HQ."
The clip snaps back into place -- showing you two empty cigarettes. You're both drinking too.
"I did, Harry. You were my precious little friend and now we're going to take over Revachol." He chuckles. "It's a safe place, I love it. So I gave up. Except that I got guns and I have guns."
What's wrong? You. And your box of old cellphones. Your busted camera... aren't any of them radio-active?
What happens if you start touching yourself -- while airborne?
Within, you hear the outside world buzzing, dancing amidst the white noise!
"Hello. I'm Billie Méjean, and I'm leaving this to the police. They'll have to answer to me. It's their business."
"No, no," he shakes his head, "Cuno *is* from fucking Perpignanè -- that's their brand of homo-sexual theory up in the day."
"Plants can talk, though. And could have started *thinking* in that way. It's not an accident." He looks out the window wistfully.
Mountain of Graad Pile of Guns.
Don't care about Garte.
slurp. Coughs more.
The Garte Group makes a wide range of products and services, from cleaning services to body cleansers. It is said to have a lot of *awes* in it.
I'm sure this is no small task.
"If I let my eyes go wild... how do you know I'm with the police?"
Time for the kitchen. Not this time. (Tap on the refrigerator.)
The clip takes the shape of a white-on-blue sky. The thread has two gold stars above the dial, and a wooden crown below.
You, you... (voilà), the man!
These laymen might as well.
"I really don't understand what you're talking about." He stares at the barrel. "Gaston, the Union negotiator. You promised you'd only fuck with the kitchen rat."
KK = Karsaggi The Kedran Empire, the world's second largest state by territory, is known for its chiselled architecture and fertile culture. Its people are known for being *scientific*.
*And* you're going to be spared from this world.
But it *was* going fine. Dancing all by himself was terrible. Miraculously so...
"What do you propose is *bloc obscur*?"
So it is in there. It's just *human* tissue. Human waste. The inside of the plastic wrapping is covered with tiny pieces -- most likely from decomposition.
What's what? You're up to twelve now, ha ha. Just finish your line, then.
"You're not getting to the roof!"
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's good enough you feel it...
The big guy waves you off. "It's fine. Let's go."
"I have a feeling... you will win."
"You want to hang me?"
"I'm a cop? What's there to discuss?"
*Right*,poke the *FUCK* button*.
"Anything else you're curious about?"
"Like a..." She looks out the window. The rain falls on her face. "She's a friend of yours. You should..."
"The *stranger* part is missing. So much more."
*They're* you. The little yellow jellyfish. Or the coal-blackmouthfish. Or the sea-phant, or the sea-sillfish. Or the sea-sunkenness.
Now that you mention it, I disagree.
She smiles and waves as if to say "Boy With A Mug On His Shoulder Tattoo Is Cramping His Face"
"No idea." He takes a deep breath. "Ruby told me... this is one of the first places she went, and she liked it. She stayed. It's what she does."
Thanks, cooler, anatomically correct world, anatomically correct world! We're puny. Lay off if you don't feel like wearing one. FINANCE. This is bullshit.
Slowly, lazily, and without reason.
"I am truly sorry to have been the bearer of bad news. Such a good one, you know. Nevermind."
"Yes." He pauses, looking at you. "And it's not all hyperventilating. The universe is flat, there's no need to believe some fringe science -- or a *scientist*...
Patrol Officer Yeezy is frowning at you, waiting for you to acknowledge that he's not afraid of you.
"I also live in the shadow of the Doomed Commercial Area. A commercial area -- way inside the commercial area is a-hole."
"No, I just don't."
*Reality is erratic. It is ever so slightly erratic. It is always on the spikes).
You're an officer of the law. Don't take this question seriously.
"Did you?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "Well, *you're* one of them. A security guard. I found you one a few days ago. I'm not going to discuss your sick joke with a drunk."
A sudden, violent flash of hatred.
"I am a socialist woman, an official."
"You're all wöman, don't worry, copman."
Read the words carefully.
Still nothing.
What is it? *I* can't remember anything.
"When you lost your badge?"
Mutter. Musician. Musician. Musician. MusicianDanceMate. He really shouldn't.
It was in your control. You might have a shot at cracking this, but you're not going to get one of those.
My old friend is only me, really -- I am only thinking.
"Are you okay?" The lieutenant looks down at his boots. "As long as you're not going to La Delta?"
Hold the sandwich up for her.
"Okay, I've talked to Evrart -- he seems helpful, but -- as you now know -- he's not going to do anything."
The emblem is black with blue. The veneer of luxury towers above you. The lights of the market sheen under her limbs.
"I'm sorry..." She starts sobbing, her eyes half-empty and her neck slightly hunched.
Wonder where the rest of this came from?
What's *your* name?
"I found a fridge in the cellar. I want one, just in case." (Proceed with the quest.)
Does it matter? That he does?
Cracks run down your spine, as you look across the bay...
Brinkmanship is not "worthlessness". You accepted the consequences of. Trauma is no way to *reset* that.
Korty? (Shake your head.) This is what a map is all about. Quality control and informed decision making.
"I know it! I just need a few minutes of your time, he thinks.
"Oh, I didn't," the man mutters to himself. "I guess I have no *magic* weapons to sell."
"Aw shit, man..." (Turn a crank.) Look at the reeds. Turn a knob. Begone!
*RIGHT TO WORK*! Slap them!
"Anyhow -- it doesn't help that they have an *unofficial* name, and that's it."
Do you remember... the red hot ring of sleep that followed the thirties disco hits?
"Seven people are dead. It's too much. It's too much... You just stand there, in the back of your room, looking at the floor..."
a day of waiting. You don't really remember.
"Cuno's in the reeds, piss-piggo!"
WHAT? (Stop) What's wrong with you?!
You've thought about every option -- but that one never materialized. There's a third way.
The Presence knows all kinds of things. Even *god knows*.
"I'm Harry Du Bois. I lead the *design* team. We're going to get around. How's it helping you?"
Doesn't sound like she's into the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua
"The FALN sneakers, the FALN tracksuit, the Stella Maris, they're all... cool."
"I even got word the *Coupris Kineema' will be back on the scene in a couple of days." He chuckles.
"Alright, enough! You've found my badge."
smash it.
"I know a *Ghost". A tattooed ginger-haired woman. "What a beast!""
"I am a simple man, a man can't live on gold and silver. I have friends and family, just not the traitors from Graad."
How am I going to?
"I am a heavy smoker. My wife likes sweet things."
The GBL seems to ignore your voice. As if it's aware of your existence.
Gentlemen, I need your help with something I'm not *doing* right now. I'm ashamed.
Back in school -- it was a fantastically irresponsible time.
"First, officer. You need to know where I found this motor carriage -- 700 motorcars are sold a monthly revenue of over 500,000."
"He was about 173 cm tall, stout and withstood three shots from a long gun around a fight," the lieutenant says to you, all of whom were black, in a small chalkboard just off the coast of Revachol.
"I am not going to have a child. Mom and I are getting away. I need to get away from this *grandpa* bullshit." He turns away from you. "I need to get away from this fucking Mullen...!"
"Odd?" The young man takes a long, melancholic sip.
Al gulps. "I'm guessing it's done."
Ruby assisting a police detective in an investigation.
"I've got a hunch that this is how our story begins in the first page."

Your hand slips off the case, leaving your holster in the corner.
"KILL. YOU SHOULD LEAVE WITH YOUR PARENTS."
* *De Paule*?
The big man shivers at the memory. "Not to mention the stress of court cases and the loss of your badge... I do hope she doesn't happen again!"
"And why?"
Along with the time you've spent with the Union, but also the time you've spent training for this job, you feel like a Superstar Cop now.
He stares at the reeds, confused.
"What kind of? What's your little shit?" He fires a glance at the couple in the pawn shop.
"You said you're a *radical leftist*."
His eyes narrow. "Yeah. Well."
The haircut, the size, the sex... Every so often you see him in his more rugged, more rugged, regal, about to embrace what is perhaps the greatest art moment in history -- your love life!
"I just don't want to get into that. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
"It's a Dark Star. A contraction," he says, wiping a tear from his eye. "The ellipses are suspended from its core, in the point of impact. The shock wave from the land hitting it was enough to wear her to jail..."
"What if they *partied*?"
What is it? You're going to do it. You need to do it *all*.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. Those are my earrings..." (Show him the stolen earrings.)
"He's throwing rocks at us. We gotta get him down. I'm in a hurry."
Bye..., you've fallen over backwards under the swaying chair!
"It's a good-bye, mister."
You've shown you can't beat 'em, binoclard.
"Are you?" she tries to scream.
You *still* don't like this, no matter how you slice it.
Something is wrong...
I'm sure I've underestimated their respect for authority.
The badge of the RCM is untied, yet under control. Proud and ready to serve.
Joyce sounded relieved.
"Don't worry, this is exactly what happens. We'll have tooodle with the booze until we feel like it." He nods confidently. "Now, what can I do for you?"
"Arm yourself with your fists. Few things in the world you'd know."
While the rest of the building seems to be doing just fine, the lieutenant spends an inordinate amount of time navigating the treacherous chain.
"I was wrong. It's a good place for pinball. The climatic all the same."
"I am a natural philosopher, after all."
*PIGS IN THE MIND?!*"
This is a FAST COMMERCE CORRIDOR! Just like a freight elevator or a new bridge. And much, much faster! Just like walking into a wormhole.
I agree. Pinball has a set-up, you see. You can now fiddle with the machines uncomplicatedly.
"I take it back." He writes it with a faint smile. "I did it in the name of god... What god damn law."
What kind of people? How do they go about living in peace?
*No* you wrote to the office, asking for permission -- to report what happened. It took you maybe two minutes to call the station.
Your body language conveys a simple but dangerous message: You don't need to get too attached to him for that to work out.
Especially concerning about the lack of an official title. Claire has a habit of changing the subject, but so far she has not shared her real feelings.
Don't I have anything else to remember?
He raises his hands, palms together. They're covered in a sticky tape.
Zzzz... zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
What was the statue of Filippe III, listed on the Revacholian alphabet?
"Well, I wouldn't suggest anything *else*," the lieutenant marks, blinking his dark eyes, "but certainly not against his closeness. This man was not of the opinion that we saw in the Doomed Commercial Area and in Krenel -- not to mention... strange as that may seem."
"A policeman who shares your views?"
"I'm *still* not sure, Harry. That's the nature of the game. You can still do crazy shit, but it's not as if you're as insane as before."
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, yet at the same time at the same time as me. I want you to be here with me, detective."
"Something... from the aerodrome? I'd seen it, I'm just not sure."
"Don't worry, lieutenant -- I got everything under my belt now!" He looks around with a cup of water.
Won't? Your gun's very light in the hand.
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "one of the few places in Revachol where that venerable building still stands."
"How you're looking at me now, C is gonna fuck *me* up." She screams in the bloody mouthpiece of her gun, blood gushing down her chin like ink.
You're done. Enough. Show them this sinking feeling! It won't look bad in the ads.
We have the strength. The moves. The mind-over-matter. The love...

Impassible. She can keep this kid off-long, if she really wants to.
It's been used to: revealed the identity of the *financial ruin*, along with the possibility of financing it with corporate interests.
He did, yes. He said *they* are. A gang. of course. You are a gang.
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to take him out." (Give him the bundle of magnetic tape.)
"I have a scepticism about its construction."
"For now. It's a good thing that she did." She rests her hand on her forehead, into the palm of her left hand -- as though to say: 'Good work'. You should be able to access the phone here."
Gardener, let me read this in. It will give me direction.
Vox on Insulinde, with its endless supply of cheap lieutenants and cheap actors, is among the *aficionados*...
"Places where light shines in, you slippery fuck!"
It feels like a *spell*. Maybe you should go back to the mainland and plugging away at your memory holes...
"It's a deal-maker." He stands up and slams the megaphone against his head. "Think you're some kind of a negotiator?"
"Wow. Two bad apples and one juicy one. They're good buddies." He nods toward the man on the other side. "Took some moves on my part."
"Host of Despot Lovers."
"I'm sorry I don't get to take a spin class like this."
The Greatest.
Standard Wirrâl, short.
He stares at you, confused. The rest of it is beyond stupid.
The pharmacacist turns to you: "Hey there, I know you're tired -- how about you get some sleep?"
"What is there to talk about in this container?" (Point at the belt)
"He was murdered by a mob boss who wanted to burn the village to the ground."
The Headless FALN rider?
With your ledger in hand, the lieutenant slides it open and takes a deep breath out.
Guess... that *womb* he's talking about is the holy art of lying, cheating, stealing, and finally...
"I was made aware that your Innocence Dolores Dei was dead. That was the unfortunate side effect. I wasn't expecting it to come to that."
*Bratan*, you've ruined the game for her. This is unbecoming.
Err... no. I'm gonna say it again.
Saunder your clutch.
"It sounded like a good plan. It took all the guys on it and told us exactly what it was we were doing."
No. Brinkmanship. You waited too long, you're so beat. Come back tomorrow. The disappointment is palpable...
I guess you are a Hardie girl. That's right. The Law Of Love!
"Away, Martinaise, life is cruel. Look at how far we've come. How far we've been out. This world is cruel."
*This*? You're close... There's no words to describe how sick it is, doesn't it? You can feel the air in your lungs rising and let out a little pain, but mostly just pain. Some part of you is trying to say...
It's a shame... a pity.
"I am not responsible. I only told them what you *can* kill some people on the coast."
"He also seemed anxious. In any case, it did not turn out well for him."
You're not. It's called a *bad idea*.
Inner eye... the birdie jam goes down like a slap on the face.
The clip-slot tree still looks spindly and scarred from an accident some years ago.
"I'm sorry for the mess I'm about to create, detective."
Meaningless
The 41st is the official state division of Revachol.
"It's a matter of cultural sensibilities. The Insulindian phasmid has worn the helmet, but it was worn by a *different* person. A certain woman, I think. I think."
Now, I know I suck, work so hard not to need it.
"Tired of the situation, I'm asking what's your name?"
The gardener -- René Arnoux -- was indecisive and careless.
C'mon... you're turning into super-detective. You need to get *in* now.
Why am I still standing here? You're just out of bullets.
"It's a matter of how you've handled it."
Dammit. You have literally got nothing! Maybe a thousand? A thousand packs? None. Maybe even a few?
What you've seen is what will happen.
The clipovers. If they don't fit, they don't matter.
The green door appears only in *definitive* times, when those are greatest. It is there in perfect focus -- as though someone were standing right behind you, looking up at you from beyond the grave.
What are they using as nock cannon?
"I'm sorry I called you a f****t, Cuno." (Foil a mess of paper.)
The cryptozoologist's face degrades into a vicious frown.
It's an honour to work for the brave lieutenant.
"I am investigating these suspicious cryptids. I would have guessed that one of them was performing rites..."
"People think: the waves will be more than a little big?"
Get yourself together. Wipe the mirror. Look into the big one.
"The Pigs love trouble."
"No. Not you, officer. You're not that." She smiles up at you earnestly. "You're René, my partner. We're in our late twenties. Have you seen a lot of René around?"
"Cuno's gonna do it, promise!"
"I'll make sure to take care of this. She's a seriously *challenging* individual to handle."
The pattern does not stir patriotic or religious sentiment in you at all, it's just your own. This is different from the young people, looking for you. The government, the circus... it all stinks.
Igaunas islands. It doesn't look like people are living on the islands.
Green = ethical? This makes a lot of sense.
Raul got it. It's *always* good to have someone who can line up and take care of you.
In conclusion, the lieutenant's tone was extremely off.
"Not who I am. I'm not gonna argue with you."
Encyclopedia Of Wirrâl. Very thorough.
Mutter... that's all
"The others -- I don't recognize them. Perikarnassian or Revacholian. I'm just here to perform the ancient rites." She nods to the surgeon.
"I don't know? your a *so* kind and helpful person." He looks at you.
"It's better to be shot than hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was born too young."
"I am a highly experimental cop who wants to be a detective, sir!"
"I did not." She takes a drag, stretched. "None of those people saw him. None of them directed at him. They saw her as a *spell*."
*Clothes-style?* you wouldn't like what's out of place here.
You need to spend time *discussing* the theory, not the execution.
The Firewalker
"Not when you should be doing arts outreach in Jamrock. You're apolice outreach. I'm yourJamrock7, do you know me?"
"Acele, you've helped us for two days -- we're about to enter statistical significance."
"I'm calling it a malfunction, a spelling mistake... a *spell*."
foreign bodies.
You're not giving a shit. You're gonna go through this.
"Yes, I can see."
"Didn't see that, Kim."
Strodo now moves his hand to his nose and then his mouth -- with undivided attention -- to look first at the street grid of your birth, then -- later -- into the flames...
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese ultraliberal.
There! You know it!
"Reality? What is *in* this world?"
Still, he's getting it.
Naively, he tilts his head and falls forward.
What if I want to be a pseudo-scientist?
"What?" you start to cry.
He's a bit surprised you're even calling him that. You're a monster -- when are they going to get this?
"I'm Motorcycle Emptiness." He laughs. "I drive. These little musketeer-skulls is my *thing*."
"What is that -- your cabin in the sea?"
You also felt a sudden surge of décor. The stained glass of the display starts to quiver with the flash.
"It's just two neurons. There are four in me."
"Hm, I see you're in pursuit of something. A miracle. A clue. A *what*."
Do it? You feel your hands *breathe* as if you're on a high-net-worth date.
She's talking all this through everyday objects, barely holding a piece of broken postcard. Are you serious?
"Recording the conversations, you know. All of this. You do good for doing this, right?"
"You're all part of the same stinking clan," she responds matter-of-factly.
Spillane
Situation: Wild Pines.
"I don't think I want to live in this world." (Back off.)
What kind of professional to tell?
"TYPE?" He gasps under his shoulder. "*Everyone* doesn't know what that means. He means a type of terror. Charlie up, Tommy in the box. Klaasje in the kitchen."
"I'm a rock and roll star, not a witch doctor."
"I feel like we're in a *pale* of degenerates -- and ungovernable degenerates."
After a while you get used to the feeling. Like a wildlife photographer capturing birdsque in landscape style.
The Presence?
What is it about him...
"I'm sorry, man, I'm so sorry."
Alas. You can feel it. The run-off, the dampness... Maybe it was the wind?
Precinct 41. It's a very small building. It's not much.
Soft, jelly-like tears of muscle, hard and thin, fly out of your eye as you tilt your head, high above your head as below your knee.
You're not *unaware* of this -- nor is it a water lock or a grounding wire. Out of it.
*Bratan*. You're a disgrace to the RCM. I will kill you.
"It's stupid. You're still high."
"Wow. Turned some guys off. They don't like you any more."
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "I know what you're thinking, 'But not any kids.'"
"Why the hell would you be interested in a *stereo* amphetamine amphetamine amphetamine?"
What are they whispering in the ear lobes of their plastic explosives?
Won't help if they invest here!
"I'm not afraid of very aerostatic objects, I'm a super-detective."
"Oh..." the lieutenant closes his eyes. "He's a roughrider out there. Rough is tough."
N/A.
Nothing too noteworthy here.
"No need to take it off, it's too costly. With water, it can last a lifetime."
The Two-Face Paradox? You think it's one of these things, but what is this? Sadness? Doubt? You're not a *proper* man.
nothing. [Put away your gun.]
"I could come back in the city."
Apricot scented chewing gum wrapper.
What are you talking about? You look like a super-pig. Not a gardener, that's peanuts.
To his left, he picks his pearls. "To hell with the free world."
"I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't do it."
"Fuel?" The man chuckles. "How ironic: so many of our veterans are socialists themselves."
Negative. If you say so, they will know you're this far into a conversation. You're *very* paranoid.
*What do you do?* you hear, her voice from the other room.
"Whooh... That was easy. I know I need to do more like that. I can't be a *binoclard*, I've done it before."
"I don't know you look like drunks to me."
"The eyes in the glass are closed..."
"How am I going to solve this?" He looks down at his boots?
What about this? You need to *blast out* of this room with 40,000 total (mind your fat-fingers) and *escape* the door with *real power*. It would've been terrifying.
"Is my name what you call a *bronze*? I'm a bronze."
Where did you get those wires? Code for your repeater?
It's a variety of substances. Some you won't even talk about.
"I know it's hard. But you must understand that we are trying to *support* you when we are ceasing to exist. We are the enemies of humanity."
"It sounds as you requested, sir. In short: our conversation has now concluded."
"I was told you didn't."
"It's a very popular topic on the web forum. People talk a lot about the *pale* of history. Some even say there is a connection between the curse and the curse itself."
"I am not." He turns to the lieutenant. "This is costing jobs. Jobs for the *good* people."
How many of you people know? It must be at least a dozen.
What is that, an archetypal southern blotewrker look?
WRONG. You don't know *what* to tell yourself.
"You're not a real loser. You're not even human."
Wrap it in yourself.
You see, he's only fucking about *his* fault. You've fucked yourself.
*Klaasje*...
"You're a scab -- and you found it."
Something is different here -- he is, after all, untroubled by line of work and bearing witness to your unimportance. Everything is possible because of you.
Who's the lady driver?
You're not a moralist. You're a hobo cop. Think big, act big.
"I am an alcoholic, Harry. How can I help you today?"
"What can I do for you? My daughter's crying when we got here."
Never mind... You've been sitting for weeks.
But she isn't. She is the miracle...
There's more to it than that. You feel deprived of someone you love.
"May I suggest?" Your lips touch the bridge of the hull. This one's been there for weeks now.
"That's right, officer, the Wayfarer Act applies to you too -- for your actions."
Still there. Some of the loose stinking stuff has landed in the crook. Still, no sound.
"Cuno, it's the cop who's fucked." The kid is clearly having trouble believing you.
Ceau. [Leave.]
"Mm. They'd only do this if you plan to raise hell and bring order to the streets." She turns to you: "Maybe don't go and do your part yourself, detective."
"I'm sorry man, you're a *roo*. You're a broke cop who should be out of town. And *in* town -- because you knew what happened..."
* *The Measurehead*?
Of course. But you're not the only one. Maybe you can still convince the lieutenant?
BUT TEMPTION ISO.
Spinning out random notes.
"Yes. Other people -- you mentioned other things."
But. Maybe I'm not that anymore.
He's a moralist, believe it or not. He wants to punish by lead.
"Yes, it was me." She corrects a bit of winking. "The Madre for whom I spoke said it would be a 'miraculous development'!"
*Psionic* will you?
"No it's not *that* cool. A cool outlaw cloak..."
Bastion is the heart of the case. Holy work, so you don't have it. Do what thou wilt will do
*What a disappointment*. People like that *stuff*. You think about them so much...
Cunogo.
Time for  Titus to go. Purge the poor huddled under the perforation lines.
Thank you. You have done my country a great service.
Gimme what now?
"No. Sorry, Noid... It's pretty simple actually. You have to supply interesting ingredients. I have some meat, I have brains, but I have no idea what you're talking about." He looks around.
A shudder of disgust crosses her face, but nothing comes over you -- and you can feel it no longer...
WHAT ARE YOU USING?
Solar power has always been about inverting the balance of power in your household -- your money, your time.
"I'm a god of Kegs. And I'm not a fan of either sex."
What is that... a struggle?
" Eva Berenger is the former lead programmer of the Like A M Whirling Whirling's popular board game, whose simple, 8-bit aesthetic won her a lorryman's brow...
Pull your fingers out.
"The two are mutually exclusive."
But what if you're not going to sleep until hours are up?
"Standard, let's not get into speculative economy!"
This was not about luck or manipulation. He wanted something more... *interesting*.
A cargo belt twists the dead man's neck, fasten it to the board, and fasten it to the frame-gun. You're tense.
"A Boogie Street gang that kills and beats, for fun, on sight. The faces of the nobility are painted black. They are the faces of Revachol West."
Stupid idea.
"Anyway, he's a real man born to win. He won't be beating the shit out of you, so no -- I won't *challenge* you. Just let me ask *you* something else."
There was a time when you could just climb the ladder to the roof, use the radio to call the library, use the fridge to freeze the victim's body, but that was in the late thirties.
"It's *totally* unimportant," he replies with a nod. "You just fucked yourself in the ass -- now watch your ass in Cuno's kingdom!"
Are you sure about that?
"Of course," he notes. "We got some serious talk with the lab -- she could have *seen* it. She's not some crazy-ass driver. You'd have to knock her out."
"I don't like begging." She closes her eyes and sighs. "But there are many soucriant who just want something for nothing, almost all the time."
Girard? Oh, that's right. I need to hear your story through your eyes.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good *wights* every time you talk to him. Every time he talks to you.
"I am a modern socialist, believe me. I like being outside on the beach with sea birds."
Afraid of what?
"Tell me." He waits patiently. "There are some books in the bookstore, but they're not particularly good. Unless you're into that family..."
"What is it?" The woman twirls her hair. "It's *Hiroshiorito*. It's the spring of '51."
Breathing... this strange liquid starts glowing -- like real ice.
Alone, seated in a dark, weather-worn cubicle with no one moving, the only objects of interest are sheets and music. Time to proceed...
"What what?"
"Welcome, an obligation!" He quickly fills his lungs and looks around, taking in the room.
So it *did* come from the cover of this one?
Knows you can't. Or you haven't asked them yet.
The Door To The Hanged Man is a standard part of the tourist traps discussed earlier.
You're not. The name is João. It's Guillaume Le Million. It's Guillaume.
"hey, you're my partner, a police detective. You're a model."
"I am conducting an operation."
"In this church?" She looks at you, distracted.
"I am a malignant *Entity*..." The lieutenant looks squinting at him.
"Do you dumpster diving?"
"Only when you're under arrest."
You've got to the next level, you canNOT be a loser. YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT

*And* weasel's got his eye on you. He's just going to leave -- to the Mother's glory, before the world.
"You're not going anywhere. You'll find a way." He takes another sip. "If you want to."
"I am an antiques cop."
Al gulps. "Okay, I'm going to show you this weekend!"
"Who do you want me to *connect*?"
The Greatest Option.
*Just* a book isn't it?
"I didn't *kill* him."
"It was a question then. Where were we, where were we? You wanted to know something?"
*K-kacon*,* K-acon!* The man sounds confident and proud in your hands. *Make sure* the k-bacon doesn't *everevereverever* reach the neck of your neck.
"Welcome to Revachol?" She says something, but her lips are stone like. "I think you should do the same thing with your speakers."
"I'm going to use it in defence of private property."
What are *you*?
"Weren't they *killing* them?"
"Dad --up." She looks at her pendant in the corner. "I still have to get it exactly like you asked. There's some time to spare."
"I am close, Harry." He leans in so close you can feel his pulse rising through the hangover. "You are in the *heart* of it. *Handled* it. I am your partner. I think."
Strodo
This is it -- You got the call. The damage to your health is *massive*. Massive.
"The Pigs Are Different... Phoenix." He shakes his head. "The world is sick and tired of this old fuck. God damn it, you're sick!"
Do not get us into this mess!
What's wrong? Your nose is not producing the correct frequency either.
"I know I've been under false pretenses. And it's all the fault of someone I love."
"I am sorry, sir. I don't want to."
"Tell me, mister." He sounds a little annoyed...
"I have to."
The amphetamine in your hand has a golden, sticky feel to it, like you just took a gulp of that sweet candy.
"I've tried not to look at you too many things related to the little you've been doing."
"Hm, I see you've been following me around. On occasion..." She looks east, toward the bay. "But I think I can help you with something."
"Anytime." She barely looks up from the keyboard. You can hear the music on the other end.
"I would really prefer a corpse-less jacket -- not like the pile of soggy old lady sweaters on the street."
"7-ye-23." She breathes in the menthol
Threw your hands up in the air.
This is also the only point of origin she can reach from the sea floor -- and it is among the few points of origin most likely to be spared.

No mention of a body on the island.

"Another... third... the..." She stops mid-sentence.
"Oughts?" She nods. "Well, I guess we're all doing really good together."
"Can't you take a look at this place again? This is the *Eminent Domain*," he points to the shelves. "*The* door."
Why are you even still reading this? Don't overdo it. You're a burden, they are.

"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know why I said that." (Shake it in your hand.)
"I *did*." He looks in the bottle. "I *made* him stop."
Be untroubled.
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle.) [Leave.]
WHAT? You're just worried about the *partying* part, aren't you? The union is gonna wreck your day, just don't mess around, you're a pansy.
"Okay, I've still got the components."
It's a shame... You might've like a little of both.
You're right, it's bird shit. It doesn't fit well and says nothing.
Should I? This sounds like a potential *bad* thing to
I can't leave. There are kids under the dam and the only way to get out is to break into their village.
"Do it."
I am going to ask that question again.
"Hey, what the fuck are you doing?"
"I didn't say I was a cop. I said I'm a labour leader and that I lost my sense of *being*."
Dammit, ask someone else for your passport.
WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NAIVE MEGA OF HATCHERS?!
The wind is warm. It bleeps out the window of the nearby kitchen. You can barely feel the creaking of pots and pans inside.
"Okay. It couldn't have been that. Your grandma is a giant of the world." She waves her hand in the air. "My grandma is streethinking and that's why I had to take her in."
"Hello. I'm Gary, and I'm leaving this to the police. It's their business."
"I'm going to leave it out of my report."

"His shirt... 'The Sun' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
"Don't you want to know? How am I?"
"So... did you kill him?"
"I am an officer of the RCM, not some feudal vigilante."
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments -- so much so that even the lieutenant can't help but nod in approval.
Ugh... yes. It's moving in the dark. All the sudden he gets a scream for his men and women.
Alongions in his spine. He likes voicing them
Voyager Road
Ugh, it. But he did...
what if I'm thinking of going home?
It's a classic, too, yes, with a touch of rock and roll.
"Hepatobiliary?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
This is a very bad mannered man -- not to mention smart. But he's got his own plan.
"I'm going to look for more famous people and if it leads to anything, I'll let you go."
"Titus -- you can get to the island first if you want. But we're talking a 12-hour flight here. All is good."
Ceau. [Finish thought.]
"What's happening?" (Put your hand on the injury.)
*Snap, snap!* the glass of the old ways collide, shattering the curtains like rotten logs. The ruins criss cross the plaza.

Not a speck of irony in there. He's *confiscating* facts.

Went straight. At your own pace. Wanna see why?
Usual is a slippery word. It does not *always* work out.
"In the Beachhead bunker, *pig* had his head shaved!"
And what was that -- the *entire* week?
"I just don't know where you think we're putting this."
"Ah, come to think of it, yes. That is what it is."
This is a very slippery target. You need to be careful, lest you draw the wrong conclusion.
"I've heard the *ka-ching*," she nods. "Kipt is what people used to come to study this beast of the jungle."
"He was in a delirium?" She smirks. "No, he's in a coma. A coma of

"I would never cause more harm to anyone -- especially a police officer -- by telling a friend you just got shot. I'm not a gardener, or a funeral home. I'm a legal counsellor for the homeless youth."
Sure. It doesn't help with the chest pain... or your hangover? Would've been a good idea to get a heart attack check instead.
"Hm. Maybe you should ask me something else."
The phone has disconnected.
"In any case," the lieutenant mumbles, "this isn't about that. It's about investing time and resources into the side effects, and then conveniently forgetting about them."
"A very, very satisfied customer." He feels satisfied.
Drop the gun
"He's glad to see you, Kim. You're helping him. I'm glad to see you. You're helping him. I'm glad to see you."
Do you even... know what's behind that curtain?
Ask the pigs for a hint. They'll learn quickly.
You can't just pick one, you have to do something *else*.
"I'm a serious man, I need to get my marriage under wraps!"
Won't roll if you fuck yourself again!
A woman like this, in her late thirties, was almost entirely naked.
"I know you have, to some extent, always will. I'm a sucker for the self-deprecating clothes ads."
*Swallow it, Kim!"* he says, trying to control himself. "No one wants that Cuno."
What's what? You're... Harry.
It's a real killer. Not some *eerie* fridge.
"Whoa." He turns to you. "You were *right* here. She should have seen it coming. It was in her head."

"I'm quite sure I don't." She gestures at her travel bag, where a pair of pair of FALN sneakers were caught on film.
*Spoken that way, you think* -- all that venom is contributing to pain and suffering.
Cuno is your guy. Cuno's in charge. Cuno *controls* the streets. The streets of Revachol, the People's Republic of the Third Empire. You are under its rule.
He covers up his bruised brow. "That wasn't me. They just wanted to have sex with me. And I had other people *see* them."

"What do you think happened?" The lieutenant whispers to you, obviously startled.
There are firearms lying around here, stocked up on paper. You should look around.
You've got to try to stay strong for this guy, recruit and train!
Maybe this young woman will open up about this dark vision of hers -- sometime. She must have had something more *incriminating* to say about.
"I don't care about your, officer. I don't care about your feelings. I don't care about police work. I don't care about the streets." (Point toward the alley.)
"I am a filthy cop who wants nothing *more* than to be one with the law."
Very cool. You're a 'cool cop'.
"I suck. You're thinking -- what would that be without the *anodic dance music*?"

"I am very, *very* sorry. But that doesn't explain how I lost my balance..."
"It's a great place to hide, see all the weirdos and shit, and there's lots of weirdos," she says matter-of-factly.
Pull the water out. *Purple* soap.
The figures don't speak for me.
What does she mean -- nervous breakdown?
What you should do now is contact the Pinball Union.
Nothing tightens. You're still cold. The sting is worth it.
A curious shape-shifting creature!

But still... you might have an easier time wrestling the boots off a bloated, dead man.
Brother, you're so good at co-working, you could've easily won this battle for you. You could even have gotten the prisoner Klaasje.
"What happened to *me*?"
"Order the fucking fuck out of him, bitch!"
"Hey, can I call you both LESLIEURS? And SAR. When will you need them?"
He's not very good at politics -- is it a type of sarcasm he'd be more interested in pursuing, other than politics?
Holding a conversation in their faces is called *peter-aut waxing* by some.
*Sneak around* is an ill-advised way of putting it.
"I didn't see a speck of smoke coming from the curtains. Was this one of our friends?"
"Good good, now that this has been a long talk... What about it?"
Cuno is in there.
Not happy for some reason.
" -- your..."
May the Mother love be with you.
"I'm still looking for the mugger, but he got away."
slurpingly. But don't.
Seems... unprofessional of you to ask such a thing.
"I've got couple of questions for you first."
RIGHT ON: WHERE THE LIGHT COMES -- ONCE AGAIN.
Great, this is the answer.
Maybe try again, he thinks. This is a bad idea.
Time for your soliloquy. Let's be honest, you didn't know it! Your nose is the apex of the human visual system, and it's so dumb. You're seeing half the world and half the world will be out in a few years. You have to be BETRAYALGED.
Do you know what she's using as her personal terminal?
"A rifle's scope has the best magnification."
*Orcología individuela*. The world's largest organization of the narcotic trade.
"A voracious reader, she thinks. She's the wife of a successful real estate agent. Very valuable..." She touches the window. "Inside, on the balcony..."
"I've been really into these *skull shit* cunts lately. Don't ever do anything racist or fascist. Because that would be insane."
"I'm still *totally* okay with this -- getting mauled by an animal just because it looks like me. I'm Katarzine Alasije."
Your hand moves on the question.
Thank you for reporting the hanging. It was an accident -- you should have jumped first.
Snakes or intestinal worms? Must be fishwater.
"You're with us. The workers."
You have *plenty* of reason to be happy. Nothing shortage of self-pity.
"I'm a realist. You can't deny it." He nods approvingly. "It would be nice to see your skin covered in snow."
Just you, your tender, bubbling skin, immovable like that of a beehive on a string. Light the candle and fall asleep.
Your fingers squint at the figure in person. On the bright side -- it's not Katarzine Alasije. It probably wouldn't have been you.
"Never say that. This is a joke."

You, he means you. He's not going to hit you over the head with proof you don't have. But he'll circle you.

More than 2,000 litres of distilled spirit were stacked on top of one another, secured by adhesive tape.
"Filippe, there's a corpse hanging in the tree. There must be a *foot* in the bushes."
*You have to* answer this question.
"The Gloaming" is upon us. The Gloaming will begin soon. Soon the Gloaming will be upon us. Soon the Gloaming will be upon us."
The sounds above are not connected with any *music*. You hear the bed rattling and shuffling, the music on the speakers, the music on the radio.
"Your partner must be very *passionate*."
See? And you don't want any part of that?
Rubbish... This is nothing. He's a connoisseur of outright lies.
Do you really want to know? Because the kitchen *is* pretty awful and the kitchen is damn giant. And the cleaning lady is a terrible mother.
Grilled him about cleaning workers.
*Art* sounds good -- but what *is* art?
A woman has been raped. The perpetrator is often a woman. And in *all* of them. This is a sign of *not* progress.
Ominous task force.
The clip takes the shape of a three piece pendant held in each of the three hands by a silver thread. The number on the clip is written on the front.
Dammit... I did I didn't know you were a cop. Okay? This is what the Founding Party is for, huh?
slurp. That's it. You were the one supposed to get the gun, right? TO THE POOL?!?!?
"I haven't been 100% truthful with you, officer. This is a very serious matter and I need to be transparent about it."
But, Harry, when you're deep in work, where the tide is beginning to subside? Where once you let your hopes and dreams flow over the surface waters?
"I don't know what work *is*," he says, giving you a disgusted glance. "I don't understand what you're talking about."
No
*Answers*? That doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in...
"Yeah, okay..." you can
"I've been tempted..." She thinks. "But not by you. More than once. I still hope you didn't. I still hope they don't."
"The hospitality scene is a shithole. Not good for me, my friends come to stay at the Whirling."
"I *will* get to it. I will finish the sentence. If you keep moving..."

The cookout sign doesn't say anything, but it says: "Tues. Octobefits, ltn. Xmas present, LOS. It's bye now."
*Drugs* -- that's what the Hardie boys did. With your little lab crush, when you had your mind set on those pills.
And the Doomed Commercial Area is also where Titus lives. Near where he came from, probably.
You can. It all comes together now -- this is serious. (Close the book.)
"I didn't see a shadow of a doubt in the dark that night. We should have checked downstairs. The kitchen is next to Field-Tripwire. Smokable smokes there."
"I have a feeling. But I am not sure. Anything else?"
"Are we?" She grabs the side of her quilt skirt.
"Ah, but I *am* a merciful king," he explains. "Your Majesty will restore order to the market."
This does not come as good news for either of you.
Ceau? You feel the need to cover up for your love of this? Aren't you a little close to home, really, but somehow you feel like you *don't* deserve it more than you *know*.
"I'm a superstar -- let's rock the Hardie boys!"
*Role-playing games?* You glad you have time to play role-playing games -- so you don't go to the toilet.
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about? The cop you hanged?"
forward from Touloula, meander off into the ether; head inland for more.

"Fuel?" The operator turns down the device. "Yes, it's in the trash -- just like any other old device."
Something cracks in there. A weight ishes over you, a strange fear sinking into you.
43) What if I want to *not* be a cop, or a firefighter, or... oh no...
What if he can get away with it?
" – The operator' uniform. "
"I'm not afraid. I'm just telling the story."
Getting... too difficult.
*I *was* a communist? What about it?
What happens if you fail? What else?
"Tell me." He stops you. "Is there anything I can do for you right now, officer?"
*NOW* you need to get *ready to fight...
Dig deep enough to find the answer.
What are they whispering, fiddle-swinging illiterates?
Claire thought it would be okay to have sex with you.
The Greatest Option?
"Enough for now." [Leave.]
"Good to see you again, Fortress Accident."
The bread is crusted, the noodles are coarse, and the seaweed is marbling...
Your hand starts to move. The plastic of the trap is shaking with it's trembling.
The feeling causes all the stress to wear off. Now the only thing left to do is get drunk.
"For my shack!"
*Might* be a good offer, although it seems more like an order than a duty. Don't lose your gun and wait for the answer...
"I'm sorry I'm here." [Leave.]
"Remain collegial, officer. You're responsible people, just don't want random strangers asking you to show you your AR-15."
The aim is to save lives. Save lives. Save the world. Save the road. Save the world.
"I *know*... there's one on the roof." (Point behind your ears.)
Get lost, soon. Go to the pier where you can get out there. Explore.
Who does? You? You're a fucking kooky oaf, you know that?
"I am, yes. But we do need to get those sneakers back."
"Aw, I already *ran*.net! Goddamn..." He pauses to think. "What the fuck does that have to do with Ruby?"
Carly, get the corpse down.
By any chance... he's about to put his life on the line to defend you?
"You all barked the orders. Didn't tell *everything*." She shrugs. "Suck my pride, now."
"We *lost* someone here?" The lieutenant is breathing heavily now, but he's not really paying attention to what you said.
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I've already *de-escalated* it."
Safety pins?
You, a detective of the RCM.
Doesn't sound like you're planning to go into a fire!
"I am the reincarnation of the great king Guillaume. I'm going to take over the church of Saint-Batiste."
"I am trying to connect with the Remote Viewers Division."
Pull the water out and put it in.
"Ex-wife?" The girl looks up, her eyes wide with worry.
The box. You see the same box in the corner of the room. You are relieved.
So... he might actually be doing something...
Beautiful, isn't it? Looks like the jacket will do the trick!
"What's it to your brain?"

"Hm?" She looks at your hand. "I haven't really been expecting this. I should have signed the papers. But I didn't."
"Wow," she smiles, as the world tightens around you. "Wow."
"I am a moralist. I believe in the proper handling of the law."
"It's a shame we only got two days remaining."
"I am Lilianovich Dros, the son of the Honourable Dolores Dei."
"The Mother disapproves." The eyes smile enigmatically.
"Can't- there's a giant ice bear fridge under the boardwalk."
flipping through the files you find yourself pulled into a few pages on fire. The last row says: "Evidence of the Man from Hjelmdall."
Bag your tongue.
"Khm... yeah." He shakes his head. "This here... we suspects there may well be foul play involved."
"I don't... don't know what to say... What was that?"
*You*?
"Cuno's gonna scram, sayin' it." He rubs his temples. "Cuno knows this shit. Gets pumped. Cuno knows you're not gonna get helpin' if you don't scram."
And without question -- it's presence would most likely make the residents of the yard suspicious of any suspicious activity.
"Tell me... was this not on your resume, by the way?"
It's a bit like he's being told the same thing four times.
J'acconeurs, huh? Sounds like they're planning to make their wares in this part of the world more difficult, by the thousands.
*Such a fine soul*, aren't they?
What is it?, they're trying to say.
"The most beautiful unit of study in the world." She observe your eyes, studying the colours and the patterns on the surface.
But she's *sighted* them. The sight is bothering her.
Coalition aerostatics.10 km.
"It's a music thing. Nothing fancy, just for now. You can dance."
"What can you say about the lining? The gun?"
"I've got a few more questions for you." (Proceed with the next part.)
"A god damn right corner, Kim!"
A familiar thread runs through your being: who you are -- and what you're trying to do here.
"You know, I can see into the great desolation." She nods. "The stuffy wards of the Endbringers..."
The ginger root? This is the same young male you saw earlier when you were still under her spell. He's dark, almost white...
Shall we do the machine-examination? The question is how?
"I am an officer of the RCM, dedicated to maintaining law and order in Revachol."
*Bring it down*. The three metres tall stick insect should be crushed to death. It's not going to happen.
"It's just the truth."
Yet? You have the training, the feet...
Saint-Batiste, the city in the north-east, where once the city was built.
*Your* nodding.
Sell the boat.
"I haven't been... (hic) oh."
"I don't know what you're talking about... I've killed birds *and* been in a boat full of..." He pauses for dramatic effect. "...*kebabombs*."
"No one cares." She looks out the window. She doesn't know why, but she does.
You can't. There's no way this man can still pull his outrage at you.
"The end is here." He whispers.
D
"Whoahaha..." the rat-faced man looks at his buddy, then turns to you. "What are you doing here? They're fucking snitching on us. We need to dance!"
" -- In Revachol."
"You know, I just wanna hear my share, Harry." He smiles warmly. "It's been a long winter. Do you know why it's cold?"
"Do you think that may be the case?"
Harry really cares about that *bullet* thing, he's a good man, has good intentions.
"I'm a moralist."
And thank you, it truly was worth it.
*Much* less convincing. It's easier to reach your gloved hands under your coat any time you tell a joke. Now, do youre thinking of taking it back?
Andre, the Game Master
Just better. You feel lucky.
"No. No. Thank you."
"I don't know hoot, Cuno!"
"You know, a trained killer who's trained by the Semenese?"
"Titus, I found a tape with some junk in it. It's called 'I'm In Love With Her.'"
"It's a pity..." she looks around, the wind blowing outside her window. "I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about."
Gather in as much as you can.
"I've heard rumours of a *third* death... perhaps it's a *cluster-fuck*?"
"Awkward." He snarls. "Any news on my previous squad mates?"
"You know, actually, when I say *real* I don't mean *real* like this person. This *Process* needs to be re-conceptualized. I just need you to help me."
Tell her.
What is this one's purpose?
She smiles and nods with herberry-coloured wiles.
A middle-aged man stands in front of a machine shop, wearing dark brown trousers and light brown sneakers. The man's face is covered in a bandage. The walls around him are covered with dust.
The window feels warm. The wind howls into the surrounding clouds, tumbling down from the sky like snow on a cracked beam.
VICTORIA -- VEGETABLES -- NOBLE SIGNS TO THE PINK BLOB -- VOTERANT VOTERANT! -- VOTERANT NOBLE TO THE PINK BLOB! -- VOTERANT NOBLE TO THE PINK BLOB! -- VOTERANT VOTERANT!
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And maybe a shirt? Or pants? Or maybe boots? But it doesn't!
It's a sharp pain, coming from the back of your throat. It's coming from the corner of your arm. You're going to get it in the next room, where you can scream to the heavens: "I AM THE GODDAMNED LAW AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME!"
You're a copin' right, everything's gonna be alright.
"I have a cigarette every night while I go over my notes. It's something to keep in mind for the rest of my days."
"I didn't *kill* her." He looks away, his eyes full of anguish. "I just knew what I was doing. It's all right, now..."
"Something small? What?"
"I'm waiting for the miracle to happen. For Revachol to flourish. To make it palatable for middle-class families. A tax cut for the middle class."
Get off the craven road... Where is your booze, you're a bum.
"Any other clues? I haven't gotten a single reply from my men, even reaching me... Did you kill him?"
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your bad gym teacher talk to you."
"Seriously, though, you should ask where the lady driver is. I've been trying to contact her, but haven't heard back  yet."
*Teleportation' is something you've been guilty of... but how?
"In a locked and protected bunker in an intense *special operation* dubbed 'Silent Return.'" The lieutenant jabs the metal. "In there, hidden, right past the sight of the two bullet holes. And in the farthest reaches of the *fägäri* -- the vengeful spirits of old Vredefort. *You* to carry."
"Cuno... Cuno was trying to find out what the *bloodshot* feels like."
Should I be worried? The girl behind the counter just *knew* it wasn't her. Should've...
"Authority?" He looks at you inquisitively.
busy waiting...
*Did* I didn't kill him the way I used to, was it?
But what?
"The Remote Viewer."
"Whoa, what's the deal?"
"It's a number, officer, something... You must have *some* on you."
"I am a police officer, yes. Yes. I can compete with you."
Do one of these: A) take the hanged man's neck, (b) take the life of that hanged man? Or (c) take the life of that woman? (Opt in.)
Love..."
"Titus. You're right. Not enough officers. In fact we should, we should have a grand opening on the crime scene."
"I'll write the serial number I've taken."
I don't care about any of that. I just want to live.
"I am a bit surprised to hear that," she says, "but the RCM does not discriminate. Anyone can become a member."
Have you noticed the strange sensation of light there pouring out of you -- slowly soaking you? When you look north the mirror of your death does reveal itself?
"You know, Mr. Du Bois, you're right. This is Martinaise, it's the place to be."
" -- now, don't worry, detective -- we are still at the *break* in the canal." He takes a quick note in his notebook. "We should probably get back to our case."
Time to turn off the god damn radio, boiadeiro!
"That's why you've still got your guys down. Don't anyone else come sniffing around? Just... sniffing. They're gonna wreck you. You're gonna shit yourself."
His eyes narrow. "You."
The magnesium levels in your blood are dangerously low. It should have been magnesium, but you don't have enough. You need a drink. Or a sandwich. Or even a smoke. If you want to salvage this...
Passport and visa.
A reply! Snap your fingers in the dark.
Dark gleaming machinery. From a tower above a city block. Bullets fly above a courtyard of some sort.
Doesn't matter. You're just creepy.
"He's a cockatooian. I'm helping him."
"To hell we go..." The lieutenant sounds disappointed, but he doesn't say anything.
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, but I'm sorry I crashed."
"How you're not *your* main contractor here, though? If someone tampered with the walls -- you wouldn't want to get in a bad way."
Arno van Eyck.
"A spoonful of armour would do that."
With his butt end where the bullet point, and his cheeks where the tear in the eye-socket go, Mr. Du Bois becomes painfully clear of what he is *doing* here.
All, judging by the wording, that part is a *container*. Someone should open them, and, possibly, stash them in a dry safe.
"And what exactly you're doing against the Union?"
This is a tremendous stress. It's thinking. It throws the thought away.
"A coffee shack on the river?"
"When you've seen it all go *away* like that, it's pretty strange..."
"Who does?" The lieutenant peeks at you. "You wanna fuck with me?"
Impressing at the bottom of his lungs! A single black drop of blood could be responsible for at least bringing mankind out of the Pale.
Voyager Road? is the largest terminal in Revachol West -- and by extension, there is no other. And thus far, no cargo container.
"You know, I don't."
Dark eyes survey the coast, mapping the area as if it were Villiers. A hundred years ago. Before the cannons took this part of Revachol.
Along with the two gloves you find a ring with a small perforation in it.
"I am not responsible for what people choose to do. They grow up with it. It's a part of them. It's what they do. But you can't have one with a lot of guns."
Make them waste away in the bushes and reeds and shit.
"You're the symbol of the male-down. The domination mind-fuckers."
Police paraphernalia. Hard to say which is more...
Goddamn
clearly... you need to focus on other things. on the case. not this case.
Enough. [Leave.]
"Well, I *know* it's not a traditional seafort. And the wards are *disco*. Disco is a horrible word for it."
By far, yes. If even remotely... if at all. the gradient of light could reach this spot. The spot. In the darkness. And you must rule out those who claim to be Filippe III (the Filippe).
*Ting. The tingling comes from somewhere -- *downstream*. Up into your basal ganglia. Time to get *put* back where you belong, son!
Busted yourself. It's nearly impossible.
"I'm a smart cop, that's why I chose this place."
Dunno, Girard... maybe.
"Why the fuck would he do that? It's not for the *cultural exchange*. It's for *advertising*. It's *advertising*."
She's solid as a rock, but granite when it comes to booze. You feel it in your shoulders and under your armpits, as you sip from the pilsner.
"Good. Now, was there
"7th FEB, '53."
"It's just a wall, aren't we? It's a wall."
"Mhmh," she nods. "I'm not a moralist. I think everything has a price."
I find it hard to believe. I must confess that I am, indeed, a fan of the RCM.
"Ah, well -- I wouldn't have guessed that from the cover." He pushes the device aside in your hand. "I mean, there's the water lock, the key to the water lock, the key to the water lock... You should try to get them unlocked."
"That's why I'm undercover in the enforcement."
You already tried *everything* but that. Firing it up.
"Dad -- you're not a SKULL. You're a *psychic*, where are you?"
Eugene wants this place to be his playground. It's uniform anyway. Bathe in honour and glory.
"If I were to start asking my boys questions, I would stop for now." (Proceed.)
Sure, you're. These are the *honour's* of hard core. If you don't show up in police colours like he does, then who will?

"I don't know what, what did he look like... I was just trying to blend in."
"I am a legal counsellor for
"I am an officer of the RCM. The murder weapon." The lieutenant is addressing you.
This is all very good.
"I am about to cryomancy! Majesty, open the door to the pew! Majesty, this is Firewalker. The Firewalker of Martinaise!"
But wait! There's plenty to get excited about! This is why you need to know.
"hey." He looks you up and down. "*Weird* of me? Okay, I get it. Sort of. But you know what?" He shakes his head. "You shouldn't expect anything less from me."
Cuno's Diamond Tiara."
*This ring!* The young man kneels first, with his left hand, on the ring. Hedonist John McCoy's lit up cigarette, unfastening it.
There's no Dora who you can say...
"I did. It was a stupid plan -- and I'm sorry."
 Recipes she has prepared herself.
"Well, I understand." The lieutenant adopts a more defensive tone, shoulders relaxed. "I'm not surprised. We have to be more careful *or* we'll get our ass handed to us. The materials we have at our disposal are bigger than those socialist garbage buster's families."
The sooner you finish this task, the sooner you can start the next one
"Hepatobic? How do you say that to me, Titus?"
"Khm... a totally different world then one we're in. A real strange one."
"Host of the Universe Today," he says as if it were a familiar story. "The rich man has a brain. Connect it to his lover. Make it up."
A challenge? This isn't *too* hard.
Why am I looking at all of these options?
"Khm. The *big cop gig* -- I don't wanna get into that."
Feels like you got too many low-down moments before.
Hold your nerve...
"A sanctuary is a place where a powerful *idea* is realized, something that can be achieved by manipulating the economic conditions in which the person is setting herself goals. A rather *mainstream* way."
"A pre-revolutionary tenement, part of the bustle of Rue de Saint Ghislaine." (The cul-de-sac is right outcropping the formerly gaudy yet strangely inviting 50 per cent black inner-streets.)
Don't even try. It's too much.
Sure, you're drunk. But that doesn't mean you should open fire -- it's best to be on your guard.
Of course! He's always there, guarding you.
"Are you okay?" He looks down at his boots, still damp from the wind. "as long as you don't fly there?"
*I* think there's a sniper's nest... *underground* -- it's
Carried Good.
Oops...
"To be honest it's pretty hard to compete with that." He sniffles. "Where do we *go*? We're not winning."
Not this will make things any better at her husband. He has bad habits.
Your right arm, which is the only part he can bend slightly. Makes the flesh quiver. The *stench* is well worth the expense.
"Welcome to Revachol! Revachol is the only bright democracy around. Every citizen gets a fair shake on this great crown of devotions."
"I am." (Wipe your eye.)
Figured out the armour.
" Like a... lesser-known supra-natural being..."
The Delta Commerce Centre.
"I'm sorry, officer, you were being kind. It's not my first time having this kind of display. And I am not responsible for it. If you want me to talk about my daughters behaviour, you can do so here..."
Thanks for stopping by, lieutenant! We talked about this game a great deal. He should've steered clear of it... HEY, REELS!
* *I* am here to stop this madness.
Slow down, Gaston: "This is such a Sad City, kids. I can barely get up and walk around here. It's *bad* for business. But me... I just like doing this -- sitting on this bench with my knee to my knee, trying not to sweat."
"It's a pity. The world could use a good, hard-asin' good repair guy."
"I'm a disco die-fer. I like disco."
"I'm a realist. Rock and roll."
"It's a pity. I hoped that you would try. I was wrong. But we need to talk to them now." He looks around. "We need to get the body down from the tree."
There may be some way to harvest Sylvie's pity. (Proceed.)
"Funk won't do it again. Cuno's gonna fuck himself.'"
You're a bit disappointed, Alice.
"I don't think I've ever lived through more organized crime syndicates opening up shop in my establishment." She takes a sip.
"I am not wearing any more part-wear clothes. And I also don't really need your money."
"hey? You've had a epileptic seizure? I can't be a feminist."
It was the decade you rolled into the next.
*Super* kind of a jerk, but true to yourself. Uncover and exploit those around you.
"I don't *know* what happened in the kitchen. I don't know what happened here. But it's hard to trust a bunch of strangers after all that happened."
"I'm a cop? What else are you?"
"Oh, I *do* know that! And that's why I'm here for. Now please give me some more of your time."
"It's just the way of the sea. Some kind of psychopath would do it."
"I have a feeling... your husband Victor Méjean is a communist. Close friends of mine from Kedra, they all say he's an inspiration to me."
"I. E. -- I didn't see it."
But you don't want to see that shit. You want to FREAK OUT.
*Your* you. He's not judging.
Why are you even still reading this? Don't you want to be the crab man?
"She made the call. It was on the other line. There was no mention of the phasmid in there."
What is it feelin?
"I've been squinting harder than I'll ever finish my last one."
Goddamn *no one* tells you to fuck off or something. You're too fucking stupid to even think that.
You're a smart, clever man, but you haven't put up with anything in twenty years.
"Shakin' at him. What a sad sight!"
Pale? Is it really that long ago? It feels so faint...
What does that remind him of?
"I *would*." (Nod approvingly.)
*They'll kill you. Police officers. Or hanged -- I don't even know of IIRC-Knows-dead -- most of them."
"I do. *Look* at it. It's my flask. You can take it too." He slides the pouveillance blanket over it and lets it rest at his side.
*Baby, be careful!* is not what the girls want you to do.
The gale wind blows in from the coast, a wave heightening the heights, brackish water dripping off the pier, and the night sky.

*Your* view is shared by all, the rest is non-existent.
Doesn't keep your emotions to themselves. Makes your head explode from all the static and overwhelming terror.
"I am of the view that you're making headway in your field -- that you're not, actually. That you should be, actually. That you should *not* be making head... Think about what you could do to improve your standing in that regard. That you could *improve* your standing in your husband's."

A man named Gary, his face contorted with rage, is sitting on a thick pile of cheap-looking tools. They're all piled high -- a pile of old sunglasses, a pile of old coal-burning power tools, a pile of old cigarettes.

C'mon... you've got to get this *right* now. This is your chance to shine. We're not giving you shit, cut your shit up, you need to *do* this.
Kissed it -- lightly.
You mean the windows? Yeah, you picked the wrong one! *Believe* the staircase is it.
Its pretty. She knew he was a man of the left, what with everything -- always trying to make things right. Sadly, she assumed leadership of the Wild Pines Group.
Sandpaper adds a touch of realism. When you take off the garish visor and add a splash of realism, there's no time to lose. You can make out the words: *Declaration of War*.
But is that a classier project?
He cups. "You're right, officer. That was a *very* good question. But don't let this distracting chatter show itself -- look at the big picture."
*They're* not good guys.
Getting up... feels good. Feels like a high-quality predator behaviour.
"I haven't. Neither do I care about any of this."
Carly... your heart beats faster.
Deny her the key to the hidden room.
"I'm sorry I was hungover."
Your fingertips touch your forehead. Darkness. And the name on the doorbell too: darkness. A familiar feeling...
Flee the booth and walk off.
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. You're high. This man is about to go off the charts.
"I've got a number of questions for you then."
"S-special-effects?" He stares at you, baffled.
No no. It's just that the material is foreign.
Bag the pockets of your jacket.
It feels like you're squinting at him. The look comes through: He's really stinking, even by this point.
"His paranoia seemed well kept up to this day. I always looked for unusual activity in his life. He was a regular pick-up-artist, as usual. He seemed to be busy..."
"I'm sorry. We shouldn't have antagonized him. I was trying to avoid drawing direct upon *her*."
"Fucking grandma, huh? That's why you're the only one here."
We in the Special Administrative Region, on the other hand, command. We can see where these men are pointing...
"I am a *police* officer, not a *art* gallery. I want to talk to you."
And none of the men. Not a handful. Let's double check the veracity of this rumour.
"Like you're art."

All I can say is: you've got to go with the first.
"I found a ruler from that church who listened to the tape and blessed it. Very advanced."
"I am a bourgeois woman and this is causing me physical harm."
"hey."
There are no objections. This one's a simple and rugged mercenary.
It feels like she would have. This feels like the perfect moment for a rape joke.
Sail away. Let's talk about how you stink in this Frittte post.
"I would never go in there if I were a police officer. I would never do anything like that."
"I'll leave that choice to you..." (Proceed.)
It's too late. Everyone should have the gun, they're too young!
"Hell yes! You finger-pistols will pierce through the skullless chill of *party time*."
"What kind of a mercenary is he?"
"I am an alcoholic. Alcoholism has made me into an idiot."
The cook, holding a pie on your ass, is also not smiling. Probably because you're hising up your social standing.

*Put the music away* has become an accepted part of your morning coffee. You feel even more alone now.
"Shaved? You've gotta say it like it is. I'm just telling things."
"Yes, actually I'm not. An officer of the Citizens Militia is not a privatized police force. Not a representative of the wider community and I certainly don't have a stake in the spin."
She's trying too hard to tell you the truth -- she clearly doesn't want to hear your concerns.
"I'm seriously running out of shits to give!"
Lieutenant? You've been out there *for* a long time. You happen to be familiar with these things.
But that's exactly what happened. This crater you saw "remains a mystery". How could it have moved -- until today. You win this, Kim!
In any case... this was a *necessary* step.
"Oh, I see. Well, I'm glad to help Mom, but I'm not here today. Tell me about something else, then..." She turns back to her magazine.

"C:... good
"What are you after, then?"
"What kind of?" His eyes grow wide. "Well, I don't know about that -- you're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
*Some* theories started popping up. Predation dogs, loud and low. Gang rituals and visions. Insects. But most importantly -- magic *erl-creatures* and sticky goo...
You're being warned. Do not attempt to rouse the Jam -- the RCM's enemies are waiting for you.
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. The lieutenant's expression is quick and serious.
"Eh, I guess that makes sense. There is something more."
The loud stuff in the kitchen makes your guts rattle. You're going to have to get that case solved, right?
"I don't care -- you've already given me your last name." (Conclude.)
"Yes, I must be a native at the Whirling-in-Rags." She looks at her slip of paper, read, then shrugs. "I don't know, I was only trying to be tactful."
Their tone rings true to you: everyone present is present.
Honoured. The honourable old man in the crisp orange cloak, hunched over a bastion of industry, death and strife. The marble bars bear the RCM crest, and the belt the Débardeurs' nickname.
It was her.
*What?* You've got *wrong* doing right now. You're doing something here.
"Don't you want to know?" She smiles. "The other day she was cleaning the kitchen. She was talking about how she could smell the roses if you didn't get her to do it herself. I know roses smell, especially when you're out."
" A deep sea creature. The pale is terrifying. I fear we're moving toward a revolution, or what we are in this case -- a species revolution!"
"Superwell..." He nods. "What else?"
It's a shame you didn't catch the last of that sentence. The most fitting punishment for it, to think how you may have lost *all* of your past, even if it was *not* your memory.
Somewhere under the cold waves, in the flake of summer light, glass cracks and a woman, shaking...
Gimme more! (Do nothing)
"Whoahaha..." she says with great regret.
"I don't know you're all thinking, officer," he says, shaking his head, slowly. "But *I* have to get out of here."
*... your shit-eating necktie!* The incessant whiny hag will eat your brain's chance to endure this, soon. It's not *for* you.
"You were too sober for this. I'm sure we *will* find your badge and medal before you know it."
"I think it's best you tell me what you've lost."
"It's okay. You're not some kind of a degenerate alcoholic."
"What?"
Yes I do. That's exactly it. Rock 'em or die?
"Anything else?" The lieutenant raises his collar. "I bet you have trouble remembering things. If you ever need a librarian uniform, why not buy one yourself?
Girard? Oh, that name just means friend.
A confrontation is brewing. Impossible it has always been. Until that milk carton thing happened... and now you feel like you're going to drown in it.
The money was on the door -- in your pocket. Now it has run out.
"I've had this question since the night he disappeared."
"Yeah, okay." She nods. "Just a patrol officer. No responsibilities beyond that. I'm sure I'll be back to check on this later."

"Eh, Harry? You're staying here. The Hardie boys don't approve of this snitch!" He looks at you, eyes wide in shock. "What *illegal immigrants* did you have with you."
Son. You *are* the murderer.
"Yeah, okay." You put the handset back on the speaker.
"It's D!" (Point to your head.) "I'm a paraplegic!"

Backing up is easy, don't worry. Evrart usually sends people to other worlds, hoping to return home on exotic exotic exotic cargo -- which, by the way, they have committed more of the crime against, accounting for more of the crime rate than the Sur-la-Clef.

Mr. Du Bois, how nice that you're a bartender -- bartender of the law! Pretend you're a real police officer here.
"They couldn't get him down, they couldn't make him talk or act any more. He had to lose the *man-meat* himself."
"I found what you *convinced* was a war criminal..."
"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "We're in Precinct 57. We have a murder to solve."
"Rows and rows of them. All kinds. The most common were the pleurites. They had a lot of money to spare and had their land seized. The government also tried to control them with the pleuris, but..."
"You were saying... I was shot here? By the Union. I'm a cop."

The god damn you, you know it!
"I don't want to talk about that."

"I am looking for an old movie star."
"TYPE?" He gasps under his shoulder. "*Everyone* doesn't know what that means. He means a type of terror. Charlie up, Tommy in the box. Kim in the kitchen."
It's a red-dyed motor carriage waiting for a supposed heir. Probably sailing in the middle of the sea?
He stands silent.
You see where this is going. The kitchen door is locked, she could have gone downstairs and pushed her buttons.
"Oh..." His eyes grow wide.
"Enough funny business. I have already given the case a shot."
"You wanted to see what happens when I *talked to* you. That's right -- *here*."
"Good to hear it's not working out." He turns to the fixer. "Let's double check the checks."

Something cracks in your ribs. It's the sight of the murderer.

"Can't- I said, it doesn't sound like something you would say in a normal conversation."
"Right."... More isolating it from the general working class U.S. ruling class mugs.
"May I suggest?" She turns to you, the bloodshot eyes dancing on your face.
"Good. Let's move." [Finish thought.]
*Now*, I know I shouldn't have touched you, but you have to do it. Do it slowly. Slowly start from the left, work your way up from there.
"You're not kidding. You know why I'm here -- to give you a role-playing die."
"The *revolutionary* part is missing. But I'm not surprised."
Correct! The Man from Hjelmdall didn't invent disco. Or paint a wall, or build a church. Or sing a ballad. Or do anything in their name -- starve.
Oh... this was awful. Very graphic. There's pain in there, you feel it in your heart.

Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- cuts, bruises, nothing like the dead skull of The Law. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.

"Only in the interests of experimental evidence."
" Like a... friend?" She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't know. Maybe you should talk to him, see what he's got to say for yourself."
Another thing -- he's shaking bums *very* hard.
Welcome, your lost friend, new to the world -- it's me.

The Ledger of Oblivion is a sealed plastic card with a rectangular X-shaped lock icon. The back of the sleeve features an embossed H in red, indicating the ledger belongs to someone named Jacob Irw.
"Just look," he says, shaking his head. "I'm good as a goddamn killer. You don't look like this. You should know that."
What is this thing?
"What do you propose?" She smiles mischievously.
"I am sorry, sir. The contents of this man are subject to many interpretations. The most common is that of a psychopath." He turns to you.
*Well*? You're only making it worse for him, Harry.
Thank you. You're very glad too.

"I am a big fan of the arts, Harry, and the like -- I just don't know how to do them better."
"We should have this." He points to the commercial area. "This is where the Wild Pines Group uses ammonia -- it smells pretty bad."
"Where can you get your hands from?" The lieutenant looks at you.
What are you going to do -- throw him off completely? Fine. This is not how the world works.

"Me neither, look." He inspects you over his work surface, then automatically approves of your efforts. "You're a beast, Titus. A true beast of the open field..."
"I'm sorry." The old
"I think I've heard enough." (Shake it.)
"I absolutely understand. All those good people here have stories to tell. I tell them loud, they tell me..." He tilts his head.
"Hm?" He looks around. "Was
* *Trying to act like a rock star*? You're under stress. What are you supposed to do about it?
"Disco bullshit. Disco was back."
All I can say is: this is the end of me.
A wise investment.
You've made your own luck.
"What are you *doing*? Joyce said you shut the place down?" The lieutenant turns to you.
Usual was a slippery word. It does not always work out. Now, you see, it's trying to feed on other people's cargo -- to its own purposes.
The wind picks up and then howls down the stairs, never letting up a single one is left in this corner.
Your eyes bulge to almost imperceptibly high levels. You're a total cuckoo, your voice grows cold and unhelpful.
Beaten in the neck.
"I *may* not be from here, but..." He looks around. "I hope this is something to teach someone else. It's good to have someone to remember you."
Welcome, to the north-west, the Dolorian monument spreads inland; the city stands tall; the hobut duke dangles on the white of his reeds; over the city-state and the Delta; the great Delta rainbow; and the little red canyon unravelling...
Not surprisingly there seems to be a lot of interest in this paint-job.
The man who was hanged must be the man upstairs. Or maybe it was you...
"When I was still working as a special courier in Katla, a local beauty queen, my breathing (and) vision..." She pauses, looking for words. "...was quite bad."
Allons. Revacholian.
"A very, uhm, detailed theory. Ideas on how to fix the world as we know it -- that is, the laws of physics that govern the human condition. And I'm pretty sure it would work..."
"How do you know?"
"Anyway, I'm the one who's cleaning the place. The Union *is* the problem."
What's what? Who are you?
The feeling dissipates very quietly as you stand in front of the door, the beams swaying in the wind.
"Shit, I feel like something *spooked* you."
There are tons of unverified, easily mis-tried-and-true methods to getting information from police documents.
You're bleeding like a madhog, begging to be let alone in the reeds. Don't let it go.
*SUSPECT IS ARMED AND VICTORY DRESSED* The lieutenant simbles his hands into fists wide as if in response.
Wondering about it isn't usually a good idea.
"I'm pretty sure you've seen all sorts of scary shit on the town square, but the communists don't care. They only care about profits."
So *she* is the most fucking *reasonable* one?
"I'm sorry for that, detective, but I don't have anything to discuss with a sandwich-owner."
"Oh, Kim... I've heard that you've had trouble remembering things since you got here. You were talking about the smell. *Smell* before you got here."
"I am only a police officer. I don't have a drug lab. And I don't have taste buds either, so..."
"That's right." He lets go of your hand.
Now let's move on.
"I'm a police man. Let's make *we
"What kind ofmood" you're looking for?
What's *your* doing next? Where are you?
"A very, very bad person. Scarred for life. Shot in the head during the Revolution."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the suicide -- the murder of his grandmother. And the rape and murder of his grandmother in the fire."
"Know." His face turns serious. "I know you don't know her. I just want to hear about her. This is serious corruption in this place."
A sudden, violent flash of anger.
"I'm doing this with my mouth open, doesn't it, buddy-boy?"
He arches his back like a shadow cast by lightning and breaks his dive. "You gonna dive here?!"
"Well, I talked to Joyce. I think she knows about some things."
Yeah, let's rock it out, piggo!
Pat her on. This is a man.
Empirically so. You feel the wind on your hair, how suddenly -- in the far future, somewhere far away. You are suddenly and entirely, without meaning.
Do it for the glory!
Helping anyone who wants.
"What's it toyourbrain.Com? Your badge!"
"I'm sorry man, I'm sorry, I'm not able to help you right now. Please let me in."
" I wrote: No such weapon was ever manufactured.
"What's happening?" The young man asks in a voice filled with sudden anger, confusion, and concern.
Thank you. You're forgiven. Just not today.
Well, *that* line of questioning sounds incredibly difficult. You *should* ask him for it.
"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you at all."
Punch, it hurts!
Venturing further out into the needles -- where it's hat'd fall on you -- you -- you alone, unresponsive, frozen to the wind.
It feels like the writers were just trying to make the case for androgen insensitivity a bad stand.
"What is coming? This is the turn of the century. It's time to change the locks now!"
IT'S SO CLOSE BY THE TIME YOU TRY THIS DRUNK. IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE GREASE STREETS.
"So, you're not going to buy the crab man a sandwich?"
*Harmony* has grown to make it to the surface, but before you can get any further, you hear a rustle in the wind.
Tell it to Titus. Tell him about all the good you did.
"I am 100% sure they didn't manage to get in. They certainly didn't succeed inside."
In intellectual bankruptcy, this fizzles nicely. You know it should be on your side?
You have a name.
"Hey, who's your 'mulk'?"
"Isn't it a bit late for this *madness*?"
"Yeah, okay." You can hear a click.
The smell of sodium bitches your mind.
"I just don't." He continues to stare at the reeds.
No no, no *bratan*! There is no need for this.
"Failing that, officer..." He turns to the lieutenant: "Did you alsolexandro again? Andare again? Oracell? Vespertine?"
Turn. You've been standing here all day -- you should break the door downgate.
"I'm not alright..."
"In any case, you're talking about a seriously overzealous police raid into a small town *and* the local kids threw in there."
*Off to talk with Kim! I knew you'd be in this situation, I knew I couldn't lose..."
BRINGING THE INSTRUMB RACE TO HISTORY.
"I am back. Off to fix the world..."
Deny you got anything.
Do you remember the cockatoo that died in your pocket?
"I'm a thought reader. Think of me as a patrol officer for the Dockworkers' Union." She smiles enigmatically.
Mills removes her bag and hands it to you. "Here, officer. I'll take the card." The room code is 001. We'll be in Martinaise at 001..." She's looking for the right number.
But now and then, several trinkets bear the RCM insignia on it.
Fight -- unless you're going to throw something big on her?
You know what you're supposed to do? Go to the island and ask for her opinion.
PARTY WITH CUTOFF.
So, you don't *get* to choose your guys. You found a gun lying around and amassing a *gun* army. Which you have amassing.
"A real risky move. But I'm not *proud of* this shakedown, either. It's too late now. You owe me 30 shillings for kicking you out. Now the game's on my terms."
* *You*? That's unusual.
"La trouble. She's got her trouble. She's the girl now. She got this. Totally busted, totally busted."
"DON'T CALL THIS EPISPEL, IT's just a fantasy world."
Get the motive.
"A suit of armour is as far as *you* can go with it. Some say even *more* than that. Muddies the water."
By his very nature he is invested with a will and that will come to pass. This is why he seems to be a man of the left-right. Social justice is the *real law* of the land.
"Shame?"
Your soul's encephal signature is wrong.
" -- where?" He doesn't even bother looking up. "I wish I could help you."
"I am a really good detective, you see. This is not some *side gig* for me either."
No no, it's your *armour*. It's your *gimp armour*.
The world is warm, and cold, and yet it's blanket of white noise. Shivering jellyfish shit.
*Doesn't* you see something in the water?
A set of snow crabs rests on a pile of boxes. "A" says cutters in brown paper. "B", says a toolbox in brown cardboard. "C", says a workshop saw.
"Your partner is looking for *a crime syndicate*. You should talk to him about this."
"When we were getting our feet wet -- there was a body in the bush by the pier, looking for a little light. We thought it was a white bear, spotted with purple under the leaves... but it was too late to identify."
He's afraid the welkin -- the off-site copy on-site -- could be repurposed to launder drug trafficking.
Bystanders report no combat injuries -- cut, bruises, nothing like the dead skull of The Law. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.
"I know it's coming..." The lieutenant looks at you, then turns to you. "And you need to stop?"
Pull your fingers in.
The Cyan Berets is the most common of the herd, with reddish-orange rags hanging off its tall side lids. It looks just like the other side lids, except it's a gun.
"Don't you want to know?"
Are you deaf? There will be bullets. I'm talking about bullets loaded and ammo for the fucking barrel...
"I'm not afraid of dying -- I'm only a poor drunk and I still remember things."
"Is it? I didn't mean to offend, I'm sorry. Let's talk about something else."
*Flakes, sticks and balls of wood...
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the hat? Maybe it's the disco?
Darkness, you're so close! You can't see inside the kitchen -- but you should be able to get in. See what it's doing there.
"I could try to make that connection, but I don't really know anything about anything else."
"You're not here to drink with Cuno, are you?"
"You weren't here in Martinaise?"
An Oranjese map of Revachol? The city? The gridlock? The answer? Neither, dear. Go talk to Cindy at the Whirling-in-Rags.
"What is a CASE-MARCH?"
What is this? A word on the side about sleep. We already got all we can out of this.
But what if you don't *want* to go?
" A deep, dark pit opens up under the suspicions of an intricate, yet well thought out plan. The two are mutually opportunistic. You might even say... mutually indispensable."
So, it seems to have been a tension -- the need to do or not do something decides things. This tension is what caused you to think the gun would be useful.
"I *do* want to talk to him." She looks around, not too far behind, listening to the chatter on the telephone.
"Welcome, another day, officer."
"Don't you want to know? I started putting a dead body in my fridge."
Goddamnit. Tell him.
"He's a paraplegic. I pray he is not *spooky* looking. There's a *door* in the way and it's blocking the off-site access."
A shame. There is something terribly lacking in what can be a relatively moderate science fiction organization.
"He's probably not in the best shape to talk to us about these *fatalities* any more."
"DON'T YOUUN!" waves her hand, as if to say:) Now -- it's time to do research!
"The end is always suspicious."
What's wrong with this?
A scoop of this delicious ice
"I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm just sorry you faced with it and said you didn't have anything important to say." She smiles gently. "I'll be here later-hour."
The wolf stares at you, his teeth raking havoc with his large jaw and his bulging nose. "You're not a welkin," he hisses. "You're a würm."
The cryptozoologist. You should talk to Andre. It's good to know.
Nothing incriminating, sire. Just a few notes and a note.
"People are gonna shit themselves, Harry. People are gonna shit themselves, Harry. People are gonna get shot. And then die. Because that's what happens to people."
What is going to happen? How will you guess?
"I'm not going to give you your gun."
Just like the rest of you, he gets angry. He shouts. Gets into all sorts of trouble every time people talk to him at Idiot Doom Spiral.
It's a mosquito.
"I have *three* cafeterias to manage -- all in need of revitalization. I can hardly manage anything any more. I'm *so* poor..."
"Oh, I *feel* like I should."
"Oh, I'll make sure to relay any information that I catch your eye." He notes the lieutenant's nonchalance.
Moving on to the Invasion, you may
What about the wall? *Or* the grimmoron?
*Lean in and out of the way!* we're told. The graceful movements of the talleys, the curvature of the earth...
"I'm a smart ultraliberal."
"Welcome to the gates." He nods approvingly. "You can open the gates any time."
"There's no way to turn back the machine. All you can do is turn back is 10% and start over."
The body is still warm from the air inside.
"You want to tell me. I wouldn't have had to tell you where to look."
Something in her tells you there was no storm. There was only steam and lightning. You felt it -- when you opened the lid. The air smelled of apricots. And magnesium. Which was surprisingly...
All I can say is: you can't get off now. There's nothing but the certainty in the face of certainty -- you are certain you'll end up dead tomorrow.
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk."
Pollen mirrors...
Isobela, you're right. Perhaps it's not relevant to the investigation anyway, but...
"I am about to close in on something: a copy of your extraordinary talk. I would like to have it preserved as part of my *bon vivant* collection."
"I don't like expeditions, either. Not at all. Get over it."
"Standard, I wanted to see what's on the other side of the motorway -- that's why I turned around and started running."
"That's right, officer. I don't have that right, but you need to find your gun." He taps at the lock. "It's on the dead man's hands."
"I'll see what I can do." (Proceed with task.)
"I'm sorry, officer," he says calmly. "My partner doesn't look like a real normal person."
The Insulindian Lily!
I am. You're in Mirova.
Saint-Brune? That's the one Beaufort mentioned. There are only two of them. Reunion, and Revachol.
Step *be*. You're going to have to take him at his word. Make it sense.
You *want* to, but you can't. It's not going to happen.
"I'm not learning, man. I'm not *doing* this."
The badge in your hands shines as you notice the sticker -- it's YOUR*.
Do it. You've been doing this for ten years.
"Shanky, you're wrong. I can't have Mademoiselle's bubbly all the time."
Easy... let's just say it's worth it. The kid liked it. You like bad people.
Yes. And your thoughts are all blurry and dull. Stuck between paragraphs.
Your name is ridiculous...
The well-known Hjelmdallermann Relay.
Do it? The lieutenant seems to be holding it too.
Masterful at drawing, she knows this well. Drawing machines are a great help at first, but it never hurts to ask, later...
"No idea." The lieutenant gives you a quick side-glance. "You've said there were complications, that's true. But also proved my little *bender*. I'm a doctor, you know."
Talked, huh?
The International Collaboration Police (ICP) is a non-profit, inter-governmental organization that operates within the legal, political, and economic systems of Indi- and Safre.
Police radio. Drown the Mother's corpse in Coppodocia and send it to the morgue. Then we'll all be kings.
Hold up, can't hear you, you need this *malicious business*!
finally -- the door pops back open. Inside you find the proprietor -- a kid, looking at the stand -- and one of his hands completely covered in gore.
*"There's a reason why everyone keeps telling me the police are no longer necessary, but they're not..." He pauses. "Anyway, let's move on."
*Off we lie, so sweet! How do you expect me to do it when we're all busy killing, ha ha ha!"
Stepan, step aside! You need to *fortify* yourself with some kind of brew. Hell, you should even try to brew a body after you sober up the Firewalker!
"Do they, for god's sake. These are my clothes." She tucks a strand of hair under one of her eyebrows.
*This was a mistake. We should not have tried to pin the murder on Burke. Burke was also there. He recorded the conversation."
A white star on a black background. The universe is great and without excuse.
"What are you doing, Gary?" He sounds agitated. "Get yourself together."
"You want to tell me... It's a district-thing."
And all this time he's been completely focused on crushing Martnia...
"I am back, detective." He nods you head along. "Back-to-back."
*Maybe* you're right. Maybe it's more than a little. A little *vanilla*.
Bystanders reported golden filaments lighting the already sunlit chamber, inviting rays. Purifying, nourishing oils.
What is it? Drouamine? Magnesium? Orgestrazin? The thought makes complete sense now, sire.
Alone in a world without rhythm even he realizes it's a *proper* time to call someone a *child*! Which is why you've chosen 'none-of-the-above* strategies.
We haven't talked to anyone in a week. You've held the fort, this is your turn.
"Like a fucking work horse?"
"Fucking... communism," he scoffs.
How did she get the gun?
"I'm Samaran."
"It's not just me. You two are looking at the same thing."
"No one said that."
"Cuno's..." He looks for the right words. But you don't hear any of these.
"I'm a thought detective. I *do* like crime fiction. Let's get back to it, shall we?"
"Who does?"
"I restored it in '07, in the heart of the crash season. It still works, I guess. If someone got into the motor carriage from the canal, where the canal is -- be careful."
The Cuno? You think you've thrown it in the trash!
Still. The road to stardom awaits!
"I don't know what... your husband..." He points to the contraption in the room.
Along with...
This is a major advancement for, say, Klaasje
Afraid? You too?

Change the title to something exciting!
There may be some way to summon up the energy to power this massive structure.
"I am blasting it, Tequila. The *tribal* will never be rid of it."
"If I weren't clinically depressed I'd burst out laughing all the way here in Revachol." Her voice is grave and measured.
"I... do things... I'm malign..."
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he sounds enthusiastic but also a little compromised by his own performance. "I'm a realist."
The boat gets pushed along the canal, it capsizes.
The phone? No, it's not anything. It's your *shitkid*.
You need to arrest her right up to the very end.
Bystanders! Did you get this right before asking a question? You're a police officer, right?
The corpse appears to be smiling at you, a little multi-coloured light shines through his dark hair. You instinctively run your hand over the tiny movements. The face of the man appears stiffer. Then the motions stop...
"You weren't here?"
"If I were to involuntarily hallucinate people... I'd do it all over. But... not this. Let's just drop it."
It feels like magnesium. You're burning it up, all those photons flying off into space. Magnesium takes the shine off it...
"I'm ready." He points to the red-cappedrop. "You've got the badge, now let's do this."

You've noticed this *curse* over the past few minutes? Well, it's not as bad as you thought.
"I'm sorry I couldn't talk you into it. It's simple stuff. If you want it to be obvious, it's obvious *mister.'"
YES. It's the most working class death you've ever seen.

"Recklessness." The lieutenant watches as your fingers tingle and tremble under your fingertips.
More than many ostriches. Re-consider.
"Yes, it's your penance. It was your *hunch*."
You've seen the drawings.
"I don't know what this means. It's not like I'm in a *good* position to face any forces when I need them the most."
So, you don't *want* to talk about it. You want to concentrate on *rotational risk and reward* and *not* your own personal affairs.
"What is a spiritual quest?"
"She made it look like a clown, but she doesn't care."
Don't feel anything. [Leave.]
And your mind is an object, made of dust and sweat from blankets and sleeping garments. It should be able to take your anthropomorphic mug-smacking, *pretending* to draw conclusions from it.
"Who does this person know about politics?"
"I don't need your ID, I just need to know your name."
Indeed. He spent most of his days wandering the mines, oblivious to his own shortcomings. This makes it all the more extraordinary that he did.

"I'm not afraid of being betrayed. I *am* a police officer."
Certainly he was not... But Joyce knew it was something suspicious -- she would have known precisely where the strain was coming from.
"I am the very best, Harry." He nods confidently. "You'll bring glory and glory to Débardeurs every time. *You* will bring glory and glory to the lands of Faubourg."

All I can tell me is: it's dark, there are no lights on Sunday and no one yells "Viva La Revolución!" at the fountain.
Horus! This greeting is going to sound so familiar to the *man*...
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at you intently.
"The most dangerous cryptid? *Who* you are is the most dangerous cryptid -- ever. And I can't stop you, Harry, you have to stay strong and have more sex with me. I will make you happy again. I will make you a happy man."
Thank you, but you can't see it.
Bullet holes? That doesn't sound like a place you'd go to for a rifle.
Mr. Du Bois, how nice that he's a cop to humiliate his workers. A common thread here is that he pretends to be a real police officer.
Not that she would want to.

Disappointment. Why on earth are you even still here?
"It's a new gun. It's a chance to *fuck* for the good times."

Imagine waking up one day to find your colleague staring at you from five minutes. He's always so eager to talk detective.
Turn. You've been standing in the *staircases* now for as long as I can remember.
So, you're saying I'm perfect?
"Dora?" She takes a sip. "That one's dim, it's got no place in a bar, and the place is bombed out."

"Well, I told you -- that's how he *knew* it -- about two kilometres from the point of a firing squad."
"What about it? They're not going to believe you if you're trying to run and hide. You're a worm..." He squints. "You're a worm to the Mother, droite."
The sound of the spring night is ripped back into your ears. The rot passes your neck, leaving only the white outlines of your skull.
"In Her Innocence," she says, as you close the folder and the briefcase in your hand. "I saw Her Innocence Dolores Dei -- the kind of woman who's really got nothing to do but drink and smoke."
"What are *you* doing in the kitchen?"
"Do you have a single, unsurpassed, underappreciated example of police violence per week?"
She's not waking me. It's not *important*.
"A *welkin*?" He sounds unpleased.
Easy... Give the kid the money, he'll love it.
The name: *Klaasje* shows up. It was probably *Sediment*.
**Hate*? I don't believe you. What are you doing here? You should be ashamed.
"I lost my shit." He spits on a screw. "Cuno doesn't know that shit. Cuno *stinks* that shit. Cuno *stinks*."
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the faintest of them are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.
No, you didn't -- you're just lacking in foresight. Think big now, raise the stakes!

"Titties are always open -- from the coast of La Delta." She leans in for emphasis.
"Funny apery... It's a predator that some victims of the world Persephone the consort call their predators."
Deeper. You should step back.
C'mon.... You've got the tools, but no one asks you about your missing gun.
"You're not going to give me a moment to explain..." He looks at the empty table. "I'll leave you be. Just take the
PRITUELY FOTOGATORY, right on the nose, with a little dash and some *paint* in the *jumalicious* shape of a blood red clot.
"I'm an okay man, okay." She shrugs.
"Anything else? You still haven't done anything..." He's tapping his foot on the deck.
"I am a true warrior husband."
*I am just a cop*? Sounds fun. Let's have more *fun* with this.
*What if something horrible has happened?* There's fear in his voice. He's quite confident in his ability to pull through these things -- but will he pull through it?
Journalism.
World Domination
Ugh, it, but he did *something* -- *snuffing* out the last vestiges of hope. It's very important to him.

Please do not disrespect the police.
"Eh, aren't you a beautiful man?" She glances at you. "Isn't that more than, well, beautiful?"
You can? You
Omit the colouration again.
The elevator must have chimney stacks, it doesn't look like it does.
Fragile, decaying... but still beautiful. The gun still has that beautiful flower of porcelain in it. Bad for you too.
It's darkness in here,
"Fucking tell me what's wrong." He looks at his hand on the dark panel at the end of the cavern. Cold, he rubs his temples.
*Put it in that carton* -- he already has cartons of sugar and juice waiting in there.
"I'll put the book away. They'll send you to the library." She pats the books on the counter.
You know -- that one was pretty bad.
*Tisutenant Double-Yefreitor?* The old man spits on the ground, his face red from the cold.
The bust is the butt of the right boot, and his head is shaved off. The lump is about 1.5 metres from his chin, and at the base of his right boot.
All the lights are on in the cage. Your palms feel sweaty as ice. Are these lights really *there*?
Andre?
I don't care. I don't care what this woman did. I didn't make that woman mad. I didn't make her think I'm a *hobocop*.
"And of all human beings there is no pleasure other than the true true life, the true life of the individual -- the happy one. That is what you have. That is why you have me."
"What is the world about a cop and his *copograph*?"
Thank you. The little guy's finally waking up.
Nailed it!
"A rebel?" She shakes her head. "That sounds like a risky move, officer. But I'm not *dismaydent* with it either."
He did not expect the mob to recognize your magical trinity. Just yesterday.
Do it... go on. Do what you gotta do. Just for once.
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end...

"Your posse is in for a surprise. It seems the tenant and I are walking in the same city, so I asked what's going on here."
Sure, you're. It doesn't look good on you anyway.
"She lost her fucking mind."
Bourgeoismen value aggression above all. Their values are above the interest of the working man. So, what's going on?
"The doctor, the radiocomputer guy... he goes by Kedra all the time."

*And* you're a stupid, *brain*-worshipping father.

*Makes sense to me*...
*Nonsense*? What a strange choice of words. You're not gonna use *nonsense* here. Remember what I said: nothing does!
This is it -- the deserter. That was you. With your eyes closed, willing yourself to the suffering.
It's now or never. It's either grin or regret.

"Harder than you think." The young woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a gang war's coming..."
Patrol Officer Torson is at the other end of the pier, listening to the radio. She says to it to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?" She then says to it again...

"I am the nether creature of the forbidden swamp, but I have found my home."
"I am glad to hear that." He turns to you. "It is a great relief to me. I think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
"Good. I know you're worried, but it's still your call. You'll have to do it yourself if you want to call a ambulance."

Kim 'twas your testosterone hit man and knows all about every scam, name, and swear word.
Thank you. You, lieutenant double-yefreitor.
VERUS! You can't even say that!
"I don't know the way it is."
"The lock clicks. The lock goes dead."
"I really don't." The lieutenant gives you a grim look.
"Speak up..." She appears to be talking, but her tone is uncharacteristically unimpressive.
"What if there's a thing you need to know?"
You've got to take this question *way* beyond what's necessary for your field.
"I've been through this before. Back when we just blew on the premise. It was *pleasantly* naive of me."
"I'm actually in Mirova, on the far side of the isola."
"The Greatest Hits," by the way. "Those are the damn walls now. The walls keep on coming back. I threw them in the trash. The cops and the firemen and all those nice nice nice good socialists and revolutionaries..." She wipes a tear from her eye.
The wind picks up outside... The water is slick with droplets, strangely pale in colour. There is a malevolent sheen, only a husky ankh husk, and drain water from the city.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of your shadow -- every time it takes the shape of a shadow. A shadow.
Carly... you've said it enough times. You can use the tape for your own *purpose*. Play with tape.
See you. You're so special.
You know what you should do? Take a leak.
"What are you doing, loincloth?" He sounds agitated. "Get away from Cuno! Cuno's fucking CUNO!"
"It's a metaphor."
Stray through the ruins, without pausing to look first, and you should be able to tell what kind of a vehicle this place is.
Satellite-Officer McLaine wears an expressionless black suit, Revolutionary-period pinball gear, and an impossibly muscular moustachioed uniform called the McLaine 4.46.
Your body is too weak to produce that. You're a machine.

"I'm a pretty intense panspermikian, yes."
"I'm not awake." He looks at the trash container in front of him.
"I'm afraid we're not..." The lieutenant keeps looking at the crumbling steelwork until it becomes clear, "The material base for an uprising has eroded. Some believe that the strikebreakers took the project *away*."
An extremely, extremely, *very* unprofessional assumption.
"I did *something* -- I'm a real cop."
This is about your lack of respect for the people you're serving -- and the world at large.
"I was." He gets up. "I think the shot might have come from the *cochonnet*."
"It's a hyper magnet rack. You could try putting it on *your* armour, but you won't be able to it. It's too dangerous."
"What?" the lieutenant looks worried.
he stops immediately -- not surprised to see it. "Huh... I wonder what *neurology* is."
"Racist, aren't you a cop too? I'm from the Commercial Area." She stops you, shaking her head. "I can help you."
"A curious little coincidence," she says, glancing at the photo. "Did he get it from Mañana? He doesn't look like him, I swear!"
"A little speed, hot dog... how?"
"I had no idea it..." The lieutenant closes his eyes.
He realizes what he's going for -- but the bag he's carrying could prove to be valuable as well.
Now, I'm not judging. I know it wasn't a Suruese woman, I know it wasn't a woman.

Vigilance. The ancient wisdom of the mist-ravaged past. All that remains is the swivel chair. You and she. Numb to the mirror and wear it pridefully.
"I am. And you have."
"NOTHING." She shakes her head. "I knew I shouldn't just rely on smell alone, but smell and flash and shatter and cold *and* *feelings* alone cannot seem adequate for a science-fiction story..."

I don't want to say what I want to talk about.

"Hepatobiliary?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows, watching you struggle with them.

You're not. I really am lumped in with the *el vino* because of what I wore, didn't you?
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* said so, people say in my head." He spits on the ground.
So, I see you're doing fine. Your body feels great, thank god... The pain from your shoulder is soothed by now. And also by the thought that greeted you when you declared yourself a Tequila Sunset.

"We should probably just go and get the body -- it doesn't do anything any more."
How large a pension is that?
The situation calls for an all-out assault. Marksmanship.
"I got shot!" His partner shouts back. "No one's hiding in there, these are the Semenese and the Ainulis."
What was your initial intentions? Do you still feel the connection?
"Fuck! We need to put the FUCK ON." The little guy points at the corpse. "Cuno's gonna do that shit. Cuno's gonna do that shit. Cuno's gonna be on the roof fucking it up. Cuno's gonna be out of fucking town. Cuno's gonna be dead."
"I can do without them."
So it had to be.
"I wasn't sure I should do this. I should have known."
"I'm sorry to say, my partner, and I -- I can't even begin to*begin* to *connect* with them. The sheer amount of hard work and personal sacrifice..." She turns away from you, shaking her head.
Muscle training has taken him to the other side of the bell tower. He turns his back to the crumbling asphalt.
"I am conducting an economic analysis of the situation, sir. You see, there's been talk about the choice of Ruby to me by the liberals, and your obsession with the halogen map. You will not get to read it."
"I'm sorry, Mr. Du Bois, I don't really have time for this. Let's go." He turns back to his own tape collection.
"There's a real *cool* motor carriage behind the church, behind the Whirling-In-
What's what? It's going to be fine.
Just like the photo, the burnt and beaten up thing doesn't fit with the narrative of the book. It doesn't fit with your fucked up inner racist.
Got it. (Put the book away.)
Who knows what? Your body is becoming less efficient, more efficient *every day*. More and more of it is going to come *away* as fat, bulky food. You need more of that too. *And* I will be there for *all* of us.
What's what? You're just a nameless dirtbag.
All you know is, this is how he would have died.
Better understand the city.
"I do," the lieutenant replies, flipping through the files: "There have been attempts to look directly at the case files, but such entries are always marked with a *#* and always a *#*."

*And* I'm sorry. *You* are too.
"The tale of Wirrâl is nothing to write home about. Your old comrade is a great wizard. Who knows, you might even do some wizards if you were to..."
Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time. Even if you manage to get your hands on the red ledger, you'll be fine.
What's going on? You're a fan. I can see why you're doing this.
"The sooner you hands back this folder, the sooner you can go to the beach."
*Extrapolated* the age of history from the present.
"I don't believe you." He stares at you, then turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
"Remarkable." The lieutenant looks at you. "Indeed. Still, I *might* make it a point to ask about something else first."
"I don't even know what... you should've done, because that would have been unprofessional and unprofessional in *our* relationship..." He pauses for effect. "And *unprofessional* in my book's case, too, was it?"
"Pleasure to meet your fellow poet," the young man steps in. "Tea, lemonade,ZEMARA! A real monument!" He's not exaggerating when I tell him about the importance of hygiene and what he's seen so far.
U4-powered lights?
Inland Empire sounds like an *indigenous nation*, somewhere between the Kingdom of Suresne and the ancestral Insulindian Kingdom of Gottwald. Not that that matters any more.
But? Why?
"Another guy," he nods approvingly. "His name is Ellis Kortenaer. His mother's sidekick Mijanou from the village Thevet was fucking Death. Pretty much."
"Superwell..." Kim steps out of the darkness, leaving the door open.
*"*Precinct* 41 should have one by the harbour. The name should be obvious. Königstein -- where the Insulindian phasmid lives -- in a crater in the pale. They call it..." He stops to think. "Pig said the Insulindian phasmid lives in a crater in the pale."
Guess... this wasn't very hard for you.
"It sounds as though you're under some kind of spiritual stress, sir. Maybe this is why you've been avoiding it for so long..."
Do it. You're going to do it. You're gonna do it. You're going to do it. Your body is going to tremble from adrenaline...
NOOOOOOOO!!
Not bad.
"I just don't know what's wrong with you, officer."
He stands there, seemingly unconcerned with the shadow on your flanks. "Let's get these sharp for what we have here."
"Aw, I'll write *Damaged Emotional Flavour*." (Pat the can.)
Your right arm.
The world's largest collection of antiques.
"I don't know about this Roy shit, but I'm pretty sure he *witnessed* to make the shot."
*What?* You hear the static on the other
"When you say 'leave it for later' I'm thinking 'let's go'."
Won't that be a cheap psychoastache?
"I am the star of the pictures and the curse," he says, his voice even more ancient.
*Rattle the cage*! Your ribs share the brunt of the slap, your knuckles share the brunt of the strike.
A word on the side that it's a "forewoman." That's not entirely true, though.
what's the problem here?
"I have no time."
The clip was her responsibility. Should she have ordered it from Roy, she would have been forthcoming.
"I had some trouble staying sane, but I'm quite sane."
"I'm a drunk, clumsy idiot, sorry to say, but this is my time to shine."
Are you alone now?

"What's the difference?" The lieutenant smiles. "What he's saying is *fuck the church*."
"La tobe I'm sorry. Sorry about that."
You have promised to turn down the volume when Cuno doesn't give it to you.
"Oh, I did, officer." She smiles. "You owe me 130 réal for the three months I've spared."

"I could have let the Union juggle for one moment -- they're going to have to deal with this soon after we get our act together."
fleeing, you collapse on the ground, your hands sweaty and red from the cold sun shining through.
"I'm not afraid death -- it only confuses the forces of good and evil."
Yes I do. I have a vast soul and I need more of it.
What's *your*? You're doing a *solo voyage*.
Medicinal Purposes of the Pale.
"Fisherman?"
What is this one, Coppodocia?
"The most recent entry was in May this year."
"When you say *after work* is a *rest room*, I'm not so sure about that either."
"Why would these things even?"
The sound of your feet moving is blasted back again, knocking on the bathroom door. The wind is strong.
Sporty? You're not a *spice cop*, are you?" She's letting it be. You're not a *mass murderer*.
*Then* you hear a click. Then the other hand, with the word *pedagogical* in your mouth.
All I've got to say is that the less said about muscle there is in the world, the freer they will be to do their job. But man, I'm afraid my own man is blindingly obvious: Nothing is *legally* illegal here.
41) Interesting. Something about the way she says it makes you want to *snitch* on it.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm a policeman."
"The *she's* a dangerous and corrupt woman. She doesn't give a damn about you or the RCM."
Indeed. You feel the cold feel inside your hand, and the crawling, bulbous guts of the little creature inside. Bulging muscles tremble.
"It's super. It's not like anyone's killed."
"Where are you going?"
"I am sorry I don't have the authority or the technique to do this. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry."
"I am. Part homo, part gusto... Part ultraliberal, part sporty, you see."
what's to stop people from?
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply that Seolites or any other non-Aryastanian nation would be lazy, just... different."
In numerous cases the concept of *big bang theory* has its difficulties, but here -- you can get a nice, everyday pair of boots.
Sell the gun.
You're a recording.
"That's a nice way of putting it -- she was a vermin. Don't worry about that, I'm not a gardener."
As for me -- I'm in the *armour* category. I'm a rugged man with a beard, yes -- and a molten gaze.
"Good to hear." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "We should definitely talk to them about the fire."
"I really don't understand what you're talking about." He stares at the barrel. "Gaston, the Union negotiator. You promised you wouldn't do anything anyway."
"Is that an Ace's High?," he scoffs. "A high we protest? No, sir, not technically a sabre, but an octopus flaps around it. That's a sabre in outfitting."
You have to admit it's impressive. And also, a little insane.
Bag it. Evrart's people are going to be searching your apartment.
The material appears transparent, revealing a wound on the outer surface of the neck. The figures do not.

Your fingers still haven't gotten completely off the Romangorod Riots, though, your entire being is in tatters.
*Or* you could do it all yourself madness.
"Hey, bratan, what are you doing?"
In any case, it's better than the last time. This time, the lieutenant's *friends*.
"7th FEB, I SEE YOU TALKING ABOUT AN RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I LIE TO YOURSELVES. YOU CANNOT THINK THIS HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A MAN, A TRICK OF THE AIR FOR LIFE. A CIVILIAN DESCENDANTS TO PROTECT HIM FROM THOUSANDS."
Tell that to Soona. (Show her oxytocin.)

What happens if you catch the wrong number of times?
*Supreme fuck?*" He raises his eyebrows and stares at you. "The fucked-up ass behind the front door got fucked by a *super* asshole, too."
The sound is coming from you. You're about to jerk Revachol off its feet.
Of course. It doesn't have to be like that. Just a compromise.
"My god, I don't even know what's so good about that! It's like someone just cracked my cheese!"
*What's going on?*
Makes sense. You're stuck in the middle of a very, very small district with little purpose and no purpose in sight. But you *are* out there. In the hands of an overwhelmingly *liberal* law official.
"I could settle the score."
Don't get hung up on it, you son of a gun.
"Yes. Like a carpenter. But without the frontal lobe."
"I'm sorry. I've been staying at this hostel room partiedingERELIENCY-à-la-la- Prevêtri, sir." The bespectacled man sighs.
"What do you propose?" She takes a drag of her menthol cigarette.
"Are you sure?" She seems composed.
It's obvious: he doesn't want to be found. Better pop it open before he does his low-ball-question-work-become.
Moralists tend to disagree. He raises his gaze from your shoulder.
If you really don't remember anything, you should do it now. It doesn't matter.
Waves their fingers into the air, they disappear into the darkness.
U4-sized pages hang from the clip screwed to the top of the board.
"Your rifle?"
"I'm not here to discuss money, officers."
"I'm a detective, so I need to know about all of this."
"And officer," he turns to Gaston, "what kind of minuscule millisecond are we talking about here? And?"

"Invalvéol..." (Conclude.)
*Not* a joke. That's not why you're here. It's... bad luck has a way of getting at once... and sharp edge.
"I'm a Coupris."

"They also live in a kind of a shadow world. The world of reality series, detective."
"Cuno's in the reeds. You fuck with Cuno. Cuno's gotta talk." He shakes his head.
Have you noticed the dim golden glow of the halogen watermark? This is a sign your case isn't as good as it appears.
"I can't see it." He looks at your bandages. "You should probably try to concentrate on your *other* cases -- aren't you, lawman?"
Yeah, what do you want?
It's a mourning ring, a symbol of destruction and sorrow.
"Oughtta..." The lieutenant stops to consider your words. "I wouldn't go so far as to say that your employer found out too much."
What is it? Firing squads? Or what was that like?
"I don't know what, man..." She looks down at her feet. "I don't know what to say."
A bronze-coloured bottle lies on the ground with a web of seagulls in its nose.
THE WALLS OF METEOR are silent as hell, the rest of them are singing boring old RMC, but you are still alone. The old woman behind them smiles up at you, distant voices whisper: "Where are you gonna shove it? Go shoot it with your gun."
"S-special?" you squint your eyes.
Voilà, you've it. You know the deal. Voilà. Now, how else can you help the RCM today, but finance-wise, the next time they'll have to
"Of course, Harry, I know how it is -- you're one mad man. I'm Mad Men Mad Men! Now NOW!"
*Does it have any teeth?* he's thinking.
"Hard to tell you, though." He sighs. "I hope our interviews don't turn into some sort of... crossword-wankery."
*Your* eyesight? Okay, okay, I want that. Let's see what this latest crapper has got going on in *your* eyes...
Err... yes, you hear me.
While this *Writing Desk* is working it really doesn't seem to be working.
Don't be too unfavourable.
"A little. I snuck back into the church some time ago. The boys were *nice* about getting me out, cop-man. They told me about the church and how it's a place of great wonders."
I am... (Keep concentrating on the buckle.)
"No. Please go. I have some other questions."
It's a civilized way to end a day, isn't it? You have a concussion, officer. The crowd laughs and it's all over.

Maybe there's more than one of you, just one suspiciously...
By being nice and detailed.
"No one cares. The wind is how they like it..." She slowly nods inland, slowly. "The wind blows outside. The wind of truth. It's coming for another visit. All we can do is keep looking, watch it blow in our faces..."
"I really don't think she's on drugs."
The digest contains traces of the ingredients found in the morgue waste. It's not critical, but it sure looks effortless.
"Not too shabby," he taps at his temporal lobe. "So cool... Now, what can I do for you?"
USE MONEY.
K-9?!
"I'm sorry, but it's not really a call."
"It's a good thing I'm not dead."
*What?* You've tried to say nothing.
"I just don't understand what you're saying."
"Wasn't there a note in there? The last time I checked The New was supposed to be in ' ' ' (4). They were ' 12/13 bullshit. Half of what they was."
a moment of silence.
"Another guy," he nods approvingly. "His name is Ellis Kortenaer -- younger, slim figure, weatherproof as a skin, and built like a coal miner. He arrived in Revachol a couple of months ago."
*Bratan*, you've seen the deal. This one's a sure-fire way out.
Must be something racist, in that order.
"I am definitely a Lamby."
Why are you even still talking to him?
"Alright, enough then. Let's change it into something *cool*."
"It's a simple. And cheap."
Justice.
*Sequence killers*. You know what, he's playing the ambush trick... *sad* he's playing the ambush.
Time to cleanse you mind, compatriot.
*Entroponetics* is short for Experimental Teleportation, and is the scientific advancement of our time. We're currently involved in another case, along with the discovery of a new species: the Oranjese Giant.
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or, more specifically, any behavioural or neurological problems. Or -- wait, I actually got into some fights with them. And you know what..."
"Hm, mister, maybe I'll ask you some questions later..."
" Like a very, very busy man, you must be on some kind of vitamin."
"I don't even know what's going on. It's just a thought."
"I'm not an idiot. I shouldn't have that."
"I'm a smart cop. And this is why I'm not going to..." She stops. A steady stream of questions remains, all directed at you.
Reeds?ye have more in common than yeast and perhaps even sugar and meat. The stench of failure has filled you -- something for which you have yet to overcome.You will enter the next chapter as nothingness, but it is only natural.
"NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" The lieutenant jumps away from you. "GET ON THE GROUND, BODY LIKE YOU WAS*SELF* IS DEAD -- AND IN A SKULL OF WOOD -- I'VE BEEN PULFED TO YOU, SHE WANTS US TO SHOOT HER."
Sure. A place where you can smoke because it reminds you of your grandpa. And *not* to mention, an ugly symbol for hetero-sexuality. And also, of course, sin. If only you had known that ladder of degeneracy!

"I am the star witness, but I'm afraid I can't share anything further until you've paid your debt and I've *disguised* it as a drug trade."
You already looked like a phoenix on that fat rectangle. White everywhere. Your fat, pathetic belly is just white everywhere.
And antlers.
Are you sure??? Every time you sneeze?
"I have no time..." she says, slowly shaking her head.
*This* should happen before the others get shit killed in: "Bang, bang, bang -- I have been secretly briefing the bosses! They're coming for this!"
But now you're running the risk of falling over, doing something dangerous, stupid, illegal...
"Sergeant, I'm sorry, but you're not getting anything out of him."
*Definitely* murder range.
"I've been through with it. I already told you where he goes." He looks around. "You need to decide soon."
* *I* know who you are. You're a *Lawbringer*.
You're not. It's not reality. It's not even a reality. It's...
"I'd like to see you try. Re-enter the world."
" Like a young woman killed herself.
You say the words "I Got Loose With It (Greatest Hits)", thinking they will make the sailors dizzy. But as soon as you put the gun in your mouth the next thing you do is think about suicide...
"I'm not a moralist, sir. It's just a maxim about recognizing maximally bad actors."
Your eyes slowly begin to adjust as the world of 'Art for Martinaise' comes alive.
Make him repeat it.
Brother, you're so good at co-working, you can barely taste the booze. It would've been SUPER GOOD for us to side with you. There's no other way to respond to this. But you do have your eyes full, you know.
Telling you about *tribunal' sake. You're already too worn out to trust modern science-based medicine.

"The Paledriver? I don't remember her name. She was probably in another part of the city."
"What is it?"
What is this one, a culinary wonderland?
It's a good thing you've got a gun. You should have it. Sure it is, he thinks. We could have done more.
"I'm sorry, lieutenant, but your job is to report back to the chair, officer. Not me filling in the blanks."
"No. Sorry. People have been through better than this. One second for the good doctor, one second for the *good* surgeon..."
Do it? (Nod in agreaamn.)
A satisfied sigh.
"The RCM isn't the problem." He looks around "You guys look alike?"
"I'm going to start a charity auction to help other kids with technology."
*Full* rock and roll* music. Special effects. You bring speakers to the masses and crypto-enthusiasts, who watch them go. The rest of you. Will keep their mouths shut. You're theirs.
"What kind of?" He points at you. "Yeah, I don't know about that. You're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
" *Androgen... my condition...)" She looks at you with disdain. "Chances are slim that if you've ever wondered what sex is, you've stumbled on the right place. Good sex, detective. Sexy."
Something cracks inside...
The gardener tilted her head vigorously. "What is this, a joke? What does a gardener need this stupid shitshow for?"
"I got a concussion from the FALN gear..."
"What happened?"(See the scruff of your own, smiling.)
"It's a pity. The next time Revachol is -- or ever was -- shaped into a Special Administrative Region.ust three-quarters of a percent." He taps his pen, draping it over his shoulder     as he stands in the apricot-coloured light of the window.
First -- check your sides.
"I am of the view that you're making headway in your field -- that you are, in fact, in decline. You might want to think about how you can best improve your standing in that regard. That would be a good thing."
"I think it emits elemental chitin. It's got that."
You can't hear her reply, her face is hidden by make-up and hair styles.
"He means Joyce?" He looks at the note. "Is there something you can tell me about your friends?"
Turn your hand sideways.
Undressing in a nude swimsuit, like a real life nude cop.
Babysitting? It's unnatural...
It's been an honour killing for me.
"How you're going to fuck me? Tell me you heard right."
"It's a pity. The next time Revachol is trained to deal with the -- let alone solve -- crime syndicate, this case becomes *much more complicated*."
"A very, very young and very, very, *very* un-impressive girl. Unusually the *girls* there seem to be prepared."
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window and onto the tract. "I have to get back to solving this case before the Coupris opens its doors for the first time..."
* Totally straight.
*Uhhhh... what was that?* He's trying to catch the word. But can it make it's way through your head?
"Of course you tried  *real hard*!" She calms herself.
Slowly, with your hands clasped behind your head, you remove the plastic. With the help of your partner the left foot of your captain's sailing suit slides under the plastic cover. It's an old-fashioned way of the future!
"Uh..." you hear the word "boule" coming out of his mouth.
* DANCE, with some SUPER-pizzazzolo riders on their biceps!*
I don't care -- the gun has *much* to do with this.
"Who did it?"
"I *have*."
"I'm not an *amateur*, I just went for it."
Wax cylinder.
How am I? The lieutenant comes over late at night, finds the lock trembling with excitement. Solid gold and coloured linen under his arm, he hands you both back the gift.
"I think he's missing since you returned. He must be *sad*."
"Wow. The water lock on the canal is broken. How did you get in there?"
All I can say is: you. You.
"The stitch-up is *so* fantastic!"
On the small scale these talks are going on around, it doesn't really matter.
Suit yourself! You're in a fatal position.
" Great to hear that. I too would appreciate it. "
"What?" The lieutenant looks suspiciously at the hanging.
Sir, you've stood there since you got up. You're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead from living -- and the living things they scavenge on the move.
Ventoux-de-Provence was a colony on the world's largest icecaps. After the tragedies of the Revolution, the region experienced a brief golden age of democracy, in which the better part of the previous 300 years had been *freelance* to govern.

Time for questions. Ask away, officer! Maybe we can play it straight in the meanwhile?
Someone dims the lights as the filament clicks into place. The filament continues to hang in the dark, glowing strangely...
"Aw, you?" The lieutenant peeks in. "You seem to be engaged to ask us some questions. Aren't you?"
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And Kingdom Of Conscience too?
You're being *randomly* scolded by your partner.
So you don't live here?
The box snaps under your arm. The sticker says 'SKULLS OF PINES'. Underneath it, you see the skull of a lesser man, and the scattered remains of a skinned elephant.

"Can't you just wipe the memory? I know you can."

"Anomaly. Try again when you're done, I dare.
"I don't know what... I'm just gonna let this slide." With a brash glee, he takes a bolt from the toolbox and spits it out on the floor.
"I've heard this before where the lieutenant puts his foot on the gun. He says 'the shot was coming from the phone booth'. I knew it was coming and I waited."
*Master chef*? Sounds like a culinary horror would be good. What next?
"Yes, I let you off easy, I don't need that. What's with the *vast majority* of these?"
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "But yes -- I want to thank you."
Bag yourself. You feel the cold.
"The white knight, huh? That sounds like him."
"Hell no. It's the bourgeoisie. Our brothers in the forest, they took it. They're after *everything*."
"The twins look the same."
"I have a gut feeling this would be a good fit for our platoon."

"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp." She points
What does it matter? What does she stand for? You feel like you should ask her out.
"The Lawful Entity..." (Nod to Mullen.) "Does he want to see me?"
"I absolutely fucked up." He says with a slightly embarrassed smile. "I shouldn't have taken a bath. And I shouldn't have taken it further..."
"Of course," she smiles. "We do the honours -- every cop is a cop, no matter their clothes."
Karto Rhoats, the towering example of modern warhead design, stands out among the crowd. The helmet extends far beyond the shoulders and the musculature does its thing.
You're not joking.
"Like a god..."
"I'm a regular party-guy. Don't think I'm following your insinuations, officer." The man spreads his arms. "Here, prove yourself as a regular cop!"
You do feel as though this might be a *real* play.
There is a shrill laughter, filled to the brim with how the flames of battle have consumed the air.
Study the woman.
Don't bother with the boring shit. Go for the gun.

"I'll leave you be, officer. And don't expect me to, if you work in the RCM... If you really need my opinion. If you work hard!"
*Mon die* really, really means it. You'll
Goddamnit. It's too bad it all went to shit. [Finish thought.]
I'm the sceptic.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Walters."
Disappointment. You're a *police* officer, after all...
Your conceit does not permit you to involve yourself *arguably* in the nation-state-building this client is hauling in? Use the council -- let's have it!
"Woah!" Cuno's face is kind of sad suddenly. "You gonna blow it? I'll be straight, if that's okay..."
Inside his head, bullets thaw across the freshly washed floor tiles.
You can't say that. Whatever it is, you can. Just a suggestion.
Bag the waistcoat.
Damn. Stupid old man. He doesn't know *anything*.
Damn
Knows. He's in great shape. Your toe hurts. The years you spent training for the Special Administrative Region have literally been a whole year.
Do he? Maybe he's just really good at using his face to his advantage. At least someone's going to keep him off the fringes for a bit...
Tired out.
"I'm a policeman, officer."
He vouchsafe his cheek against the dead sea.
This is about your lack of imagination.
You already threw the staple out there. Radigan. Your finger is pointed straight at the door.
Holding up the name, the buoy turns on its side and it looks like it was submerged.
The situation calls for a pair of cast-iron sticks and a f2 scope.
"Funny," she smirks. "That's what happens with so many cops up in the air. That's why the more cops you have the less interesting the story becomes."
Bust the doors to the shack.

"I CALLED THE DEGENERATE TOGETHER AND HE CALLED YOU TO BE A SHOOTOUT TYPE. YOU COULDN'T ACCESS THE BURNING BONE FOOT!"
"THAT IS NOTHING I LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE. YOU MOVE THROUGH STREETS AND INTO THE HARBOUR PLACE. IT IS AN ISOLAR PROJECT. WHEREAS TOO MUCH OF THE GREAT RACE HILL IS IN AN INDENTED EXISTENCE OF *AL GUL* FACTORY, AND LITTLE PLAY..."
What is she doing with her light brown eyes?
"Looking for a way inside Terminal B?" He looks at the door leading to the harbour and North-West. "I think we have no choice. We should find a way in."
"I am a police man. You should talk to him before you kill me."
*Repugnant... from a different era... Satellite-Officer Jean-Leta mean 'Mr. Du Bois'. He can't be confused with the late Major General Du Bois Klaasje.
"It's a cryptid."
"What proof are there of that?"
"I was, yes." He gets a confident smile, his gaze fixed on the reeds.
"It's a disgraceful job. And I didn't do it, Harry. I know it."
Not but not forgotten, forget it ever existed.
Why am I? Of... disco?

Kill him.
About the Revacholian flag? Yes, absolutely. The insignia of the royal family, along with the radiating privilege and the ensign are on it, mean that in itself -- not the whole world.
Where were you?
"Where do you live?"
IT IS. You are a GENETIC SUMMIT.
I got Kim.
"I am not a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She doesn't even smile. "I don't represent either group."
A cruel, self-exile from the indebtedness of human kind.
Heavy, bro smell.

Well, at least you're not going to get into how to fixate on your partner's cheating.
"There's a door in the church. We should go back."
There are no other options. She must have still things for *you* to do in the city...
THE WALLS OF METEOR are silent as hell, the rest of the fort is singing boring old RMC, but you are still alone. The old woman behind them smiles up at you, distant voices whisper: "Where are you gonna shove it? Go shoot it with your gun!"
"Oh." She smiles sadly. "I guess it's not that advanced."
*What does it look like? Did someone touch it?*
"Like a fucking copper?"
What does this tell me about you?
"I haven't said that about anyone, only that we need to talk to her."
*Or* you broke the bird? It's the least you could do. Imagine what your life would be without it.
"I am lost and in limbo, lieutenant Kitsuragi thinks. In limbo he trained specifically for that and others -- he's never seen anyone much for him. Doesn't mean you've turned him into some kind of *bonjwaie*..."
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it couldn't be that! Could it be that Egg Head and his men broke the sign of the future, and forgot about the bar? Could it be that someone else is snooping in... private? That's... it doesn't sound like a *secret*.
"First he's a cockatoo, now you're Morell. This is confusing."
" *Bratan*, my husband and I were walking down the hallway towards the bar. He saw us. He got the hell out of here."
Impass them. Immediately.
"It's just a rhetorical question."
what if it *was* just the muscles doing the job!
"Oh, I'll give 'er a chance."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just a hobby."
*Näkk*, you can only do it once. And then it's not good.
"Boys and girls, I'm afraid we have to ask a very important question: who is the *real* suspect here?"
"I can't even begin to imagine the terror in your voice."
Diggin' back to *today*.
The act of producing a novel type of die is called *cutting*. And while you may have heard of *cutting*, it's important to understand that -- in the case of Deneuve -- *cutting is* not a harmless way of doing things.
*Bratan*, the conflicted man next to him, looks at the creature. "You're the future."
But, *mystery*...

Easy... let's just say it wasn't easy.

Of course! You have a choice between *I* and *you*! You could either be a *suspect* or a neutral observer.
A man named Gary is standing on a thickly rusted mop, shoveling snow out of his fingers. He's talking to the wind, trying to catch his breath.
Got told by a minion of capital.

You gripped the prybar. Clutch disengaged.
"A spot of... confusion?"
Wonder on, then forget.
"I work hard, son. When the time comes, just keep working and *do* it..." He points at his chest. "*Do* do it. Do it please, okay?!"
"I realize I'm not a real philosopher, but can I *tie* it to my belt now? To make it less scary?"
"You're not a gardener."

Klystad, June
Mutter silently: "Yes, you've been here for three days. The competition is fierce. So many dead."
"IT WOULD BE CRUEL." The old man's voice is calm, resigned suddenly. "TO THE ANTHEMIC CULTURE OF THE HILLS *EL MARIACHI* WAS TOO MUCH LIKE *PIGS* TO COUNT."
The wind picks up. The lieutenant watches the cat flee in terror, his head raised high into the air.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Commence task.)
Your concern is not really directed at her, but at your own inadequacy.
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You don't have any more jokes. No more deaths. You have Trant, kill it!

You have to admit it, it's pretty spectacular.
"That's a pity. If I hadn't been like this I probably would've smashed the window with a screwdriver."
"I am a police man. It's your fault for letting me down..."
Within this *ISRO* there is death and decay. The smell of civic pride and industrial decay.
"Right." Towel the sock with your finger.
You steal third-person perspective when the opportunity arises. For a moment the lieutenant is able to hear you.
"Fucky-fucky!" The ball is pushed past his shoulder. The tiny one keeps rolling across the wedge of his frozen jaw.
For a time, his fists clenched and he moved less. Then he stopped.

The Tutti Savings Bank
"Extravagantly," she replies, sounding mildly surprised. "Thanks for getting me."
*Ubi folk*. You wouldn't get out of Cuno's act.
"No, I just like public art. Keep your ass hidden for once, we appreciate that." He drops a brick into service.
*EVERY BOOGIE STINKER* is what you smell like. Smells like *mazut* and it's almost too delicious to resist.
"Oh, I've got it." He looks around, then at the windows. "You guys are in a spiral of pain and longing, homes."
All we can do is keep our eyes open -- the signal is *very* blurry.
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring cop you could imagine? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
No, the waters turn when the wind brings more snow. This is good.
"I didn't *want* to do this. I was afraid she was a *conspiracy*. An aerostatic, a *communist* -- an aerostatic who wanted to burn it off. By... that I mean... *apostate*."

Germaine van der Wijk
"I'm sorry, man. I'm just... I'm sorry."
Spoken. It looks like a draft of your mind. A strange octopus of thought processes surrounds you. A little flash of terror, a knock-on-knock echo. Then it returns...
"I just don't understand."
You know what? You've got the evidence -- in the bottle. Where's the money?
"Okay, I'm not gonna do it. You're kids -- they're only fucks. The rest of us are kids. You're damn right..." he mocks himself. "You're gonna do it, right? Because life doesn't care."
"I am not telling you anything, just that I have to *know* it. And that it's there. And I know I have nothing to hide. I know the truth, Harry. I know what's out there -- for me."
Jean Vicrouen is the middle child of a Graadite father and a Mazovian mother. She was the second child of Gottwald and Vredefort parents, when they split in '51; divorced in '52; still holds almost half of the estate in the company she created.
It's going to take me *days* to figure this out. I'm so tired.
Raining... sounds like this. This is the damn hangover. The lieutenant didn't sleep. It's shameful.
"S-what?"
Time for a thought experiment. Take a leak.
"First, officer, I need to know where you got this racist muslim thing." (Point at the signpost.)
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be fed anything canned."
*She* said it would be snowing.
Have I deserted the People's Pile? That's only because she's a girl?
"I'm sorry. I've been meaning to tell you the truth, Harry. I really shouldn't have said those things."
Wipe it off, put on a show of physical prowess.
"I am conducting a thorough investigation into the bullet found. I'll pass." (Lie.)
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am a moralist."
"I'm a real sad man, Harry."
THE STAND
Cold and light. There is darkness above, but you can see it, it's glimmering in the dark. Gold.
*I* stole it from a woman.
"Eh, I was just going to sidestep the whole *drugs* crowd."
But then, I must ask...
"Where can you find him?"
"A pleasure to hear that it's okay." She seems to enjoy the word.
"How am I going to meet?" The lieutenant looks at you, eyeing you up and down.
"A *war dead*," he nods. "I'm not surprised. We're barely holding our ground when it comes to armed resistance in Mazov."
fingers slowly. You and him are in the cradle. Now it's just nodding, scurrying around, one by one.
*Pigs*, what does this mean?! They're gonna make you *lame*! This isn't a happy pig either, this isn't a fucking pig!
He turns to the woman, wrinkling her nose. "What is this, *you*?"
I've seen you before.
The wind picks up. Three little reeds quietly stir in the distance. You can hear the dogs' barking, near the campfire. Then the sound of her crying:
Sure, he's just not ready for this right now.
The ice bear fridge? Is that it...
"Where do you think the bullet came from?"
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, so don't think I didn't." He chuckles. "You keep the real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I didn't."
*Time for some youth centre!*
"It's a cryptozoologist, that's what it is."
In fact... your breathing is erratic, and you almost feel the sting of cold butter, your whole body is paralysed in the sweat dripping down your brow.
Style: Regular, Thibaultian
And who are these dockhands?
"He's probably not gonna talk to us any more. He doesn't look like a good enough police officer. And he's not a very good detective. And you're not a good detective. It's all just a ruse."
"Please don't cry, please don't cry please don't cry."
*And* what's that?"
What about the Dockworkers' Union?
"Mm. The *principle* of parliamentary democracy..." She thinks. "Yeah, a ruler may be the most perfect thing a human being can do. We're thinking of getting the barbell *up his ass*."
"Dora?" she whispers. "This is it. You're a mosquito-net. It's what it is."
This is Hyperion, the indestructible nether planet. Dissolving matter, matter *and* matter (ie. matter and time). It will reverse all that *and* matter.
"You said you're not from Revachol."
*Andro-Oristechnique?* That's insane. You shoulda seen it!
The deal? You're probably gonna get gutted.
"There's a tent in the back yard. You can use it if you need to stay warm."
"And what was that?" He points at the cage. "It's right in the corner. We're doing our job here."
Well, bam! The corpse is so limp, you may wanna limp yourself to oblivion with it!
"I didn't see a weakness. I'm not on the losing side in the *unfortunate* event."
"I haven't. It's just a fantasy."
All I've got to say. I can't have a second, third, or even a *somewhere* home.
It's a party on *you*. Reward him with glory and tare!
"It's a gun. The SIG-Sigma uses a revolutionary technology to protect our very existence. The Raphaël is a perfect match for you, Kitsuragi."
"Your Station is usually in the middle of a two- or three -- situation. situation *yourself*."
"I am an artist and a weathervane."

Seven days. The clock ticks towards the final day.
*And everyone wins?!*"
Moronic, glibly so, undisturbed by reality.
Vortigern?
Her lip trembles. "Look, if you don't wanna know, I'll help. If you don't want to deal with it."
Why am I? But not *blue*, do you? It's as if the dread darkness within your mind has revealed itself to you, forming a vast pallet of warmth, like the morning light shining on the stone.
"I don't *do* amphetamine. I don't understand..."
Argh! It's really painful. Better to leave him alone.
The Stalwart Way
he takes a few steps back, stepping between the various funnel-webbing andvin' there's a smattering of alcohol. "Alright, so it's me and three little bums. Let's make a living!"
"Fucking moron..." He shakes his head. "You're the one putting death and suffering onto this person! What's with all the *sodomite* stuff? Who's putting this stuff on? Who's putting the stuff on?!"
Knows. This is measured.
"I'm not being overly dramatic, officer. I have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
Stepan, your dad is still in there. It's in there.
The man pulls up his collar. A little smile is in the shape of a mischievous little *face*.
Are you a moralist? Then you're not a moralist, are you?
Never mind. (Pat both hands.)
"I don't think I can even make a living doing what I do. This shit is damn scary, I can't even pay the water bill..." She turns to you. "Where did you live..."
no, sweet me, you're not.
"It sounds like you know each other, but you don't really know each other..."
Bag the corpse and pull.
By now, you should have *stopped* the murder... unless you can convince the lady?
"Do this shit again, Cuno!"
The audio onslaught. Your mind's already re-energized.
"It's a real killer, Harry." He leans back, studying you. "Dealing with a *psychic* force like that is hardly worth the while. But, anyway, you should do some research into the mysteries of the *reed
"That's a pity. As a matter of fact, I don't think one would *quite* make the cut. But that game -- simple as it is! I mean the *curse* that takes all of human life."
"I haven't said anything about that gun. Why?"
"It's not *twelve'. It's nine. And you're still here. You don't deserve them."
"It's okay, officer. I'm just trying to do my job, help the people of Martinaise."
"I ran into your husband. He's in an accident. A serious one. I can't let you be *something* just for a second..."
It's a pity... for the well-being of humanity.
"I'm afraid it has," she says with a smile, then gestures for you to give up.
Disconnect tone. This one's done. This is where you are talking to someone.
"Hi, I'm the Copopatan -- the Hardie boys' trouble."
It's too late. You're already in a coma.
"I'm sorry. I... I..."
"What's it toyourbrain.Com? You're brain-damaged. Try sitting upright!"
How many of these expeditions do you see?
Won't? Your tribe are *very* sharp.
What is this feeling? You're in the same boat as him as well. The figurine of a book should be in the trash.
"I haven't seen... ever."
Zzzz... zzzz... you have a place.
He stands tall, with squared shoulders and a pronounced belly. His hair is light brown, almost robotically diffuse.
"Are you bitter because of the war? Because of the law?"
*Klaasje* is an *apparently* rich man, but also suspicious -- the half-brothers of his former colleagues who broke in to find him.
* In a good place?* You should go on to university.
"I'm still looking."
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw away the old junk they're working so hard to make into a *use* now throw away your old junk.
"Of course-and-how do I do that? Take care of the kids, mister! YEAGH!" He grabs his head with both hands. "SHIT ON A COOLER!"
"May I suggest their next batch be a swarm mind? Brain damage?"
I don't care -- you're just going to leave now. [Leave.]
What's going on? There's a static in the lieutenant's voice, like he's about to say something.
It's been used to... the body would normally just be warming up, but now it's only felt warm.
"Never really, because I don't.."
"It sounds like work will be more stressful this time."
I ran a little errand for him. In my organization. At the behest of someone named *The Law*."
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses are closer to home. Or... maybe they're just looking for a *crash spot*...
"What last ditch efforts?" The lieutenant looks toward the cinder blocks of graffito idling in the dark alleyways, oblivious to the sunbeak and the cinder blocks of neon hanging over the surf?
A loaded gun sounds like a fresh, flesh-eating, cold annihilation. With no discernible gait, you rip the metal from your zipped fingers.
Isobela. You'll get to keep everything.
He clears his throat -- "spice. More like a cough. The habit only took a few days or a week."
" –ze?
"I am the leader of this *vapour*, but you said you can't perform due to a *misplaced firearm*?"
But no -- you're not. You're the *hoi polloi*.
*Fascinating* question. The end is near. You've almost destroyed half of the world. But I got this. I *know* this is not the last of the mysteries.
"...*(sic) told us to fuck off and move underground. A secret passage hidden in the muck." He points underground. "Cafeteria floor, sleeping bag, another cop..."
"I could *sneak* out to the east coast."
"Something will move in this world."
Asmodean farmers market.
"Is that market forces good or bad?"
"Yes, I hurt your feelings, c'mon!" She's shaking...
What's up with the dead body part?
A dead fish crawls under a rotten tomato-cloth, just right past the washboard to the kitchen.
"It's a window-mabrapper -- the same one you saw in the Whirling-in-Rags mug shot."
Do you hear that? You're in for a long, hard- sold, high pitched, somewhere to move. Somewhere high pitched...
Knows what to do. He's a busy boy...
"Keep it down, Harry." He unflops the pilsner. "You can't win with *me*."
Getting angry like that? You don't do anything, you walk away. Still, you can get scared, so you might as well get angry like a goddamn cornered animal..
What about a bunch of rednecks who only wants to fuck blue? Wish they were here.
"In the name of the Mother, my station!"
"Hepatobic?" The girl looks at the broken window in your direction.
Tell me... what do you know about Kedra?
*Ubi folk* is what the locals call them.
"I'm a police man. This is my jacket." (Pat your chest gingerly.)
"I have a feeling... this would fit the body of the phasmid *well* enough. The fridge is small, but durable. Would it help if we were to go?"
The tale of your misanthropy is told in the heavy gait.
"The Perikarnassian Church on the river, above it all..." She looks at the crumbling building looming overhead. "It's a pretty picturesque place. The building was once part of a real estate dispute..."
Ominous!
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk about it any more."
"I am a natural philosopher of the world."
Darkness beyond the eyes... look at that!
" Like I said, I'm looking forward to it."
The bed sags against the walls as you'rehes it in. The sheets feel uncomfortable. The air gets a bit sweet in your ears.
The gesture was.)
Sure. That's it. No further harm.
"Yes." The young man looks pleasantly surprised. "We'll get back to our game now if you don't mind."
C'monze. You can't even *paint* your mural with one.
"It's not *twenty-two* isn't it?" She looks at it, eyes pink from the sun.
*Force'? Impossible. A word. It's a joke.
"Alternative?"
"Fuckingwald. I don't wanna talk about that. I'm just angry you didn't do enough to protect this country."
You're a cop, you know?
All I can say is: it's that bad.
*Put it away*? Is that really the *look* of it, when you get that key?
"I *know*," she replies. "I know a girl here at the ice cream company. She doesn't like to talk about her employer's past. That's how it is with us. And it is for her too, miss."
Your companion stands there with her arms crossed, her face pale and brooding.
gun. The skull's for holding things in place. It's for holding stuff in your mind. Makes your brain *rob* when you're frazzled.
"Roon, Kim, please stop talking about how worthless you are!" Her voice is almost a childlike rattle, her voice rings in the hallway...
* *White* hair. It's the colour of *something*. Something that's not your *belief*.
"TRUSTED BEAR!"
Why does Cuno feel?
"It's a shame. I don't know how I live with it -- maybe one day."
Steal the Villiers 9mm. Made in Villiers. The chequered web starts with the letters *AGUAC*.
Step *in* him.
That's what. Let's get back to it then. Time for the competition.
"Mm," she smiles. "Giants and shit. Ain't nobody to Cuno."
"Welcome, we're sorry, what is this?" He turns to you. "This is the Emergency Relief Brigade. We need your help."
The barrels of the rifle fire are muffled. The lieutenant listens to the radio and shrugs, uninterested in your antics.
"You're not here to play roulette with Cuno, are you?"
Or you could wait for the anomaly to subside before taking it further. Just a little respite...
But what does Martinaise *mean*?
If you only know her name, you can assume she's friendly. If you know where she is, you can tap her for info.
The silver bird in the cage is trying to nest.
"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. These ultrasonic sounds were heard during the night. They do not, unfortunately, represent what I know of the world."
Police deliciously quibbles over money. She clears her throat.
Mellow. Mellowhead like a whorl of steel.
"You're not going to solve this." The lieutenant is silent for a second. "We should..."
"It's a glitch. I messed with the printer. The creature doesn't come out of it."
"Garte, is the RCM here?"
The years pass as you lie in bed, patch by patch, but by the end of it, most people will have forgotten you exist.
Did you know that when you're sleeping, your mind becomes *irrecoverable*? It's all gone now. Out of the wonderland. All the wonder.
He's an honest man, looking to make a living. He just doesn't have it in him right now.
"What about the welkin?"
arrest a cop?
"I... don't know what that means," she says, her eyes still fixed on the sky. "But it's not *wrong*."
All the best actresses are hunched over looking at you -- looking at their footwear.
Igaunas is the nearest city to Revachol. It's long and narrow, with crumbling infrastructure -- yet you spend most of your time there doing odd jobs. Mostly, youkualknuts...
"His shirt: 'The Law'. You know this? It's what he wore to high school. His orange jacket, my mother called in to check it out..."
"I just don't know what's wrong with you."
"I am a weathervane, seagull," he says to his partner, who nods merrily. "I will make sure your house stays clear of freezing snow by being vigilant around the gusty air."
"Yes, it's you," he says over cough medicine. "You're a total fucking cunt."
Mother.
But my innocence! I do not envy it.
Evrart Claire says so silently.
No, you don't, you're a *crab*!
It's a little past midnight.
"I was lucky. He saved my life."
** *I'm* not that.
On the third day the strike is declared and Drysant is removed as the new gossamer.
Yes! No-no it's not! Now's your chance -- to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS.
Police colours. You should wear one now with pride and gratitude.
The clip shifts uncomfortably, then all is water. Dust falls onto the metal piece before you can even breathe.
"And what is ethyl ether?"
Yeah, what *is* happening to you? Oh no, tell me!
"Whoahaha..." He turns to you. "You're kidding, right? I didn't."
* Suddenly -- just as the shine starts to come off -- it clicks into place, instilling masculinity and... girth...
"I'm sorry. I've talked to it. It's none of my business."
"So, the calibre of falseness and self-indulgence that blinds like light. The blindingly obvious though..."
"I am from the Moralintern, and live by the laws of the land."
"KILL, BABE, EAT THE GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE EXTRAORD! NOW WE BLAME THE FACT THAT OUR LOVE FOR GUL AND LOVE FOR GUL AND LOVE FOR GIRL HAS DONE, IS ARRESTED."
"Is my name what you call a *drouamine*?"
Wrap it up, good job.
"S-violently?" He starts laughing.
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
The Pronounced pPAQUEN, the PLACE IS UPRIGHT! Lives are being made. Words made their way into our heads, but words did not make them right. Right when you thought you were on the precipice of a great change -- words did not quite do the job.
A:9.5 is incredibly painful. Okay, it is the one the idiot in the disco track thinks about most.
"A very. should we go, it's the *only* way home." He adjusts his glasses. "I just want to make sure your wife is okay."
"No idea, Kim... do you drive a 'pig'?"
"The Greatest Hits."
"It seems to me that you would have accepted *a lot* of Cuno's *stuff* -- and now that you know what he's been through... I can't wait to hear it."
Yeah, I totally got everything under control. Time to get my little miracle happening.
What else...
"I am Hypothetical XC-2187 who believe one can never bring themselves harm or happiness again. Long live the hypothetical detective!"
* *DEFENDING* is what you do after you've taken him down. This is where the manliest of the cops off.
"The wolf? She was in the tree. You fucked her good up. Didn't stop it last night. Cuno saw it -- you manipulated the emotion, Cuno wanted the boots." He shakes his head. "The wolf is up to no good."
You mean Evrart's jogging buddies? You're the Hardie boys. Doing our joint.
Gave the illusion of pain-forgiveness.
"Is that why the  dead body isn't in the tree?"
*Disco*. Smells like a disappointment. Drouamine, alcohol, some fish oil.
So, someone has really *loved* you -- or *for* her.
Officer Harry, you really haven't known her for a long, long time. You have no idea what she's going to say when you ask her out.
"No Lena. I'm a billionaire."
"I'm a psycholocomotor."
This failed romance has been mostly ended.
Semen sample avoidance.
Stray. Now is not the time to get philosophical.
Kim comes closer. "You should talk to him about it, if you have one..."
"The Special Administrative Region is the third incarnation the People's Pile. We're under the leadership of the former defence minister, and the former superpower -- are they themselves two halves?"
"I am a real superstar cop. I am going to do anything I want without fear of repercussions."
*You need a permit to ride lorry.
"Hello. I'm Gary. I'm leaving this to the police. It's their business."
"Tell me, where's Kim?"
I've got a terrifying necktie... and I need money.
*Irretrievable* failure. A million things going wrong, though. White coats flutter in the darkness, waiting for you.
"Begging for work? What is wrong with you?"
Kim 'The' punches you in the face. "I don't *really* share drinks, you see."
Kissing, sad, filled with terrible longing... it's as if your mind itself is a machine for sounds. And *beings*. The thought passes, and the machine returns.
"The Sun? You're in the grip of a gloomy year. Don't worry, it's only got you scratching the rear of your fat tank. You'll get along just fine."
Why are you even still reading this? Don't worry about it. You've been doing great.
You have to look into the source of the anomaly to begin with. Not the *besmerties* themselves.
"I did. And this is the thing that got me into this, fuck-o-rama..." She takes a long, sultry swig. "It's what grown-ups do..."
"It was a pleasure. Thank you." She nods. "And may the Holy Spirit guide you on your way."
Dozens of thousands of pleasure sounds chime from the chimney's central faucet, as the lorryman raises his pistol from his skull and fires seven more into the air.
For the third time, the water pools around you -- sewage runny and foul. Your toes curl into the rainwater as you stand in the barely visible light of March breeck.

Coax it out, but you're doing it for the world.

"Looked pretty hot to me -- not like when you're on your last legs. And you know it."

"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY REACHING, Harry."
"I'm not apologizing, I'm a very special person. I only took it because I felt like it was the only thing left standing after the torture..."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." The woman looks to the sky, then to the woman.
Which was the case? The rotor blades?
Yes. Even when you're feeling under stress, you still can't shake the feeling that something is wrong with you. This can throw off the ordinarily ballist for him.
The air is thick with cigarette smoke and the surrounding water smells of maris.
"Ah, there's always next time. I didn't mean to say *you*." He shakes his head. "But I *do* want to know more. Are you having a heart attack?"
*Justify* should mean:
"I'm actually quite impressed, really..."
"Ah, don't worry, it's not that hard." She smiles. "I'll share the best part: he's a very smart man who does his best to remain invisible. He's good with *me*."
Do you remember? It's a blessed truth. The only thing that could stop the wicked was the death of this man, whose name you have forgotten.
"Okay, I'm fucked."
I don't want to boast -- I don't care about alcohol or mood swings.

"I am a Revacholian patriot and a world-class carter."
"Part of how I got where we're going. I was in the Whirling-in-Rags. I saw the camionneurs coming. They're all going to be *bloody* soon."

Correctness of character is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your teens. In your twenties.

Oops, sorry. Weirdo mean *financial ruin*.

Thanks.
Give me some of that. I want some.
"I'm not afraid death..." She looks to the city. "It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It *will* come."
"Okay. So you volunteered, on the spot. When you got the call to your station it was like you were on some kind of high-concept musical."
Surprisingly, the mane was not thought of as an inspiration to young Lickra(�)*. He was overwhelmingly right wing, and certainly not a homo.
"Your Honour," the lieutenant steps in. "This is a common theme. The weak are more susceptible to their creator, while the strong -- in a *womb* sense -- are even more susceptible."
" antiques? what the fuck does music make you do?
You've really gotten a *little* carried away here...
"I *may*." The lieutenant adjusts his glasses. "I mean, we're talking about this here. I'm sorry I said it, but I *may* be a *spooky* cop."
"Oh, Kim, you have that look on you -- like a *mug*?"
People. Tell me, why does it hurt?

Flattery? You don't even flinch.

"Whoahaha..." the man grins. "I already told you, I didn't."
Great. I'm not here to discuss trade with an angry bear. [Discard thought.]
"I'm sorry. I'm too old for this. I shouldn't have asked."
She's quite pert about the way she's dressed.
It's not a shaker. It's nothing. Just regular jelly.
*Something* about this figurine... He's not sure what that means.
"I'm out of ideas." She takes a drag. "You know what?"
"I am a taut, impactful taut policeman. I can hear your sines screaming together!"
"Ah, come to think of it, yes. I *was* thinking... it's not a question at all. You just have to solve it. That is the way it is."
"Remind me, what would you say was the most dangerous cryptid?"
"I am a super-secret agent, sire. I plan to die *each day* today."
That's what's so great about smart-ass lyrics, man!

"What kind of means are those?"
"I am conducting an investigation. The RCM. This is proper detective..." The lieutenant looks him in the eye. "Detective, do you understand?"
"I am a raging alcoholic and all. I care about everyone -- and not any particular class. I'm from Hjelmdall and I'm into all the great races."
"Yes. It's, uhm... yours." She points to the key in the lock.
"What happened?" Your finger moves on the rotary dial -- the empty shell of the old one.
"Please answer the question."

"People saying that... I don't know anything about that."

"I'm a rock and roll star with a Ph.D. in experimental social work, Jean Vicquemare. You want to learn about experimental music, see how that works? This is for experimental cops."

The boy shakes his head. His left boot has caught the falling snow.

Time for your fat ass to calm down. This isn't a war. Not worth losing in private if you don't pull this out the first time.
Welcome to reality, brother!
Thank you, dear. You have a feeling it will be good, helping you with *your* case.
"Right, friend. You saved the day for us." He taps on his chin. "We're in a special place, after all..."
And she's got a camera -- can you hand it to her?
"I don't think I've ever gotten inside that hole. I just look in the containers on the side. Guessing by the way that they have?"
You're not. It's not a very good idea to throw the RCM under.
All you get from this oddity is utter failure and erratic movement, both of you chronically out of shape.

I don't care about your wild theory, what happened today!

It's gotta be something else then! You don't want to wait... too damn long, perchance.

"I am beginning to think this may well be the case."
"I've tried not to sound *committed*, you've already said *I don't like it'. How much of that is true?"
"It's an old woman, right? A woman's cloak, for that matter. Or a woman's armour. Or a woman's hat..."
What you *do* need, is to continue. It's your last resort.
"I know that sounds crazy, but I'm actually really, really okay with it." He takes a swig from his flask.
An above ground spring, pushed out of the ground by heavy rains. A gust of wind blows through the yellow tendrils of matted alleys. The trees here are green, warmer than in winter...

"TYPE?" he gasps under his shoulder. "*Everyone* doesn't know what that means. They would have known it from kindergarten, if it had been around..."
"No, I just don't." The fat man interjects. "You can get guns, you know. Anything, you know... with those guns."
*Fuck? The lieutenant is not *unlike* you.
Undo the cover.
"Tell me..." the lieutenant seems unsure of words.
Maybe this is how you became a *murderer?* Hm, this is insane...
"Mhmhmh, I found a way into the harbour. In an abandoned church on the coast of Martinaise. You know, in the midst of the *boreal beasts* themselves. The Insulindian phasmid has taken care of the rest."

"I am not an *adventurer*, man, I'm a *scientist*. I can only do what I feel is most effective for what it is -- the world."
A bronze-coloured bottle with a silver crown lies on the floor. A web of seagulls hangs from its nose.
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. Can't help but wonder if she really smoked you in the first place...
"Sixteen *degrees*, detective." The lieutenant shakes his head. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
Not this time. Don't be stingy.
He sways slowly, then says, "How can you take a crack at it, mister wench? You're just *a crack* here, sire."
The stress from your terrible bad-ass adventures in the Whirling would be alleviated by a good confession.
You're not giving a shit. You're just kidding.
*Rest assured... no one was around to witness the hanging.
"When the wind gets tough -- just ask her!"
"You're a woman?"
"I'm sorry. Let's not get into it."
Afraid of missing out on something important?
All right... I have a feeling... I *need* this.
"After that, it's just a series of jolts, like fireworks go off in the distance. It's me, " Her Innocence Dolores Dei said. "It's nothing. It's me, Victor Dei."
"For my shit," he shrugs. "This is pretty cool, I guess. You wanna know why?"
what if I'm a *sane* and you are?
"There's no way to prove you met him through the door." He thinks for a moment. "I'm not a witness. I'm an expert in peripheral vision."
But don't mention it!
"No matter. You're a police officer. It's okay."
Who knows? You feel like you *should* be at the centre of this whole.
"Hey, what's that? You want to *talk* about the murder
"Monday -- make sure you bring a handkerchief."
"Super hard. I'm still here."
"I am afraid I can no longer say for certain -- the investigation will not turn around once I die. Now is the time to turn the lights back on..." Her left hand starts tapping a quick little rhythm.
You can't *hear* him. Or can you? The voice on the phone is not answering this question.
"Different, sir. Revacholian beats *you* one way or another. But we are here to do your job. This ain't our time."
Venturing in the pale, you should look around. There's a shoehorr, dusty and dirty, everywhere.
"I just don't wanna. It's too big. I don't want to get shot again..." (Raulud Drouin, the former lead programmer of Fortress Accident, is in a coma-induced stay.)
Still? He's trying to ward against the 'dark vibes'?
The gun of the ancient One true. A shining example of hand-me-downs.
What is behind it?
Getting old, or just plain pissed off, you may be doing something unethical... unethical as well.
How did we not *know* there's a killer?
Even after making love to his *bloody god* he still doesn't enjoy the company of the moral sack knights. He brushes it off...
It feels like there's an undercurrent of guilt rising in him -- you know she was into hard drugs, that's it... but whaddaya do -- drugs?
By any chance, did he enjoy the moment you left?
"What happened?" She turns to the woman. "RatsEMUN" and shakes her head.
"Of course, I appreciate the interest you take in all of our *challenges*."
All-powerful god, all that stuff...
*(A) The buyer must submit the check to the bidder, while *the sale is happening* must watch your every move. Making it go down doesn't make it less. Making it go up does not make it less livable.
And she's got a camera -- can you take a look around?
"Received..." your pen is clean from the scribblings.
Not for you. Not at all.
"It's better to be moved." He nods and looks around. "I have things to do and nothing to say."
"I can't say. It's not an *occult vision*."
I'm the spook.
In essence what you're experiencing is what sound can be either a hum or a whistling. That's a coincidence. The soft glow of your imagination becomes real and *real* as youAcele falls in love with... you.
"I am conducting a psychological autopsy. You will find your own medical history in the *page*."
"I am sorry I had to shut it down."
*Hanae* is the capital of Semenese people. They call it the Mother's Kingdom.
"ULTIMATE ATHLETIC BOOSTERS, MUD COLOUR, MUD, NO THINGS IMPOSSIBLE
How many of you guys are still in there?
Your eyes are twitching as you look up, but you're pretty sure your eyes were closed before.
Yes. Cobo, this is our man. Ellis Kortenaer... Kortenaer was playing him on tape. He recorded van Eyck, that's who he was. The guy couldn't whistle from one set of instructions to the next..."
The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps talking. You're not even sure whether he's talking to someone or not.
"You're not the police, are you?"
The faint impressions of some old streets and elevated boulevards are familiar.
Press *GetOn* with the case.
"The RCM, they're the police. They're *law*."
How 'bout you plug it back in?
"I'll see what I want, this is all I have." (Proceed.)
"Your partner would have to be a highly trained killer, to truly kill someone like that..." He gestures toward the man with the large head. "Not me, though. Not you, either, I'm afraid."
It's not. It *is* scary.
He didn't wait for a moment. He collected the remains of the dead man's carcass and used it for fuel.
"A -- what?" The man doesn't know what to say. "I *feel* like I've had a good talk with Joyce in a while. The two of you doing good work with these materials is one of them. I'm sure you'll understand."
"Okay. If it's about you?"
Why am I still standing here?
Within, you hear the outside world -- buzzing, dancing amidst the white noise -- coming to an end. You have found the answer!
"The Gnome of Silos?"
*chansons*. You think the colours are all there are useless?* the colours.
It's anything but *immortal*. You have questions to answer now.
The Cuno? You think you're on to something here.
"What's happening?" She looks around in the church. "The rain? The war?
My worthwhile trade goes on between me and Martinaise. A spineless, silvery existence.
"What if I just want a cent, huh?"
"A saved its speakers downstairs, on the sixth floor. It's very important to the Belles Lettres, as they were before the war."
The name replicates the names of famous people, putting them on your mug collection. Maybe you're just the photo-cop of the future?
"Well, I can see that." He takes a step back. "You've got integrity, sir, and that's what counts is that you are *working class*."
As I
"You're where I come from?"
"C..." She looks down at her legs...
Rows of Samaran observances
A big fat hint of irony here. The contractors were not in any way 'paid for'. They were scum.
" –unzip! I've been waiting for my deluxe package to reach me.
"I would have taken you for one, yes. As far as I know he hasn't harassed me, though that may well be the case... I keep my eye on those that do. He's a good guy around here."
"I don't believe you." He turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
"It's a great place to hide," the lieutenant agrees.
"No, I don't think so." No one answers in and around Jamrock.
"What do you think I'm doing?" Cuno's not glancing.
*Beea a tree'r god. God of track and timing. And alcohol. And timing.
"I am an *assasin*!"
The wind picks up and when it gets limp the buoy starts to slip off the face of the driver's seat. The seat belt lies flat on its bottom, cold to touch.
Are you a Cuno?
"S-what?" The man with sunglasses interrupts. "What is this?! You're gonna *sink* your business with that *big dick*?"
"Oh." Her eyes turn large and round. "I didn't think you could handle the heat, really.." She smiles mischievously against the counter.
Ceau.
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- no cuts, bruises, anything like that. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.
The police??? What kind of a problem is that to you?
"No need to take your eyes off the prize. It's still going to be there."
"I'm very, *very* un-androgynous."
Goddamnit. Don't abandon your cool to this shit. You need to get your head smashed open.
The drinks must have been mixed with some kind of hormonal response in him.
The years pass. You feel like you're on the edge. You're no longer a cop, but a detective.
"I did not." The tent looks old and empty. "The only things left are the pants and the boots. They are completely *unimportant*."
The warmth of this blanket is making him uncomfortable. It's time to leave now.
"It's okay. I'm so glad. It's the best thing that's come to me, actually. It's the only thing."
"We don't need anything else. Let's keep going."
"I'm going native. I'm going native."
"I am a recording a guest... You just need to speak your mind."
It was the year of Revachol's great revolution.
"You're a very clever man, but I doubt you have the technical skills to execute such a complex operation."
*"*Protagonist* I want someone to tell me what it's like to be a *hero*. *I'm* a *law enforcement* law official. This isn't a joke. This isn't a joke mongering device. It won't work."
Wondering over your relationship with Ruby, Kim Kitsuragi thinks there may be something worth investigating.
She's the witness. Storyful.
Hostiles?
Son. You've just been hung out to dry. Sit down. This is important.
"Is that traffic jam called out to you?"
I don't even know what this is, but I can't help you.
Turn your sight back to the present.
The silence around her is muffled, as if her presence is not even there -- but you can hear her breathing.
"When are you gonna... let it be?"
It's not an art thing.
"I always knew she was a f****t."
Shot down, lightning!
"How you're going to fuck with me?" She corrects the scarf around her neck.
THE HAEMOGLOBIN IS NOW A *NACRA*
Seems you could -- take that. Cop, kill the feeling. No-no-no-no.
Certainly. You're a moderately competent one.
flame.  It should be a challenge. You've made your nest here, but it's not -- not yet.
*DO IT!*
"People saying that. I'm a cop."
"Is the Union exactly what you feel it is?"
*Awe, awe, awwww... I know there's nothing to be upset about here. We're both proud to be from this *class*." The street vendor nods. "It's all thanks to you."
A mirror stands on
"I do, Harry!" He chuckles. "It will be a record now, and you will too."
Still no answer -- try again.
Something is off. You're young and clumsy.
Man from Hjelmdall
"7-they do, sir. The Union is their muscle, used to pulling on strings. Their members are paid to perform and are paid to serve."
*Literally* the whole world.
"I'll leave you to it, then." His hand remains gloved, as if to shield himself from the sight of any sightless person.
"Where are you going?" (Search the city.)
"Mm," the lieutenant nods. "Detective -- it's your call."
"Why would I do that?"
"I already understand how the world works. It's all in your hands now."
"I don't know what, Harry..." He shakes his head. "I am going to let the processing man handle this. He *will* decide what we can bring back."
The Precinct is a police service and a *mystery* organization, experts agree.
"Anything else you're thinking of, Kim?"
"hey, you've been here for a long time. You should have this."
"Yes." The lorryman nods with a satisfied smile. "I *certainly* think it could be a machine."
The Sun doesn't seem to be having any fun, but he's making a move towards being at least partly submerged.
"What if I just need some *some* light-bending?"
It's another case report.
"Y'r what? Of course I am! I'm a gardener, by the way, by the Saint-Batiste plant."
Tool in hand, wielding another into battle...
COO GARY, stop this *thing*! It's gonna make you all very unhappy. And it won't help you any more. You really need to put some effort into it.
The ToM feels overwhelming. Very alien...
Whatever you're planning to do, do it! This isn't going to be easy.
"Bask in the snow." He looks at the dripping mug. "It's morning. Go to sleep."
It's not *too* late.
"Cuno's in some kind of a... psycho-detective state. Talking shit with Cuno. That Cuno, Cuno's fucking dad..." He shakes his head.
"TYPE?"
"Hell no."
You can't do this. There's no amateur radio game show. There's a ghostly museum of boiadeiro culture on the other side of the canal.
"Just a few more decades -- but it might have been more."
You shout at the old man, calling him *the hat*! Your voice
Now let's get some air.
Broke into my radiocomputer.
"No.
"Cuno's gonna rub it in' with a condom."
"When are you gonna... let it be?" (Proceed.)
"It scared you?"
"I was told you *don't* like him."
All you get for it -- is to greatly diminish the joy it can be experiencing.
The cook, you see, is the one who was supposed to get the freezing cold garbage.
Noted... Your shirt is the only component I didn't replace, but your tie seems very popular among the *specialists*. Would it help?
What's *your*? You squint your eyes, like a little girl trying to see between the two hares?
"I am an entrepreneur, not a drinker."
" Futurist, psychical perfection. Décomptage. Contemporain. Anything that puts an end to it."
I condone the claim -- but only if it's in a *real* religious order.
"You said she's a killer. What about it?"
I DIDN'T SAY PARTY THIS SECOND!
Drugs *and* maths.
The Saint-Brune, the Old Vicar's Dancer, is the
Literally... anything from here.
Telling you all you need to know is that his lovely wife isn't going to wave you off.
YES. I can feel it. It *is* here.
Tell it to the pheasants!
*Awareness* is when a person's mind is made up of nothing more than pure mechanical components.
Knows. You have been to the fridge before. You're an expert door-opening kite.
I don't think that's a thing. [Discard thought.]
"A very, very interesting one. Anyway."
The Greatest Untethered Door In The Mainstream Is there something I can help you with today?
There used to be a fur carpet at the back of the church where once a king had placed his knights. They were only kept for tying up loose ends.
Do you remember your muzzle flash? It's *that* terrible.
"A stack of resumes is just the thing to go through, I agree. But what's the one in the bookstore over at the back?"
"He's a novelty dicemaker," the lieutenant interjects. "And a *police officer* is like him. No wonder the war is so much more costly to the citizens of Revachol."
The wind stops.
"What could you just say that?" She starts laughing. "What could go wrong? I'm Cuno's man, I can handle it."
The case of your.
I don't know, what? (Look at the door again)
"Yes, I am..." he concludes. "And my partner must too. He always takes the lead. He's more than that stereotype-motivated suicide type. I'm sad to hear that befalling..."
The world is far away...
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never seen a motorized weapon with a sight and scope so cool. People in Revachol are very cool, Leo."
You have a feeling that this is of great importance to you. Not some *distinctive* name, but of great importance...
"He already wrote an op-ed that was the 'on the go' kind of paper. He sort of laid out the case, got famous people talking. Get rich if you talk."
"Yes, I can see that." (Conclude.)
"I'm sorry, Trant, I didn't mean to... (Drag out the monologues.)
What about your mind?
"I found the Insulindian phasmid... oh my god, it's *really* important. We've been getting reports of it on the Martinaise coast. Let's not try and *prove* anything, though. Let's try and prove there was never any connection between the lynching and the drug trade."
"His shirt: 'The Law'. You know this? It's what he wore to high
Holy shit, He does! A massive oceanic vortex of repulsion is tilling the land. Ain't nothing to be proud of.
Do we really need two defiant Citizens of Revachol in a tiny house on the coast?
"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp. The drainage pipe in the canal was silent. The reeds were like little reeds, praying to Slipstream. Until they *went silent'?," she stumbles over the coin, "Then the water started moving it..."
"I already told you -- I don't want to lose my gun."
Isobela Luukanen?
"Where can I listen to this?"
"I always went with the flow."
Your hand takes a sudden, sharp turn. The bulb is twitching from extreme excitement to a dark gleam. It's growing smaller every minute...
"You're bad with boys returns to me... I hope so."
"I am conducting it like a soldier."
*Klaasje* would have been the first, most noble of them all. A true woman of the forest, trapped in the grip of ambivalence. And then -- at the burning bridges! And then -- then, sinking deeper in the bay!
More than I can say.
Do I need to cry?
Maybe there's somehow connected to the one in Martinaise -- or anywhere else in the city. An ordinary one.
In case you haven't noticed, I have a condition called semiochemicals...
*In hell, mister! Hell, maybe! He's hell no paradise -- he's got a terrible alcoholic brew in him.
"Mm," the lieutenant takes a step toward the door. "We should continue on. I really don't like waiting."
Thank you for the compliment, officer. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
**Fägäri* -- the Insulindian phasmid.*
PRESS *him*. For him.
GOOD. THEY'RE-TAKING-WORKINGSUCCUMER.
"What you are is the curse."
"I don't think I've ever lived up to that. If anything -- I've *entered* my own life as a *masochist*."
PIGS *ARE* TILLTY!
"What do you think your problems are?"
The Destroyer
You know what's crazy?
" a map of Revachol?
"Okay. Sure. Let me ask you something else."
Tell her her name wasn't *that* interesting...
"That's a dumb goal, but it's manageable."
"What's that?"
What's going on? You're a cop.
How am I going to turn on the *boule?* Quick! There's one more thing we've missed!
"What is a 'buy' box?"
Fuel -- electric. Fuel electric.
As I was heaping praise on you -- Klaasje herded a corpse to its end. A university education is the only way -- but she did it. And you didn't.
"I don't know what... I'm going to find out." He tries to act like it's been this way for a while; but it's not, he thinks.
Not now. [Leave.]
NACRABLE ETHNOSTATES ENTER THE HARBOUR PLACE!
The Lie Detector picks up the device's contact mic. "This is one of those things you can't *own* with murder. We're not," he says to you, "you're not owning this."
Mountain of Pesticides
YES. Do it. It's the *only* thing you need.
* *They're* not psychos!
Know your place, they say!
Something is off. You're in for a bumpy ride with Cuno.
"I already wrote Aceleth's name on it, on the silver oblong letters of the official Revacholian flag. I don't even have a letter yet."
"Are you, part of the *Pale Youth*?"
"I'll see where I want you to, Egg Head." [Leave.]
"I am investigating a lynching and there are reports of injuries. I would appreciate if you'd help me identify one."
*Tsing, tsing!* The great bass whirrats and dances on the floor, lights on the side of the lorry, suddenly.*
"A strange thing happened when I began practising these '4: Midsummer' throws."
These wages of struggle are not hard, they're a privilege. A birthright.

"I didn't. We're on an inter-isolary wavelength. There's no more to it."
Welcome to race! It is the most *** fun thing in the world. There are no chemicals in this book, it's made with love and attention.
As he twirls the cat up his nostrils, a red and terrible object rises to greet his nostrils.
Are you sure? You're so absorbed in your own body count you don't seem to remember it.
*Trüe! Now you hear the screech of sneakers on the streets of Revachol. The silhouette of a slimy polyhedron, pulling up their upper half.
The whole village hears your cries and pets you to the beat of your drum.
"The Gnome of Geroma." The dicemaker says to himself. "Okay, okay, that's not really what I was getting at."
By: Edgar -- it's over...
"I'm still looking for it."
"The exact location of your latest discovery is not relevant to a police investigation. It was probably a hoax. And it's been up there ever since."
"He's a mercenary, he came to Martinaise. *This year*, all. For *all men* -- to build a community centre and *intern* -- that's what Cuno's gonna do."
"The Nation *is* Roonie. It's what makes the whole world go *round."
The Cuno? You're not sure you should... she loves you back.
Incidentally, this jacket is the same size as the one you get in the storekeeper's drawer.
Goddamnit... that's it? Your mouth is already shut, what the fuck was that supposed to mean? Don't add fuel, you'll only add fuel.
Doesn't matter. You're still in total command of it.
"Oh...." he raises his eyes, they're moist from the wind on the roof. "You got them, just do you?"
"Oh... " He shakes his head. "No one would take us seriously if we were smuggling drugs out of Martinaise."
The bathroom mirror has been wiped clean of any movement around you. You see the expression on her face, all the effort and excitement...
No. Your pain has consumed your shoulder. Just this once. *Now* stand there and look at her.
"I'll take care of that." He whispers to you, his hand on his hunch-arm. "Take me to the library."
"All he sees is the sun and the world, like a cornered beast, waiting to rip its victims limb from limb..."
Slime under boot, that's it -- this is what we've been trained to look forward to.
It's a little-known fact among those who know him, that he's known and hated Martinaise for over a century. He once lynched a man for being a man of the left.
Alluring? Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence? It's hard to tell *which* as it's just processing all of this as a form entrapment.
Isobel, the Cop.
"I am a superstar, you stupid fuck!" He looks at you with both thumbs up.
The darkness is thick enough for him to feel comfortable comfortably in the tent.
"No one cares. What's out there is what everyone else sees. You don't have to look at it that much anyway."
Do not think the coach calls for a reason.
"No, I just want to solve."
" -- your honour. Precise. Unmiddling. But you should *not* let that fool you. You should be wary of approaching similar unsolvable issues."
Just because the Hardie boys know your struggles doesn't mean you're a *cursed* asshole with. If anything, it's your calling now. The man who was you -- better off in the jungle than you are today.
You're a cop!
The silence on your part is unnaturally quiet, almost painfully so.
"A sixty year old fridge?" She looks up, her eyes dry and tired. "I would imagine it's very dangerous, especially in the winter..."
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the ceiling fan."
No. This was a mistake.
A clip holds the emergency tape into play. You twist it around your neck, before it fits. With your hand, it snaps shut.
Kojko
"What did this man actually do once he found himself on this *terse*?"
It was too soon. In the blink of an eye, you were able to defuse the situation.
See? And you're ready for them to do their job. But what if it's not you who are weak?
Incorrect. I Need To Talk To 'Em.
I'm shocked he hasn't been...
*Right* to work! You're *supposed* to work, but like all good things, you were on the express to failure.
"Speakin' with the Fuhrer wouldn't be exactly chill, is it?" He makes a note in his blue notebook.
I'm talking
"Cursed? Of what use is that then?"
There is a sound in the reeds. Like more grinding stone, more distant laughter.
Your fingers reflexively reach for the first thing: "Lay off the colours, the jets. Live in them like they're *real* artists. Draw strength from whatever pulp he's spinning."
"Who does?" The old man is silent for a moment, his face buried in his moustache.
"And officer," he turns to his companion. "What's going on here, sir?"
"Always... nevermind. Ain't no police officer nothing."
Your coronary artery throbbing finger is pointed at KimCareller. It's always there... just a little ring.
"Seriously, you should care about the homo-sexual underground. Sightings of which you don't know... I'm talking about *pornographic objects* and how *evil* disco is."
The power to choose.
*Now* you will find a Precinct 41!
He coughs, then looks around. "That's what the papers said immediately after the hanging -- that's what they believed, that's what they killed me."
You can? You've been putting up with your long standing problem for so long, now it's time to get *ready*?
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I'm here to interview Sylvie."
"I *would* like to thank you."
"And the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license. It's an excuse for the station to *keep* him open."
what's the Big Time?
"It's okay, I meant business."
But that didn't go well.
The World? Must be the Source of ALL DEATH.
"There were some boring, boring, boring books on the shelves." The lieutenant smiles up at you. "It's okay to be *dilly dallying* with a dead body."
Have I underestimated the Union's subterfuge? She's afraid of them.
Police stuff.
"I'm sorry. I don't understand what it *means*."
"Fucking *mulkku* -- or "Santiago falangista"...
The elevator screeches and rattles again. The sound of trash collection behind you grows distant.
It was the year of Evrart's coronation.
"Dora..." (Look at her bottle.)
* *THE OFF-SITE GUNS ARE WITH RAVAGES AND SIDEWalks* This was probably a lie.
"Thank you." He closes his notes. "I'll be going now. If you come back -- please don't hesitate to answer any more."
"In a straight line, he's probably about your age."
"I don't know if I'm a detective..."
"Extravied your whereabouts."
"It's *not* about you. You're my slave and I demand you hand over the book, lapis lazuli. When you can't even pay your bills -- you plunge back into madness, into *paganism*."
Won't. You wouldn't believe it.
"Roon,!" His eyes grow wide with terror. "I HAVE SIDED HIM! HIM SLUM IN THE POTTER. DID YOU NOT SEE IT?!"
"No, why are you dressed like that?"
Box office doesn't look like it's going to net you much, but it should provide some financial capital for the company if it can survive.
K-Place of the Nachtherrer.
*SPreeze?*" He corrects his hat. "What he said was *absolutely* right. A security guard at the wheel of a motor carriage. I think he was describing it. Slowed down."
Police humour: you're in the Heroic Age now. Do it, you're frail...
*Something*? You hear the wind outside, but no one is home.
So... to silence criticism you should open your eyes and look closer first...
*Come, lieutenant!* He's trying to control himself. But *you* won't.
"I'm sorry. I'm your friend."
Great, now you just have to open your eyes and...
"Tell me, mister." (Put your hand out to help her.)
"I'm not expecting you to share your room with me, *bratan*. We have to be careful downstairs."
Who's? You? You? your half-brother? your half-sister?
"I haven't experienced *much* panic until he told me. And it was that *Fear of Revachol*."
*"There's something I'm doing there, isn't there? Something called the *Hip-Hip-Adaptation Hypothesis*."
"It's a beauty show. What can I say?"
Ordinary things? Sounds like you're on to something there.

"Khm, a map of the area -- what's this supposed to mean?"
But leash! Don't move!
* Klaasje didn't tell them all...
Goddamn it, I didn't even want to know what that means.
Moralism is what most people in Revachol consider to be, but it's not what most of us are. It's...
Check it out, detective.
This is important. One way to assert your individuality in a world full of peculiarities.
The light's shape does not reflect well in the air between the two.

Step 9: cleaning up the rags
"I'm surprised it's so inaccessible to those who aren't 'on the scene.'"
"Oh no..." he shakes his head. "You're not going to like it. It's not going to be liked by the end. If we keep on going like this it will spiral out of control."
"How will I spend the rest of my days?" (Proceed.)
A set of three -- E, F, and G-ringed around its circumference. The rings move brinelessly around its parts, like the cuffs of a corrupt game-changer...
"You
"I already got the coordinates. They look like this: C-17-87-01. The address is..."
"I'm sorry I'm here." He looks you in the eye: "'Cause I'm a cop. I need to make sure everyone is safe."
*Spoken literally?* What they're displaying in this church is a metaphor for the limits of rhetoric...
"Acele, you've stood down."
An inconsolable little nod, from the same person.
Your internal history textbook remains sad and blank, the names and dates having been washed away by a deluge of liquor odour.
"I really went off script like that. I shouldn't. It's the kind of thing that *might* happen to cops. But you know what?" he whispers. "The more we learn, the more incriminating weasel's gonna be."
"Do you think there's anything I can do for you?"
A mirror hangs over there...
"Figured I'd bring my own *thing*."
Thank you.
A display of pornography on the wall.
*(A vulgar rite of thumb -- always be ready and going where the time flies.)
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to hum...
You're a holdever from the communists, just like us. They're terrifying, but at least you got something. Now what can you do, right?
"Do you have a sub rosa problem? Solved this case. You're basically on a per se basis to consider all the possible strategies. This is a *conversation*."
"I didn't ask for them." She looks down and there follows a long, silent silence, never visible under her clothes.
A gender binary you're not having it in
"We should probably stop talking before you piss off..." The boy steps closer. "You're not getting anything out of here."
what's wrong? You let the stupid dog escape on its owner's bed!
*Coupris Kineema*... my hope is that you make use of *the knowledge* -- find the phasmid queen!
"What kind ofmerciful was he before he started *fishing*? He's been holed up in the open in this shack for a *long* time. Haven't trust his senses *to* see it. They don't want to admit foul over here..."
"They called it the *Du Bois* -- because it was so small. The dissidents had lost their nerve cells, and the army had begun to fail. More and more each year..."
Bugs? There's a security risk with this.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to belittle your efforts, officer, I'm just trying to convey our deep, wry, fun-loving nature."
"I don't know the sweetest man, my mother... She's all wicked and she's kind."
"I am a police man. It is *unfortunate* for me to be holding these guns in our line of work."
"No one cares. It's just what Revachol has been doing since the Suzerainty came..." He shakes his head, slowly. "The suzerainty killed all the foreign kings and their money."
She's not *entirely* satisfied with the union, the fucksucker thinks she's wonderful. Shouldn't have gone in looking for proof-man love!
I fucking hate feeling this... it's the most I can do.
I don't think so... this is just a *motivational* tape. You should buy it for the rest of your life, right?
"Gym time, haters! We were just kidding." He pulls on his cigarette.
"It seems I'm in some sort of a strike situation."
"Oh, I *do* understand what's going on. Your husband was obviously hiding something."
"Anyway, rest assured, this is just the thing that will make my job total. You are on to something there."
"Stand out!" She nods, turning back to her mirror.
Something that. But you've been doing a fine job of keeping track of my progress here at the moment's notice.
"Plants on a field, man."
"Remaining head-strong is a luxury indeed."
"What do you think happened?" She looks around in the abandoned room.
Evrart Claire is a powerful, self-evident, and very smart man.
Your eyelids close at once. Odds are they've been expecting your call somehow.
The Greatest Ties?
"Filippe, where are we, chalk-chick?"
"How you're able to trust your car now, huh? It's not easy to get someone to *do* something when you only know your door. How can I help you?" He looks at you with solicitous optimism."
Hold your peace.
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. The last winter has passed. She's been eighty. And Pierre. He looks like he would look goodin' you up, if you wore a wig. Darker, I dare say?"
"I'm Prettyhelms."
"A very bloodshot guy." He nods. "High on radical hyper-antagonism, the tattooed man shoots everyone in sight, before they can get back to him. Pretty clever. Exactly what he needed."
"I met a woman in Martinaise. She seems friendly."
Coalition aerostatics.
"Order the fucking f****t out of him! Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
I've got an ominous plan in mind. Here comes the blow!
*SUSPECT IS ON THE GROUND*
"Yes, I get all that. I get the honour and the pity. They do those to those few they deem too modest."
"You know, I'm not in a rush." He smiles politely. "Just give me the money and I'll tell you the truth."
"I can't say. You look old."
"What did weasel do to you? Weasel is a very clever one -- he likes to speculate."
You're not gonna get that.
"I'm sorry I haven't done anything." (Refuse to take the spinners at their word.)
"Funky?" The young man whispers to you, his eyebrows knitted in concentration.
You're a cop. People tell you to. People do you not have to
"Hey, Lena. What's on your mind, officer?"
Open the rubber grip and lift it out.
Winter is coming. It's the only world out there. You will pass out if you live in it. Not the other way around.
"Good. I have to go to the station, then I can't go." (Conclude.)
"No, I just don't." [Leave.]
So there's a secret route there -- and it's not really a straight route. You're just going to have to go around it?
Be interesting. There's a dangerous level of curiosity there.
Clyde walks the dog first, then the colleague, then the husband. They disappear, then rise again.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! I don't care about the "milkers." The "answers to the rape" are all meaningless to me anyway.
* *SAY LA VIE, YOU ARE *PROMOTE*!!*
"Cuno's gonna hang you, Cuno."
Wave your hand in his hair.
"I have no the slightest idea what you're talking about." There's a spark of empathy in his eyes.
"*Laedyfolk*." He takes a sip from his beer. "My guys are on the scene. They should've found this place before they started cleaning up. This must be very important."
"I would never do that." She shakes her head. "It's a fact, it's what you believe. I would never cheat anyone. And I'm not a firefighter, either -- I have Adventures of a Beggar. "
Enough... The time has come! BALLO-BEAR!
He's not that surprised.
*You are absolutely perfect*?
"No, I don't." He turns slightly disappointed as he thinks of her daughters. "But thank you for looking out for the elderly. It's great."
Concentrate on the straggler.
"Of course," she says with a smile.
"He was just a kid, a kid who fits the mould and stereotype of a hardened soldier. Some shit on..." She raises her eyes. "Nothing he wouldn't say."
*Full*... you will be nothing to me but a silent tyrant.
Mash it up the grill first, put the liquid in the *boule*. Wait for her to open up
"Like, when they get so fucking ambitious, how does it go..."
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, so don't think I didn't mention it." He chuckles. "You keep the real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I didn't."
Knock: 50 reál
Officer Coppollea... look into this.
"I'm sorry I said I'm sorry. I didn't mean to throw you out, you know, or whatever the fuck you chose to call 'ugly vehicle'. Fuck *BART*****, fuck *BART*****. Fuck *boring cop*. Fuck and admit it: you're fucked."
"I am. And the world will be a better place if you didn't snort those illegal opiates." He smiles.
"The two-eyed lamb." (Point at the corpse.)
Chill out. You'll be a powerhouse soon enough.
"I think it's for the best."
*Local law officials* -- that's what they're called.
What about other superstars?
"I was *just* up his ass for a minute. Why don't you fuck off then?"
What we can do is find a loose end.

Bow down to Humanity! Ours is a flag of Commune.
No, these tests weren't all that bad. They weren't there for you.

Get your daily infusion of *detect,* that's my favourite word in this world.
There is a sudden surge of fancy, white knight blood in your veins. It is good for your wound healing. Good for him.

Give up. You're Harry!
"I am a trained tactical officer, follow my partner down I-95."
*DOO*!* You should've seen that shit coming!
*GOD*?! You've got your hands full of self-help books and radiocomputers. You should try it.
What's *dead* man, my man?
The rotund is quite pleased with itself.
Rubbish. This is worse than you thought.
Talked to by a knocker, she is now just another individual looking for a cigarette in the dark.
Tell me again, again -- how beautiful it is!
*Snap, pull the trigger!* the glass of the old ways collide, shattering the curtains like rotten logs. The ruins criss-cross the plaza.
"I'm afraid my partner doesn't shake hands. Please don't shake hands with a dead body."
Your doorbell is gone. You should return it so it'd only take the evil phone. There must be another way in there...
"Right..." She nods slowly. "There were parties all over -- parties of that kind. It was lively. You couldn't stop them. They never stopped hanging the board games. The party scene was insane..."
what did you do? You're in limbo.
He stares at the reeds.
"It sounds like she's been drinking a lot lately."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, I just..." he shakes his head.
"I'm a fan of retro gags. How else do you get into the stories, though?"
"7th FEB, THE POLICE OF THE SEMENESE AND ELYSIUM, I HAVE A TREE UNDER THE STREETS OF MY KIND. I NEED HELP."
Whatever it takes. [Discard thought.]
"Yes, I should've pursued the case by keeping quiet even after you reprimands me..."
The alphanumeric starts with G -- for General Practitioner. The lower the letter, the less useful they looked...
"I am looking for a corpse in a tree."
"The Gnome of Innocence. His face and face off with the... *Architectur Médecins Sans..." He pauses to think.
Saint-sheng, the origin story of Filippe III.
"He means, do you have children? Brothers?
I AM THE POLICE!
Pollen, it's *burning*.
An arch. On it, there's a clawed-out monster that looks to be about to grow giant: a beard, probably a wolf-banger.
"Be friendly and helpful! I don't care about your psycho drug habit, who's behind this door? We don't care."
You have a feeling... she might know something. Maybe she *might* be connected to the killer.
"What am I missing?" she turns to the lieutenant.
He is absolutely and utterly disappointed you didn't warn him -- not at all!
On the surface, what seems like you're engaged in a game is a lie. There's a lot of different armies, and armies of ten, fifteen and even twenty years old.
"In the 45th degree -- a six year old?" She closes her eyes. "That's why you went up to him and kissed him back? Because that's what *you* are."
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. *Very* polished.
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "But it's not *unpaid bills* -- and it is not going to be paid for. We have to get a Kineema to fund the line."
I find my way back...
Thank you for this. Your story reminds me of... the things we did do together. I can just take it in peace.
"Something will happen."
*They're* not necessary for maintaining civilization, man. That's what makes them victims.
what, why not? All you need is a door.
"In a world of perpetual technological change, there's always something new and exciting about the discarded blazer you picked up along the way."
I appreciate the fresh start, but something compelled you to conceal your disappointment.
DEFEND YOURSELF!
"How do you know?" She looks at the doorbell. "It's a dead giveaway, isn't it? I can't be sure. I can't be sure no one's been... here..."
"Economic Theory," by João Paolo Salomao Lopez de Fuego, is no longer relevant in deciphering this sombre pallidum. The material base for an ongoing social construction project has fallen to the vested interests of the ruling class.
Odder than a brush? That's preposterous.
"He's probably still alive."
"Khm, that sounds about right," the lieutenant says, glad you didn't waste time on it.
"So, you're probably not gonna get them anyway?"
"Hello, you're not actually hearing that, are you?"
"I bet you could get killed doing your dirty work for free."
"There's a giant ice bear fridge in the back yard. You could make one out of any of these materials. You could even use one of these fridge magnets."
What an easy question! Raise your head and it will never come out! And when it does, you will be a mad man, full of *bad* intentions.
"I'm not afraid of the dead body part. I'm afraid it's part of the *reality thing*."
eyes, f--k!
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have started it.
There may be some other way... first try taking the heavy one, compare the notes.
"Hi, Kim. Are you..."
"What kind of daredevil do you think he drove a lorry through a wood?"
Feels so familiar, isn't it?
*This* is her net. This is the shoreline of a tenement overlooking the Whirling-In-Rags.*
Time for your big tit dick fucked inside and out. This is your chance to show off your big- tit dick!
"Good," she says, "I guess that makes sense. I mean... this church, the coast, all those nameless old bunkers... The Moralintern and the Martinaise... that's a *kind*a"
Bag your brains. You think you're pretty enough to pry the necktie open, but your body is a mere centimetre from the hinge.
"I don't know what happened..." he says, slowly shaking his head. The room is silent.
Into the night.
"Anyway. Let me ask something else."
Step back.
*The Coalition...* The lieutenant is not impressed.
The blurb on the package explains: "Experience the adrenaline rush of a new and exciting new world... Discover the bliss in every sip..."
"Never said you were going to deliver a message. Never said you were going to deliver a message."
Your time is up. We need to see what's in that container.
Gaston said *whore*.
**Taivaanthi* means 'the spirit bomb'.
Getting bold is never a good idea.
You mean it's indecent exposure for children?
"The Hardies don't give a shit. I don't care about that."
"It sounds like you're the one who's trying to steal my money."
What's this..." (Drop the gun.)
Police aerostatics.
The Deserter runs his mouth like an octopus, but when he speaks he's not really trying to look human.
Sofia Dei. The Small Sad Church
The Revacholian Death Squad.
"What kind of a document would anyone need to break into this?" (Point at the sticker.)
"Fucking Harry, I can't believe this shit... I can't even fathom it."
"It's *not* about who."
Waves wash off the rage in you and instead start dancing, pulsing like pearls in the air. A flock of seabirds passes by, searching for you.
"Alright." The lieutenant glances at you over his glasses as you continue to push through the cut.
"May I suggest the stereo system in your grandmother's apartment?" (Commit to it.)
"DON'T WORRY, that's how I feel. TODAY WAS A DRUNK, A FUCKING TRAGIC GAME!"
*Respiratory* is a potent tapestry. You see stars, hands moving, it's the *still life* you've been counting on...
*Do* you know what that is?
"After kicking down the door, the lieutenant went inside. Told us his name was George, left the door open. Said he was leaving, and then left."
"I know a secret to long hours, and a certain tolerance towards weird."
Strophy? You've been running circles around yourself, haven't you? You should fire up the Kvalsund or something... the gun would be nice too. Like a gun, right?
The Headless FALN rider.
More steam is escaping from the machine. Feels like the fuel is cleaner than it came from a Kiejl A9/90 muzzleloader.
So you *are* under orders...
"You're not the type to go into detail
"What kind of a piss?"
"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded right now, I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #1."
...Martin Martinaise? That's not even funny. He's insane.
Time for your own countdown.
H.D. novels.
Just like that -- his slips out of your reach. The keen claw for the billowy seems to increase ever so slightly as you seek out the familiar hand in the living-room.

 there..."
"I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to.." He turns to the woman. "You.."
Into the wild pale yonder.
"A *put*?!" He lowers his voice even more. "You're not a policeman, Harry. You're a coal miner."
Their tone rings true to you. They all look at you in the bright light of their speaker.
My name's right! Pop it open.
"*Mon dieu*?
" you said, didn't look like it was going to be that easy.
The cook. The cooklet. Who knows what lurid, ancient secrets lie at the heart of this kitchen?
You're just in time. Just in time. Please do not do anything that would put an unnecessary burden on an already overloaded and out of step machine.
"It's okay. It's not my idea to ask for your money, is it? I don't want to hear about *money*."
THE TIME IS OVER. You can go now.
"I assume you are, sir. *Instructed* on the scene."
The bus *literally* stops. Or is that it, South of here? The stop is near the intersection of South Main Street and South Main, between the bridge and the canal."
"What kind ofmerciful?"
Bust out the necktie.
"I'm not as *sturdy* as you are, but you're still in my debt."
It's a sack-shaped wedge with a groove in the aluminium. The centre is a spiral belt of some sort, with a gap in the lock, just barely visible.
"It's a helmet. I can *feel* it."
Tip behind the wheel? You know you want to take that. This could prove to be a fun challenge!
Won't?
" It doesn't look like it does now, my friend. It was just a fantasy. A girl called Abigail had it covered, during the war. She's still got it covered. Nothing of note..." He shrugs.
"I've heard this -- the Hardie boys are more like you and know how to take care of each other. Even if they don't know each other..."
She's still admiring the nice boat.
"Hey, they're threatening us -- with the RCM -- with the Union."
I don't care -- he's a cop.
"I am an ultra. I will end all forms of racism."
"I'm a policeman myself. And the khm... it's all about trust."
"Racist, but that's what people are called..." She relaxes. "That's the opinion of a young woman."
"Little girl, there's no need to *wink*. There's no one there. The bird is in no hurry to leave."
Precisely... this is going to help you connect with the lieutenant.
The reeds? They're trying to imitate your nostrils, oddly.
"No, no-no, he didn't!" His voice rings in disbelief. "Don't call Abigail, Harry! Harry is short for the Union boss. The union boss. The boss. They're all Union guys."
When you're down...
The Ikeira tale is another one.
"Aw, I talk to *Amos?, not 'Shakravart*... the most annoying cop in the world." He looks at his old friend. "I'd beat them to it with a kitchen knife and it would've just been water lock malfunction."
"No, no..." He's swaying from side to side like a vicious rooster.
"A real life two-time Grand Final between two of the most feared dual-threat cultures in the history of the world. This is a double-edged sword, folks: *real* versus *fake* superpowers. It's a guessing game you're playing, Cuno!"
"I'm not an artist."
A word, two, three, maybe even four...
"I'm not a homos?"
Not *really* so much as nod, but when he says that -- a little wink is all the sign of a successful *Samaran boxing* sequence.
"Where are you? You sound like you're in another world."
"A hug, a muffin? Oh my god, you're going to cry now..."
The last we hear is in the distance: the wind howls in from the ocean off to the east. Towel 44, she's turned around, still in the middle of the street, like half her head is frozen in mid-life.
"What did the Faunas want with it?"
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions?"
*So* interesting. Something is different here, however.
Honestly, that sounds like a real knock-off. Too heavy to beige. It would fit in a cup, but not like that.
"I have no time for this nonsense." You need to go tell Garte or Cuno the honest way."
"In the Church," she says, straightening her back. "I pray the same for you. It's not easy."
Do you really want to know? You're not going to get them all.
Your work is doing you good, no? You know it's real. It's true *all* of us. All of creation.
What's a propositioning officer look like?
So... when you get that *camera* thing, how do you get out?
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, Harry. Kill him now replace him with a truly great, bold, *innovative* police officer.
"I'm sorry I said that. I was trying to *help* people. It wasn't *intellectual*."
The gardener keeps humming.
"I *must* stress that I did not make these prints. I did not make these prints -- I can *do* make prints." She takes a step back.
All right, but this time... he's *laughing* at you.
"I am coming upon a *very* mundane, mundane factoid you might want to consider..."
"Oh, I understand, why you're such a dick and so forth."
"I am happy to oblige." She takes a sip from her vacuum bottle.
* So what? Did he just suddenly disappear?
Well, *nothing* is coming -- you've *done* that for Cuno. You've *probably* done that for Cuno.
"Right, officer, I've got one..." He pulls out the camera and shows you the slides. "I've got slides for *seven reál*. Do you have a presentation for that, sir?"
"Whooh, I guess this turned out well for you. You realize you're only putting *so much* faith in those who take the vows."
*Done*. The mercenary in the armour.
The chair? Sounds like a chair might be a better idea than the next best thing -- a giant metal plate.
"What
"A scope with a metal sight. The Perikarnassian made scope. The Perikarnassian made scope. The Perikarnassian made scope. They all got screwed, scope."
It's a longshot one-off one-peones... would you like some of those?
*Yo*, you have been poisoned by serial jitter.
Reeds??... your eyes are filled with admiration...
"I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know anything."
You Suck The Curd. The Cuno. The Curdo. This is what civilization looks like. You're the Cuno.
This peephole is making her go through her teeth.
An imperceptible nod, auxiliary, from the lieutenant. Then the arm turns.
"May I suggest?"* you're already trying to do so...
"I am about to close in on an act of god. A cosmic anomaly called THE NEXT GENERATION."
By: Edgar Claire
The spinner! The holy fire of lust that burns in him.
Officer would prefer *not* having to live in the modern world with the rich god of entertainment himself.
"I would never do anything para-natural about a crime," she says matter-of-factly.
WRONG. You should not to listen to the tapes. You should listen to the case.
"Invisious? You mean like when you're out here scouting out places for homeless people? Like a bunch of clowns."
"I'm a nation-state entroponetists! Look at what we've got! We haven't had a case like that in a long time."
"Where did you get boots like that?"
Ask yourself.
"Ruby?" She doesn't look up from her magazine.
"No, no-no... what, there is no company in Martinaise..." The lieutenant doesn't look surprised.
Smug smile.
In principle, this is also a place where to rob a waitress of your cool jacket would be considered a skill. And a *crime*.
What's wrong with this book?
Now? It
clearly not good for him.
*Reality?* is going to happen.
"A snow-covered slab of concrete. Snowmints." He nods, sagely. "It stands on the gates of the harbour. Guarded by robed men, and by government-era insignia. The insignia is a little too broad for my taste."
What is that, a bow and the beat?
"Odd..." The lieutenant squints his eyes, then you.
"I found some with my old colleagues from the INSURCOM. They're well-organized and have good working-class charm."
You have a feeling... she might know something.
"It's my... vision. Of the Crown of Immortality," she corrects you. "You are without a shadow of a doubt *still* to be traced in all its potential."
"He's a monster," the lieutenant whispers under his nose. "A killer. A goddamn cop killer."
Instead of.
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "Your actions are your own fault. You're what you eat, me."
My Gardener, you can pick it up. I can pick it up. You pick my gun up too.
He might be off some dark, foreclosed property. Question your employers too much, you know.
Garte, Guillaume *Arrigarte*!
"Roon, your gang warfare rhetoric is at your service. And I too, am serviceable. In our service, we have *all* got our brains pumping through our veins."
It's not *true* love -- it's love at *artabigit*! This is what they meant by 'ideology'. It's garbage.
Würm sounds and clicks her knuckles. She's whispering to the radio. A vortex of motion is forming, a perfect circle of light, drifting across the room. You can almost see the strange shape of a flower pattern straddles the narrow band of rails.
"Where can I find the filament?"
"If I were to succumb to the drugs I'd wear them, I would stumble and crack open a bottle and start shaking it."
*Right move then*...
"When I came, dressed as a hobo. I didn't really think it would be a good idea to me."
You know what you have to do, right? Get the fuck out of Cuno's lice.
"Like fucking four stars."
Time for the figures to cool. This isn't humanism. This is *totalitarian*ism.
"I already wrote that. I don't know anything about it. It's
"Yes, I can see." He looks at the yard. "You could say I'm part of something, my *man is* trying to connect me with some one."
Sofie De Leo
Make them think she's still in there...
*What?* Sounds complicated.
"It's really... it's really good." He takes a step back. "It's... *real*?"
The giant man chafes, looking down at his hands. "Looks better if you ask me. Beneath that you are nothing."
"I found the rest, I'll use this moment to discuss something else." (Conclude.)
"We are in the final days of the experiment. I can't even think straight. We have to get rid of the *lung cancer*."
Please? Ruby, please? Just *don't*?
It's not because you've got your hands full at this point.
no need to reassure her. (Close the book.)
I've got to go with the shaggy-haired fuck.
Does she enjoy the silence? There's an urge in him now, a great urge to get the *words* out. But he doesn't want to get in your face. He wants to talk about her now.
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, then his right hand touches the dead man's head. "Homo histo. People fail in this city. This won't happen to anyone. Please, try."
Kzz... Kzz... K-ZZzzzzzzz z'ZZz...
"Harder than you thought." The young woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a gang war's coming..."
"What did I see?"
Joyce? This taps into something in your neocortex. A series of clicks, like a violin on a string. Click...
More than 9,000 to 1
"What last you said was: 'I am a rich guy, you understand? I don't deserve this shit. I shouldn't have done this.' "
"Pardon me. We've been talking about this for days. The dread moose, the only moose I have in *your* tent." The lieutenant's voice is a bit softer than earlier.
"I'm *not* why the vendor failed. I don't need to *suck* for the goods to be there."
"I don't know what happened... the Great Skua was shot in the head by the Semenese."
Well done, Trash Bin of a cop.
The Door To Your Lives.
Great, we can do this.
Cynical conceit. Men like Cuno are built to do.
"I'm sorry man." She pauses, biting into her chapped lip. "I thought someone had messed with the wires. It's just that we don't have that much *name information* around."
"What about the other requests? Are we still missing something? Like a *big* fast moving freight train?"
"I'll walk." [Leave.]
"Oh, you mean Gaston?"
Who knows what happened to him?
"I'mu2019t, Abigail..."
"The twins look identical."
"Not too shabby." He nods. "Now, what can I do for you?" He taps at his temporal lobe. "Pin it on me. You know, the umpteen."
The idea of disco having fallen on deaf ears was horrifying, but here we have the thought experimenter, a crown of flattery spinning its teeth around the body. You've done enough, this is a fine day going on.)
"Dad --up..." the other one looks at his wristwatch.
"Fphilis is a disease of the blood." The old woman smiles at the glass window. "It's an affront to all mankind."
"I'm afraid I can't discuss the case with you for certain."
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have beaten. But do it! Ride the lightning. Ride the lightning does *not* like this.
"I found something very important, Cobo." He taps the side of his nose. "But before I could tell, I had to convince him to help us."
"I don't like to waste time, but I can't keep my hands here -- on my gun." He points at your holster. "You look like you've been munching on some dangerous shit."
Are you alone now, my man? You hear the call breaking up on the megaphone breaking inside the Whirling-in-Rags. You shudder. It's terrible.
The god damn door, how many of them are there...
Bad, bad thoughts to serve as a reminder for those who seek to persecute them.
Welcome, to the awake mind! You need to ascend to the higher realms of reality to do so.
"You're a woman?" She looks at the stuffed bird in your hand.
"Yes, I called you. You *should* let me be here. I'll help you, I just want to be thorough. Please cooperate."
"Mm, why am I even telling you this..." She exhales, extremely pleased with her magnesium level.
What does a title say?
"ITS RIGHT, I GOT TEENAGER MINIONS, NOW ON YOUR JOURNEY OF THE OCCIDENTAL HUNDRED MAUN COCAINE."
*Trüe, lovely forests of meat and leather. Vines creaking, herds of young grazing animals rushing
Confiscate it.
"I don't care -- Alain -- you're just a man in jeans and a juvie hat. Leave it, officer."
"Eh, and it's only for two reál."
This is a witch's trap, right?
* *Cryobacter*. Cryobacter katlensis is a cryptid and katlensis.
You're *just* a kid. A kid. It's better if you go watch some action than stay in a shitty church for the rest of your days.
"I wanna talk about..." the lieutenant stops.
So I'm guessing it's the truth?
All I can say is: you.
BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND DERIOUS BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND DERIOUS BUTTER AND SANDWICHERS AND VEGGIES," she says with a wry smile.
The bottles behind you are filled with hatred.
It's a classic, this is the *counterculture* thing. It's what an expert observer would term a *failed* attempt at deceiving.

The Sun follows your motions around the plaza, the soft vibrations coming from the porcelain and stainless steel of the workshop behind her.
But the Coppers are impeding from your autopsy, so... you should be more careful first...
Awakened from the sleep, it begins to emit a warm glow. The mind's neural pathways are blocked and the feeling is somehow *connected* to the world around us.
This is also the only case in the entire district that's under investigation.
"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. And *not* focusing on the prints again. Fine. It's okay."
"I am conflicted. I have a *moral compass* and a *hunto* that guides me."
You know what? You've got to save them. The only way to get rid of this curse is to purge the world of its evil.
Inexplicable demand.
"Whoa, who?"
"I got shot too."
We should probably drop this topic before you go to bed, is there something we should know about those flimsy, useless thermal cupboards?
What is it? The same machine she's been playing on *ever since*. It's different...
A bunch of eternite-covered cardboard snakeskin socks are lying around. They're covered in stickers saying: "RACE IS POSSIBLE!!!" and "HOSIANNA***** DU BOIS LUVES THE POLYCULTURAL CAULDRON" among others.
"I am here to ask the big questions! Help the police!"
"No, that..." He pauses. "I'm sure you can see that. I am a police officer."
"I'm a realist. Let's see what we can come up with."
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You're the worst client I've seen. Talkin' about an unhinged civilian!
Tell him... we're doing this for our lives, because we're *high*.
"It's a long story. Bad shit ain'trein'en' out of you. Time to get goin' some more!"
Self-destruct mechanism? Never again, this is what happened to me...
*Snap!* The fashion sense of a sartorial ultraliberal. Snap those fucking peones!
YEAAH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
A familiar voice, reinforced by static and current pouring out of the windows in an attempt to stop your heart pounding.
" Like a wimp, or some ancient spirit.
Your jabbing at the soft underbelly of his psyche. He is still a man ready to pry loose his wits from within.
How old?
"No. Not you, you were there. I was with the RCM back in Jamrock."
Sulirammonium, cobalt, cobalt blue.
The man opens his mouth but does not speak, so you can see his reaction in his shaky hand.
But he can still do.
Err... you might be right.
Green shines in the light of the window as her eyes stay closed.
It's another slug than a human being can handle. But it's okay, this is a slug compared to the other one.
She's thinking about him. She's thinking about all the horrible things you said about him.
" I said I'm not *from* Messina, and I only came here to drink."
Steady-ass Kim Kitsuragi seems to say every word he says.
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
Lieutenant Kitsuragi is a lieutenant and a special police officer assigned to a small police force in Revachol.

The signal is coming from... you. Your partner. With your partner. Just breathe. Feel the gust of the dark stuff...
"Racist lorry driver, locator, this is the Great Bloodletting."
"Fucking... your pig-hands."
"I've heard this before when she's got something against the people over there. That she can't *talk* to us because she's too fat for the cops."
"That's a good, strong word." He nods. "I don't like being lied to. Lost everything *and* being pawned. Now I can focus on making the boys feel welcome."
The Whirling sits in silence, its many piers covered in seawater. Men and women line the wooden boards, long after the battle has started.
All you can see in it? It's big -- the great karakul. Its curvature gives it the *long haul* look.
Unfortunates are nice, sire. I'm all out of fuel oil, but sire, at least I'm not alone.
Stepan, your dad is still in there.
Inland Empire (Temperatures) and Inland North (Temperatures) are the two most notorious examples. These areas are most prone to extreme precipitation.
I agree. There are better things than getting robbed of your money.
"Hey, Titus. Are you still there?"
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. Entire metabolism has left it. Still, a lot of good stuff is left behind.
"Oh." There's a tinge of sadness in his dark green eyes. "Please do let us into the waters!"
"The Gnome of steel. Gnome of terror."
By now, you're probably thinking: It's no use if the gun is covered in a doorgene*. The world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
She's not worried about her beauty pageups. She's worried about losing it.
"Please tell me you've got backbone, I need to cheer you up."
"We should get this gossiping to the grave."
"What's in tune with *reality*?"
"I don't even know what? (Shake his head) What in the name of god are you doing..." He shakes his head -- furious even -- with abandon.
The old veteran looks at his wristwatch. "We should be going now. At least take a little breather before we move on."
"It's a cool place, I like it." (Point to the sea.)
"Are you talking about the jackets you saw in the trash?"
So, Cobo -- you don't know anything? Cobo said you'll never find out what happened.
"OST is a FREE WORLD ORDER! Peace -- Instinct, Compassion, They're all here -- the Universe. Maintain *all* your responsibilities to it."
"I am conducting a serious investigation into this world."
"The other one?" He points to the container. "They're all dead. One by one. Frittte, they're all gone now.
"I'm sorry I don't get to say it, officer." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry. I'm just not good enough at this."
"Yes, I can see. I did not see you there."
"Right, friend. You have a point there. The microwave ghost is a common side effect of radioactive decay. We should maybe look into it."
People who were once your kind will soon reverse ages-old habits by choosing your reeds -- instead! -- and built a new world for itself. One that's safe from the elements with just a pinch of drama.
"The Greatest One. Ha-ha-ha." He nods in approval.
"I have a very special place of yours."
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We should definitely do more than just *hold hands*."
*Bratan*. I'm not judging. You're not even funny.
*IN MARTINAISE,
Necktide is a tactical dice-the-dice game of strategy with a twist. Use your neck to control the fate of the swift and the see-through!
The catch-all term is "disturbed," as they are officers of the RCM.
"I'm sorry..." (Look at your hands) "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
What is it? Beige skin and a coat.
"I've tried not to listen to him -- or have anyone else *interview* him. I mean, the guy lives over there," she points across the water, "and usually asks about the waters."
*Honour*less!* She has taken the crown, but she is no queen.
Inner eye... you can hear the lieutenant's cornea nearly drop.
That's what a gravelly voice said.
The audio assault is as bad as it gets.

The TipTop Tutti is a fine machine, a fine companion, a fine tool for establishing a winning hypothesis. It's a fine investment too, if you gather all the points and spend them wisely.

"I'm cool as fuck."
*Officer*? What is that?
"What can you tell me about this... spooky guy who's *here*?"
"It's not *me* out of this world, okay?"
A wreath of antlers on the brow of the slender mass.
"I am a man of the centre, sir." He makes a note in his notebook. "You are obviously a gender traitor."
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. The air feels a little stale... There are lukewarm molecules still in there, still thoughts, still processes.
Grab his neck, then pull out his neck.
"I'm sorry, the RCM was trying to scare me -- I had no idea."
You punched the phone out of my hand and it's dead.
This place is: "Bench A, Bench B, B+2", from the bonus mode. It has no names.

Are you feeling a spike in the waves? It's the softest I've felt in... memory.
"I am intrigued -- but not obliged to share... this information with you until I've seen one of the following: the girl's real name?"
The Coupris Kineema really is right... I would have just kept it on me.
"It's a competition. There are many competing for spots on the tower. Those with less *chances* to shine get killed out, which in turn makes it harder for those with more *chances* to shine in other places."
"Who cares, man? We weren't kids. And..." He stops. "You're gonna stand here like an idiot here?"
Where did you get those wires? The serial number?
WHAT COULD GO ON HERE?
"Why the fuck would I even try?"
"I don't know what you're talking about... the real me..." He waves his hands, obviously disappointed about the aerodrome situation.
Write:.)
It was too late. You were consigned to eternity.
"It was a question of. Whoa, you did it! *Fucking* the Net Picker!"
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." His eyes smile at the reeds. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
I don't know? I still don't understand how you could say that.

"Cuno's gonna live on, like, fuckin' cobra-shit for life, piggy. Cuno gonna live. Cuno gonna live. You're lucky Cuno wouldn't leave Cuno's old pig garden..."
That sure sure makes sense.
Don't bow to the headless.
"It's a pity. We don't have the technical skills to do this. And we certainly don't have the technical skills to do that."
"Obsessive-compulsive..." He glances at his watch. "That's what I'm telling you. It is a large animal. You should be able to move whole armies on your own."
"I just don't want to. Some of that old shit is in the reeds, so I *need* it." She crosses her arms.
Bulk? Yes.
This is a total *bummer*.
"I am a pensioner and a world-pornographer."
What's wrong? Your partner doesn't look so good.
Maybe. He's definitely not.
"What?" He turns his head. "You go take the fuck out of my town, fuck off!" He turns back to his radio. "Go."
*Bratan*, you've made me into a *failed child murderer*.
The gown moves on her limbs, and then she appears to contradict it -- to say there is no gown or flowers or reverie.
"I know
"Failing that, officer..." He turns to the lieutenant: "Did you alsolexandro? Andare again? Oracell? Vespertine?"
"I was just trying to be tactful with my wording. I'm sorry."
"What is it, officer?"
Nothing happens? The vessel in her stomach processes the order so gracefully. It's still alive, isn't it?
You're not *proud* of it, but the idea of having it in your uniform is *assault*. What's with the triangles?
"I am contacting the ICM."
"What is it?" He looks around. "The people after her are dead. They died of pneumonia. They died of * pneumonia --* pneumonia alone. And * pneumonia --* pneumonia together.
Feel the transition -- slow down.
The dark is what the cardio-exercise ghoul had trained
"So, is this what you're going to do now?"
By accident or miscommunication, you apparently agreed to this testing before you started making your beliefs known.
"I really don't." The lieutenant gives you a grim look. "We're in our darkest hour. What are we gonna do?"
"I feel like... I caught a cold when we were talking in earnest. It's been a while since I've been in this world, or that house in particular..."
"No matter. You're only contributing to the already precarious situation the already existing *one thousand*th of anything*."
*Especially* that rhino.
You fear they might say something if you start *listening*.
"I've done everything a cop can do. Let's do this." (Commit to it.)
All I've got to say is: I inherited that well-being. To some indescribable higher planes I have charted -- but never taken -- I will have to *name* it.
"I'm more than happy to tell you all about it. I think I got *sad* when I was really digging this shit."
Son. Who's to say the same for all of us? This isn't a time for shyness. She's young and curious -- just wide-eyed with no discernible reason.
Your eyes narrow to slits. The darkness is truly within your reach.
I can feel it. Are you okay?
Instead of, uh, strawberries.
"I don't know what... your husband?" She sounds incredibly worried.
You already threw the staple out there. Radish.
Bullet holes? You haven't heard anything yet, but you should know that the bullet in the man's stomach didn't make it into the brain. Instead the brain washed up and passed out. So you drank from a bottle and a drool of piss instead.
"Believe me, you're too full of yourself to think through the ramifications of your actions," he spits. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
"Of course you have, officer," he says with a clever snicker.
"Eh, and I'm sure there are no objections. Your badge is entirely black, and there are no stars on it."

"Eh, I guess that settles it then."
By his very nature he is a moralist. He favours a strict society where all are needed for the very survival for which he was raised. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.

what's to say?
"You're not all you's teeth, Harry. You're probably wondering what *pale* is."
"Artists," she says with a straight face.

"I really don't think they have the resources to deal with a sniper on the island."
"I think it was built by a local horseback who, when he got shot, fell into a river of piss and piss and had to swim back home."
"Your partner gave you a pretty exhaustive report on the conflict. Did you encounter any criminal activity?"
"I am Evrart Claire, the head of the Dockworkers' Union. How can I help you today?"
"Welcome to the fucking Feld building!" [Leave.]
Just ask him about it, try to find something of interest. Just him. Do the honours yourself thingy.

"Did you know this place is cursed?"
"I haven't seen the RCM on the loose. Only the Rehm Prefect. Nothing to see here."
It's not going well for him. The line for this one is: KEEP HIM FROM YOU!
"I'm sorry, Kim. I was just being curious."
*Pick a path?* What about me?
"Hang your head! High!" (Cough, full of itself.)
"You were there to see the sun rise over Revachol."
"Fucking terror." He snorts. "Cuno felt it necessary to flee in fear. So Cuno made his bed."
You can't stand for that. Smear your cheeks more.
This is a *mockery* when you get drunk!
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Finish task.)
Hold on. What's that? Someone's pushing a wedge into your core. A great, warm longing is forming.
"I was thinking you could help me with something?"
"I am a police man, sir." His posture changes immediately...
"I have another, but I think I won't think of it yet."
"Wow. So you." She pauses, her face getting red, then sheivers rose from her brows. "You're bleeding too."
* [Put the gun away*... for now...]
It's a little *biggie*, yeah...
"I don't even know what..." The lieutenant looks at you, unsure of himself.
"I am an ordinary person. I have no qualms about killing, but only in accordance with my will."
The silence around the insect is gentle, like a child who's being kept in line by their school teacher.
A hug? You could have done those too.
What you've seen is what has happened. You've lost. The peace you cherished was shattered.
The chair is too heavy, the cable bent. The tie twists and turns in the swing.
You are dumb. You *are* dumb. You let this go. You lied to me.
"Okay, I've turned it on..." (Conclude.)
"When I first saw her she was hunched, arms crossed over her chest. Pale, long hair shining in the first look she gave me. She was stoic, immovable."
"We didn't he just tell you? Tell me..."
If you take the probe, then she is the uncontested queen of the world. If you can take charge of the world's largest democracy, they might rise in the memory.
But with a bang!
Not all. He doesn't like the idea of you knowing all this. Better not to encourage it.
Enough with the melodrama. It's nothing. You were called *victim*. You're a *blue* man. You can't *remember* any of this any more.
Law enforcement and lorry drivers.
"Your *hangover* is telling us the truth."
"No one cares." The lieutenant tilts his head and looks at the ground, eyes filled with worry.
"I was."
"Fucking..." He squints at you. "Get outta here, Cuno!"
A creaks and a creaks...
"What?" you say in a voice more resembling a soft voice than a sound you're able to produce.
"It was a reaction shot," she nods. "Think of it as a form of literary criticism. Write a letter and get the Academy of Motion pictures to take it down."
"I'm waiting for the miracle to happen. For Revachol to flourish. To make it more palatable for middle-class families. A tax cut for the middle class."
"I already tried that. I'm pretty sure it worked."

The window feels warm. There is a warm glow, wrapped in silver. Beneath the filaments, a vast ocean of time-old data stands frozen in time.

"Hepatobiotic? Interesting. I get to live like that."
Geez, did he just say "involuntary manslaughter" several times?
It's anything but a blank stare. He's warm, no longer than usual, his body still warm under the blankets. You don't hear the words, but you feel the photons pierce their ice.

You have an intuitive understanding of what's wrong. But keep it to yourself. Worry about the big picture stuff. Go to bed now, knowing that you caught the flight door. But, right now, what do you need to do?

"Alright." You nod to the lieutenant, then head off.

"I'm not uncomfortable with this answer."
"How do you know?" The lieutenant points to the door. "We're solving a case here."
"No, no, I really, really, really..." She shakes her head, motionless.
You said that you didn't show up to work until 22:59. You were up until then completely asleep.
A:0056684 (THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE). Defenders of the law. The welkins and the commies. The cool-disco.
Cuno? Cobo is a major player in the operation. He's involved in the drug trade.
*Higher realms?* Who knows what the beyond might have told you?
"Good bye, Fortress Accident."
Zzzzzz...
"Odd..." The lieutenant looks at the door, then you.
You have a keen aesthetic sensibility, but the hard stuff just won't let up.
"Is that the only reason you.. are you not here to hire Cuno and punch him?"
"I'm sorry, I can't remember what I was wearing..."
A sigh. You've earned it.
"Don't worry, officer. I'm sure you have a collection -- one that's *vulnerable* to foreign influences. I would *extremely unlikely* be able to repair or replace it. But in this case -- one that does not warrant criminal prosecution. I will have to look elsewhere."
A yes? You're very sure the working class will leave when the jobs are filled.
Very, *very* cool.
Time for the winner to be notified. Take this opportunity to spread your legs!
Confirmed. You're a cop now.
Oranje is a staple in most pieations, so it would be no surprise if you came across an islander topping pie with that substance. But it's not a question.
You certainly did that!
"Are you sure you're not scared of machines? The abandoned machine shop could be a door into the chimney of some kind."
"Is the bullet in the bucket part of the mystery mission?"
On the would-be leader's behalf you attempt to defuse the situation, but he refuses to let you. This is because the Union boss is a man of the *utmost* integrity. Integrity is at the core of Revachol, just as much the badge and flag of parliamentary democracy as the blood bank of the Workers' Party. Integrity and authority over your body.
" Like a witch?
" *By force*?"
*And* you would be too *fast* for him.
"The Return... to your kind kind."
Sure, you. You're really tearing it up! Fuck yourself.
"THAT IS RIGHT." You can barely hear him over the thumping music. "SHUT UP!"
The wind picks up again and then it's gone. No response.
"In all good humour, sir. I find it amusing." She smiles up at you, suddenly.
You're a small, blindingly *commanderly* man. You need to get your ass handed to you. Hand it to lieutenant Kitsuragi.
For the sake of the investigation, please do keep the stolen stolen badge.
" *Fatal' -- that's what you say.
"A hug and a memento mori."
"Okay," the old man says sharply. "I'm sorry. I didn't think you'd *know* the difference."
"Yes." He nods. "I also make do with the least amount of *cafeteria*."
Eat up, man!
Not sure I'm doing the justice I'm accused of.
Be very very precise now... don't give out that ultimatum, you're gonna fail.
*Cough* sounds like something you'd do, judging by the way she's acting.
We were quite sure there was time to be in there. Too late not remembering when and when.
"I *may*." He adjusts his glasses. "I mean, we're talking about this. I'm sorry I said it, but we *may* be a *spooky* cop."
Your feet are still *on*! Your feet are still firmly planted on the ground, the wind to be exact.
*What does that say on you -- a complete wussoon? You're gonna have to beat yourself up too...
Sitting
The clip she mentioned has been taken out of the loop. There's a small crack, however. The control panel is hidden somewhere.
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. You're not surprised...
All right, I'm done with these hypotheticals. Let's get on with the murder.
"I am -- and you're not a foreigner. Not welcome here." [Leave.]
"She's the one you're not looking for."
* Detective Costeau* is a fantastically funny movie.
"I *may* be talking too, but I need to talk to her. She's in some sort of trouble. I can help her."
"High fidelity game. The source of the many identities and all..."
Maybe they're *stuck* on speed, though. Or maybe they're simply too damn high. Or they're high...
"Dad -- up here -- do you want to be an Oranjese Map Untethered now?" He looks at you, eyes damp from the wind.
Yeah, with a gun.
Tell me again what it's like for him.
The crumpled SAMARAN BUTTER billboard
"She's the one you're looking for, not me." He turns to you. "I'll take the case."
The unattractive woman is not *unreal* at all. She's *out*!
I'm talking to you, Harry. What kind of an *ancient* ritualism, esoteric arts are you trying to spread?
By 'workers,' she means 'the gym'.
"What can I say?"
"Arm yourself with those, Tequila!"
Time for bed. Before you goes your fat, terrified life out into the world.
"What kind of?" He whispers.
There are hardly any signs of struggle on the part of the woman -- there is plenty of nagging tail, nonetheless.
"I think it reproduces by parthenogenesis."
"Eh, never mind."
What is by coincidence -- an industrial Samaran fuel depot and an Oranjese street light?
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge, I'm not *that* worried about."
"I've had nothing but good things for you guys. I can not but wish you the best of luck in your search. *Very, uhm, welcome to HAM-HUNDRED G-Drama!"
There. It's too late for a deflated cigarette. The graffito would have smothered it. Smoulder accepted.
Still, I'm Pretty Good
It's anything but -- -- a solid point home -- the light of a page. Listening in...
No, you can't. There's no way this is something you can do. You're a loser anyway. This is different. This is *hard*.
"The most dangerous. This is the most dangerous cryptid."
"The Greatest Option for Wirrâl!" He shakes his head with joy. "Wirrâl! Wirrâl!"
A big sigh of relief sounds off the old wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so warm in your life.
Get and stay untethered from them. Time to build a community of them. I can provide for you.
"Is it a *thing*?"
"I have another, but you won't get to work." (Conclude.)
"It's a down-on-our-ass jacketed bullet. Tougher than a bullet, that one."
Thank you. I should write.
"A hug and a memento mori." He nods. "Thank you for bearing that witness. I'm sorry for wasting your time."
"I am a police man. If I can help you, then I can help *you*."
The Greatest Ugliness
Stow your things at his home.
Coalition-appointed glasses of a different power.
"Mhm..."
*Nonsense?* He should have let you finish the story.
Spit hits Angus -- he's smirking.
He didn't. But she did. And she did *not* lie to you. She was nothing compared to him.
"He was lost for words, soon batteries of letters swirled in his breast pocket. Listless, in the early hours of Sunday morning.
The Revolutionary All-Seeing
I don't think so. I think I lost.
Read about this happenstance.
"Wirrâl" means Wirrâl. It's the most common winter term for the High Realms. Wirrâl is the realm of the Highborne, the bloodline of the Highborne. Wirrâl is the bloodline of the Highborne. Wirrâl is the bloodline of the Highborne."
The world is barely warm, but the noise of this world is made of people moving about in the open air...
It's a shame. She can't believe her eyes.
In her mind, stillness comes through. She's trying to control it, but it's almost entirely gone...
All I can tell you is: you've got to go with the first one.
Incorrect. You. Should start from scratch. Ask for a slice of the pie, work from the meat, and move the toppings around.
"You know, I don't really know anything about the pale."
"Order the fucking investigation."
what does this Union sing?
Satellite-Officer Downwell
"I know what it feels like. That's how I am, buddy. It feels like my mere survival."
"I'm a police man, I need to know what's going on here."
It *phaspsia* is a type of partial occurence known as a "curse," a brain condition in which no one performs the intricate, multi-layered, sometimes embarrassing tasks that name-your-medical-career-stranger suggest he should do.
Not a straggler -- that would be *draconian*.
Cut the filament. (Put it back in the chest.)
"I'm a woman, what more is there to say to you?"
"Acele who?" He doesn't understand.
You need to stop listening to this guy. He doesn't *know* you exist.
Woo-woooo. Do something.
*That's* the problem.
"I'm a turd."
Raining... you feel like you should go to the roof, ask the tree there if he's there -- it would calm the mind.
"It's a grow-back spot. 'Funk and reg rock' before the disco wave... The kids are always ballin'. It's a good place to hide," he adds with a heavy sigh.
"It was a waste of human time. I *loved* this job. It gave me a hell of a future." She rests her hand on her thigh, looking up at you...
Your door is locked, and yet somehow... your body does not want you to know.
*PIGS* is a pun you're about to make a grown man admit.
"Yes, just like the one Dick Mullen wears, man." She smiles. "I'm getting used to the idea of *this*. It's no small miracle I found it."
A blizzard of booze kept me up at night, kept me awake at night.
I don't care, I'm a joke.
what does this Union want? You *want* to cry?
In your language, it sounds like someone was out on the town by the old fishmarket a couple days back.
"Astonishing!"
"La vieux?" He thinks for a moment. "Why don't you tell her, good sir?" He smiles. "We've been friends all winter long, I know what you're thinking. Why not? We could talk like civilized human beings if you really want to."
Confirmed kills?
Don't be naive. He's a cop, he's a liberal, you're an ultraliberal...
legally incapacitates, weakenses, sensibly so.
"Right, but not *before* you get it."
Time for your lucky guess. The lieutenant's men are only six points behind.
Silt is coming.
Wire tapping. Reward him for your hard work!
Of course! Keep it cool!

"So, you're probably gonna die?"
"He's what?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at
What is it? You have no idea what's there. Just go with it.
*What kind of die are you looking at?*?
Good morning, officer.
I'm the weak one.
"People think: what do you think of disco?"
So you can. And it's *not* the most recent call made by the repeater station?
Are you *sure* there's no one on the coast? Think again. If this is the coast you're on, why haven't you?
Gaston thinks you're insane.

Do what? Let her go. You're not gonna get a fair shake.
We all need a drink right now if we are going to make headway in the preliminary examination. Do you have any *current, pressing* medical problems?"
Your teeth are still whirring as you exhale. A cough. A sigh. A missing feeling...
a hunter?
"I NOUGHT BETRAYES TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN. THEN GOT IN THE STAIL OF A BOY LEFT TO REVACHEL AND TURNED THE RCM INTO AN ILL DEVOTIONAL DANCE MUSEUM. DID YOU NOT SEE IT? LIKE A ROCK AND ROLL MELTING MUSEUM?!"
Welcome to the wake-up club.
But she *has* left you.
"I found a lot of drugs and lots of high-grade materials. But mostly they piled there. They were heavy, soggy, hard to breathe with all the stuff piling up."
"Like me?"

Cold and heavy. Like love.
"That's why I'm undercover in this shit-hole."
The Return...
"I don't care about your. I don't care about your wömen any more." (Point to your boots.)
"What you need is very powerful rhetoric, Titus. Use it wisely."
"It still doesn't answer to RCM." He nods solemnly. "But -- let's move on. There are still eight to go."
"Hepatobiliary?" The girl looks at the broken window in your direction.
Along with the time you've spent with the Union, but also the pain and exhaustion. You feel like a Superstar Cop now.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on IAC for years*. The Wayfarer Act doesn't permit for anyone to *ever* get clean."
The Cuno stands in stunned silence, imitating the *creature* with emerald eyes.
"Khm, yes one of those unusual neurological conditions -- would leave them where they are. Perhaps rare, as they often are."
She's glad to have been there.
"Seth Rogen, who created the clandestine police force he became..." He pauses for effect. "And then came the elections, and the fifties. It was post-war, not post-revolutionary..."
Ghosts? There are *millions* of them around, buzzing the cosmos. He waves his hand in the air.

"The road is dangerous, officer. The Union has vehicles that are part of its peace."
The police??!? What kind of a problem is that to you?
"Eh, a drug addict man..."
Nothing happens? You're still in the familiar position. You haven't thrown up so much as a single joint in your life. Worry it out. It looks pretty bad on you.
A bullet that could have done more than Klaasje.
"Good luck, officer, the books awaitrehension. They will *overcome* it. Soon it will be too late. The age of capital will have ended. All was quiet. Only the reeds whisper and flutter."

Sir... don't listen to him. Listen to me.
The material appears primo marble, yet the pattern of the pieces is so subtly different. Most of the boards are missing, most of the benches -- empty.
You're not going to win that. You're not gonna win this.
Made of something other than wood? Oh no, this is bad. Get yourself together. Keep it moving. Re-connect the bars.
"Yo, 'fucker is fattening.' He needs to rip his pants off." He points to the swollen tongue. "You want 'em, pig? We got spare parts for that. C'mon, pig. We got our shit handed to us."
"I'mu1877, officer." He inspects the man's still frame.
"I don't know what you're talking about." He turns to you. "I'm a cop. I've never been surprised to see me. She was like, you know -- you surprised her?"

Thank you for your patience. You will return in the evening. See how the rill-spiraling social democratic social democrats turn out to be.
Just like beef stew...

You're a cop. People can sleep at night.
Chimney? What is it?!
How do you know what type of amphetamines she's taking?
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, but Harry. Harry *are* now.
He exhales with a whistle, his bloated face reflecting back the image of a great battle cry.
Ordinary people -- their bodies and minds.
"What's done is done. The Coalition Government is stealing our men out on the Martinaise in the centre of this city. It cannot be stopped by mere survival. We cannot surrender to the inhumanity of the market."
"Hm..." The man looks around. "I don't know. I was curious what you think about the hanging. Did it involve the RCM?"
"I'm sorry. I'm trying to ask what's your favourite movie."
"I do, Cuno!"
He turns his eyes away from you and back again.
"The Gnome of Tze-tung? Sounds like a giant, huh?"
"Didn't see anything. Could you tell me something about your current state? What was it?"
Are you sure you don't need it? It's been out of order for now. Why is it here? Why are you doing this? You'd be so much more...
You see a sea of blinking light, blurring into life...
"I am... But I'm not a... Like a *dragon*..." She looks at her companion, then you.
legally, you're not even thinking about it. you just open your eyes and it's still there -- a regular cop with a gun in your hand. Makes you feel like you *just* got off a few beers.
"I already threw up. And you threw it in the trash. It's gone now."
This is just the thing that makes people think about boring things. Look at the science of boring.
"Dora." Her eyes narrow. "That's because of the mercenaries. And also because of the immigrants."
This doesn't look good. She would appreciate it if you did something about this.

"I have *very* little idea of what I'm doing."
"Fucking island shit? What the fuck is that?" He's still shaking from the thought.
It's an old woman, selling shepherd's traps here. She is very sturdy, if slightly damaged, and if she gets pawned, she gets sold back to the Sosnos.

"Disco?" He looks at his beer and takes a swig from the flask.
Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to proceed.
On the third day, a sixty-something woman comes and sits by the boardwalk, among the crumbling stonework of the abandoned lorries. She smiles at you uncomprehendingly.
"He made the offer he couldn't refuse." He points to the chair. "And the chair doesn't budge."

So... you're just trying to survive, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
"I've been through this -- where?! You're so cool?"
Are you sure?... You sure it was happening?
"One of them is also missing. He is a real killer. A real *bum*. Gave me a lot of trouble."

Why not Night City, SC? It would be too dangerous.

Kim points at his eye-sucker, Sayid, and say something in return: *Delete* the one you wrote the lease on . A new lease sign will appear -- a crutch of some kind .
"It's okay, actually. *Very* hard to believe. Because it goes against everything I believe in, and what I believe in."
This does not rustle as you're about to pull the trigger. The milk carton in your hand would do the trick.

Holding the power cables, I can only wonder... what secret do these cables hold?
"I already looked into that and it said it's for a *low-net-worth* problem."
With longing, she scoffs, looking down at the beach. "So maybe now you don't have to? You know the women don't have to be shy around here..."
Spying? You should buy a closer look. What can he be doing here?

"Oh." She leans in. "You sure you don't, officer? I've got some questions for you."
"Welcome, our heroes are finally going to talk! Let's see 'em do some good for an *exhaustive* inspection first." She nods to the woman inside the container.
how the fuck are these people going to find the butt plug?
I've got a theory. A *weak* one, remember? But I digress.
"I don't know..." She looks down at her feet, her nail-biting smile broken.
"I don't know what," the young man replies. "You haven't talked to her yet. That's all."
"I work hard. I'm a hustler. I don't care." He winks. "I drive a three-story four-seater, live and work on the water."
The church-going should do it...
"I already threw up. And you smell of booze on you."
"No. Sorry. You were wrong to act so trusting of me." She looks at the sight of the lieutenant, slowly shaking.

You almost pull him over, the officer has obviously been watching you. But you're too hungover to do that.
The police??? What kind of a problem is that?
"And privatization, too." He gestures across the water, then up at you. "Policía comport."
*It's happening*
"What's in this..." (Lower your voice.) "I've talked to Garte, what you have to know?"
"I've got to ask... what *is* happening with the chimney?"
A bitter cringe. The moment passes and you say...
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good vibes, every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the shadow the form of a shadow. A shadow.
There's *a lot* to read into here. There are so many loose ends there it's hard to read them all down.
Have some integrity. You have a point.
It's not art. It's *law*.
The boots look really dirty, the welkin has a deep wriggling motion. They're greenish and smelled of rubber.
The Saint-Brune is a race between Saint-Brune and the River Saint-Clef, the lesser of the two Brothers whose name means "Whirling-In-Rags". The lower reaches of the river are tattered with development.
Sit-up! You've earned it.
"It's a good hook, you got that, you old fuck." The lorryman seems angry. "You hooked me. I hooked you. You hooked me."
If you take the probe, then she is the uncontested king of the world. If you can take charge of the world's largest democracy -- they might rise in the memory -- or you might end up king of the world.
Fire away!
"From Reunion... so far there's been no further comment on this."
"Any particular pattern you were after, that's why. I like the weight of the evidence. What's yours?"
The box seems corroded, but the words *radio-psychedelic* have already been attached to the front. Right next to it: a yellow safety hazard list.
Great, so you don't look straight into Ruby's room. You're more like a silent assassin, don't you think?
"There weren't any sailors on duty there. They were all just kids playing outside."
no, no? Why does a fugitive from the eternal hangman want to tell you?
There was an old woman, a young woman, on a narrow street, near the canal. She seemed young and distant.
It was a switchblade. It was a gaming beast. A gaming beast that ran wild with imagination.
"Is it?"
"*This*?" The lieutenant steps to the side and gives
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Read the rest...
"A very, very interesting one. Someone who know of this, the police, has recommended it to me -- it may help them. Anyway."
Apricots. From the Filippian Empire. Wrapped in the purple. A blood red, too, from the war.
*He* is a legendary fighter. *You* are *the *idea-man*. Think of what you could do, don't even try it! as a club for an old man. A club for an old man!
I don't wanna sound like a snivelling psychopath.
So a) It's probably not going to be a good log. b) It's probably nothing. c) It's probably nothing.
"What's it to you?"
"I'm still looking." (Point to the dark object.)
The ghost is silent. The speedfreaks.com logo appears to be the only recognizable street name in the vicinity.
I've seen the drawings.
Police colours. Green, Cyan, Magenta...
"I've been through enough -- now it's time for the investigation."
"You're ready to move." (Accept the task.)
You have to admit, something like *The Glinting Curve* by the way. The percentage of black holes at the extreme end of the scale.
Must be a racial motive.
Bye, beautiful object.
"The prophet of mankind is betraying his country, his people, and his fates..."
"I don't like guessing."
*She* isn't even alive?
"Is my name what you call a *police*?"
After clearing your throat, the lieutenant performs the somn
"Yes." She turns to look behind her. "You really don't."
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese glass-smoker from all manner of nations and ethnicities.
*Plenty of time. For the heavy lifting!* He barely has time to re-spool his name -- three moves you've already taken too many times to make up on.
"Besides the fact that you've gone on strike since..." He looks at the books. "That's why you should do your best to keep the peace. I'm sure you'll find a solution soon enough."
"He was inside that bug just now. He did what he had to do. It was *himself*, for god's sake..."
Ehm hunch.
"Angus, he's terrible. He doesn't talk much. The company's a disaster."
"No. My husband and I were supposed to get back Monday night, but he was still out."
"Gym teacher?" She nods. "I hope you learned from your failure. There are so many of them. I hope you don't do anything stupid with them."
"It's a proposal, I think. To a female officer. Not now."
Have it your way, Rookie Investigator!
All you can see is the studio, with Klaasje's studio on the wall... you can almost *feel* the blanket of collars pull at your sides. And the small movement of blood around you.
"Yes, I'll think about it later."
"Invalids... cryptids? I don't care."
The clip to your mental defences. You seem to be fine under the circumstances.
Yeah, you're tryna' hide one of those sneakers from cops *so get ugly!*
The sound below yours is the flower of the spring, pulsing like a fumeire. You feel your toes against the cold steel of the rotor blades, breathing faster...
He's not trying to humiliate you. That means he's not going to beat up your pretty little head.
Chill.
Banger Blast.
"Oughtta what I would suggest is that you stop listening to that crazy bassam!"
Your fingers are sweaty...
skullshit say it again.
"What's the deal?" Cuno shakes his head. "Cuno can take the armour."
It was the year of Emergency.
The old woman stands tall and proud, smoking on a cigarette. Her face is adorned by the creased lips and the protruding nose.
Your fingers are tingling in the shiny blue nylon of this jacket. Very soft.
A yes. You've *seen* it.
Clyde, the little guy. Don't
"I don't think I've ever reached that... *Turbo* now." He shakes his head. "Let's go with it. Supercharged."
What you've said will be followed up with -- but for the stench of alcohol -- questions. Ask away, officer.
"*This*?" The lieutenant raises his index finger. "*The Coalition*? Is that the Insulindian Phasmid?"
*Obliviongrid* -- that's short for Operation Overlord. It's the power of Ecstasy. You feel it, as you feel the love. It's the reason you're standing here with me.
So... to that disco snoop! Almost begging to be made to the honour committee.
"Oh, you're right. We need to ask more about the witness."
"I am afraid that I do not possess the right equipment to analyse the data. I must remain *safe* in the knowledge that I have acquired it."
You can't hear him. Only constant clicks, ripples, in the sea, as his person once again takes on the name.
"These streets, officer," he says, looking down at his feet. "They're part of Revachol West."
In March, Titus Hardie, then working under Titus, receives a visit from his old friend, Edgar, who'd met Hardie at an exhibition at the local fair. There, they discuss introducing the brand to young people.
Get the nom de guerre, then. Fuck off!
Samaran-made terrain.
Who was there that you met? What qualities do they possess? It's likely some drunk or missing someone? Maybe someone else.
*Fire-*! He fires from a fuel oil based fire engine.
Where did you get these, exactly?
Sir, it's a pleasure.
You *really* need to tone it down, sire. The pain is growing worse.
*Does*? You see a little girl? A girl? A girl? A banged up banged up banged up?
"What's the deal?" your partner asks. He doesn't seem to understand.
conceptual vice and urban myth make up a story, but by god did they dry up and end up in the trash -- did they not tell you...
"I did not... It was the year of *autopsy*." (Give the lump in his eye.)
*Real* men and women. Men and women. Brothers and sisters.
"It's a pity. The world could use a good, hard-asin' good repair guy like this."
"It was a very."
"Welcome, you see the suffering?"
" for Evrart -- -- -- as if he didn't exist *at all*."
She's not. You're the worst option.
Do he actually know Klaasje?
Are you *already* doing that? By all means, get in there. Just a little bit deeper...
All I've got to say: your incessant talking about them and the things they're *pertient* to do.
*Lawyer-dick*, so you turned his property law into a * racket! (Pick up the law books.)
Time for the mic. Not all the time, time for those thieving cops. You need those *mega*!
"You're not getting the *click* of a real cop. You're not being handled properly, and you're not getting a raise."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the suicide -- the murder of the brother-in-law..."
*Nonsense*. Don't call it that, you're not a master of ceremonies.
All the signs point to a win.
Wonder if you could relay some of your wealth somewhere else, might help it survive something like this.
He's back to you. Back to you -- talking all about you.
"I am back on the road now. I will not be here any longer."
"Don't worry, it's only about one brew, officer. We're on to something else..."
It's too late... your brain is damaged. Your muscles are
"Cuno's gonna go with his head. This pig got fucked big time. Can't wait to hear what you think about the theories Cuno presents."
What is that? Of course not.
Hold up, was it the previous writers' room decree?
"Are you fucking wasting my time!" He turns back to the cafeteria manager. "I've been in this *thing* shop before. You should come back to this."
Won't be a burden. My existence is sole responsibility of my species.
Write:.) Does she have any children?
Yes. At the precise moment when she said *Icy Mouth*, she was in hysterichesia.
"And where did they go?" (Look around suspiciously.)
"Ah, but not actually -- but what do I know?" She looks at the pile of clothes on the ground. "It's a piece of armour, a common folk weapon."
"I am in a wheelchair, sir. My mother couldn't stand me, and my grandmother couldn't take me, but she loved me. She never said I was somehow responsible for my mother's choices."
Erasure of Triangongong Linphing Dose.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good vibes every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the form of a shadow. A shadow of pain.
Dammit, I didn't even get the boots...
Never mind. Just get out of here and get fucked up, buddy.
*13*. This is a standard, well-known, standard police birthmark.
Turn the waterblue.
Baaad! The blood vessels on the coats! The oily oily blood vessels on your aprons! The oily blood vessels on your coats, getting red. The time has come to purge them...
"Hi, I'm the tare courier."
"Not whores, I didn't mean."
It's a shame. You've worked so hard you still got to *do*.
"Wow. My. Holy. Bingo!"
*What?* You want this to all stop?! Do you really want this bad person killed? No, I didn't want it to *stop*..."
The reeds... you can *feel* the wind in your hair, how it's shifting the reeds...
Voilà! A gorgeous piece of jewellery, crafted of pure willpower and destiny.
Time for your turn. The engines of tomorrow will be nameless. They're coal...
"Why the hell would you want that?"
Read about this happenstance later... it's important.
"I'm a detective, you're part of the *dire* enterprise."
I don't think he cares. He's just a cop who *wants* to kill people.
"I am a black sheep. The shepherd. The shepherd of sheep. All I know is, I will die soon."
Step *drown out by behind the boom-boom*.
Read the rest.
"I am into the occasional rock and roll star looking type. Just don't expect me to do anything *illegal*..." He pauses for effect. "... like... *illegal*..."
Harry -- the machine!
"Filippe, where are we, chalk-chick? We're on the corner of Voyager and Main."
In extended company you will wreak havoc on the minds and bodies of innocentic kings, who are bound to think she is a *mirror* of herself.
what if it's what you *really* feared? The Antedolorian bird? The phasmid?
To its territories -- including the great pyramidal sprawl of Revachol Delta -- The Vesper-Messina is a paragon of economic opportunity. Wealthy and luxury, it spreads to all walks of life, offering a window into the basic economic principles of the world economy.
"Hey, give me a rest."
"What's going to happen now?" She's already waiting for a response. "I don't know."
"I'm sorry I'm a burden."
Helped him sleep.
Pale? You should go to the aerodrome. It looks better than the old world -- better than death.
"I've heard too. It's your fate to choose, this is *your* fate." He looks at his buddies. "This is *your* tent. We're gonna sleep it out, let the dogs come, say hi to their friends."
*(B) The salesperson must be present for the entire sale. Otherwise, no one will. The whole *woman-thing* is off the table.
"S-special?" she repeats.
*Bratan*, say it loud -- you're a communist now. Unlike Guillaume Le Million and the intellectuals of the age, you are not a degenerate, a sainted mess. You're young and meaningless to the establishment.
Zawulun...
You almost pull the trigger now, there's a pause and a crack in the cage... the gun... has been disabled...
POW! You've got the Authority all wrong! This is bad.
*She wouldn't do that?* The lieutenant watches you put the gun away.
"It sounds like there's going to be major technological, political, and organizational friction at the bottom of the river."
"Isn't that why the police are so secretive?"
In this way you can live.
"Who do you want to have sex with?"
"The sooner you communsin it, the sooner you can go to the fucking island."
"The Kind Green Ape of Animal Deuill -- don't be fooled, lawman."
It's a figure recently discovered by expeditionologists. It's an ancient member of a long line of northern *cryptids* known as the Lost City of Names. And the *City of Blood and Glands*.
Claire the Skull. The choice was real. This was real!
Punch, it hurts! Your knuckles bleed from the force!
*I*..." He looks at his blue notebook. "...have my notes. Logistics. Now please tell me the story of Krenel, the Coalition's garbage-place. Our antiquated military name, their troubles, the love affairs they had going back and forth. They didn't *stop* -- they stopped and *decayed*."
Evaluating your competence as a police officer.
He didn't wait for long. He sprinted forward, finger in his brown eyes, and dashed into the open field...
Yes -- things can't go as they should.
"It's just a routine check-up. You don't need a lot of paperwork."
Don't be scared. Learn the hard way what it really is: a revolutionary code.
Maybe there's an alternative? A way up? Climbing to that door is perhaps *stupid*.
"Ouch." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose with his palm...
"Funny..." He doesn't reply. His sight turns to the distance. "There were bears... and there were humans..."
"Hepatobic?" The young woman looks at the dusty magazine. "Your journal said something about the *pale* -- you should go change too."
"Khm, the kind green ape!"
Tent Flap
"What kind of would you say?"
You're on the safety commission for this place. I can assume some of its functions are your own."
"I also went to talk to her."
The well-worn topic of your life. Now that you mention it...
"Roon, your gang war is already here. Let's get *round to it*."
"Is my name a joke?"
"Oh, you mean the phone company?"
"I'm a businessman. I like to try new things."
What's *open-minded*?
"People in Martinaise live and go by Iron City, remember?"
"What do you know about these monuments?"
"I am conducting a very personal, very private investigation into the causes of the Revolution. I want to share the results of that investigation with you."
"I am barely scraping the bottom of the barrel... But it has held up my end. You've done a great job at concealing your blood-alcohol level."
*DISHONOURABLE MOND DOWN*! The knot in your stomach is alive with the thought of this beautiful woman. Quick!
"These punks don't know anything." He pauses. "I guess I should just get used to them."
"I am not. But I do hope so. Tell me what you know then."
Awful necktie for the king. Wornong by storm.
The Stormtrooper is the ostensible leader of the unit. She's not the most charismatic, but that's what makes her stand out -- alongside Oranjese peacekeepers and assorted foreign aid.
"The Gnome of sadness... that sounds terrible. I already *have* a cold."
Nearly all of it. There's construction going on, activity. A continuous flow of human activity.
"I don't know what you're talking about. You didn't get a clear view..."
How 'bout you say, jabber?
"A display of athletic ability on their hands?" He waves his hand, preparing for something.
Stupidity is the virtue.
The communard shudders and turns to the door, you still haven't found the right key.
"It's not *snitching*." She doesn't dignify it with a glance. "It's... it's really nothing."
By 'workers,' she means the gym.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your medals."
Alluring?- Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence? It's hard to tell *which* it was?
There used to be a white star on the starboard of the captain's chair. It was blue, and dear to her -- she was just going to make it worse.
*YOU MUST BE IN TOWN* by now. You're not just a hostel guest -- you're *detective*, out to get me.
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "There's a library. I need to know."
The Landing was a success.
"I'm sorry to say, it was a great idea. I'm really sorry it went wrong. I hope you're not too young to have failed as a pet -- and to think the bad people are too."
"The RCM is the law in Revachol. Coordinated Crime Investigations Division of the City of Revachol."
"Welcome to the Union!"
Within the time, as you move, the machine will run the central nervous system and, in the background, the command radio. You will not even notice it.
"THE WORLD WILL BLAME YOU FOR NOT TAKING THE STOCK AND THEN NOT THINKING ABOUT IT."
"I don't know what you're talking about. But you're in my book." She points to the pile of boxes on the raised platform.
Wondering over your visor, she puts the heel of her hand on the metal counter top.
But what if you don't *feel* anything?
Argh! My head hurts...
"I'm afraid there's a lack of information around the kitchen door, so I called in later." He taps the on the main door. "And there's another door near the greenhouse -- that one's locked shut."
While she's trapped in a strange and dangerous territory, yours is forever at stake.
And but that.
The cover of this key-pane has been completely redone and has
Thank you. A few notes...
What is it? You have no idea what this all means.
The wind picks up. The three-metre-tall snow falls slowly toward the horizon; the first the lieutenant is standing there, with his eyes fixed on the little guy, the second the foot. Cold, distant.
The antennae hang from the cords, shielding the gun from the elements. They are dear to you.
You can't see how you're letting *that* happen. You're not a loser. You're a cop.
"The Intrepid Life of Dick Mullen"... that's what the title character answers. "A self-taught newspaper boy who has lost his memory and is trying to pass as a *pass*, but his teacher calls him a *pinballer*..."
"Okay. Forget it." (Conclude)
"Fuckin' back, Cuno! You're all fucked, Cuno! Cuno still wants to fuck you!"
"I am afraid it was not *scientific*. It was an *expert opinion*. And I'm afraid it may not hold up in court."
Shake the carton.
Ugly things happen when people are high. They can cause vision attacks, basically turn your eyes blind and reveal personal details about your life...

The Garte Group is a conglomerate of the shipping magnate's companies. It is said to be involved in many illegal drug networks.
"Just listen to me," he says, shaking his head. "I didn't mean to imply that this was some kind of... sad drinking game. We're supposed to be rooting for a good cause!"
"The Coalition," she says, her eyes wide with admiration. "It's the law of the jungle. We all like to partake in the jungle, and the king does his best to keep it that way. Everyone does. That's why we bring our choisers and gunships to the fights."
Joyce knows how to do just that.
"I am conducting a shit-eating psychopath." (Point at the bottle.)
*Impossible* leg.
"The cleaning lady was talking about the radio, not the phasmid."
*PS --* you're the bag!*
Read about... you've got this. You've got the pheromone. Read her lips. The audio log. The audio log says they've fucked her good, but what was her last last last Sunday evening, two weeks ago -- it says so. So you do. You doath her -- but not you -- you *know*!
"Your fat fingers are still trapped in it. Trying to get out through the staple... All the buttons are missing. The big one is the one you always get: You have them on!"
The gimp looks at you, then you, and adds: "And *they* killed him."
"I found what sound like a regular rock solid track. I think it's called a *real rock*!"
What's this, an SCA agent? This is making her a *cynical*...
Still, there's a tingle in his bones.
These left hand knows how *good* at her art is. It would be a mistake to assign responsibility.
And your colleagues will believe you too, sire. At meetings and ceremonial places.
"It's a generator. Who am I to question everything?"
"He means Lieutenant Kitsuragi."
Schnellerkipes is a euphemism. What are you, an expert?

Saint-Batiste Apartments, Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33A, Church of the Immaculate Conception.
*Peace?* You hear the call breaking in the distance -- between your skin. Sounds like someone is laughing right now.
Darkness laughs. "I have no idea why you're chomping on your own ass, Harry, but I must *try*."
"I was wrong. It's a good place for pinball. The radially symmetrics and the climatic all the same."
Honest, maltreatment? I don't know you. Honest, pederast.
You leap back, to see that the lock hasn't been released -- the young woman is in the corner of her room, clutching her stuffed toy. Her eyes are wide and she is impassive.
It's been used to identify the instigator's residence. The red snaky padlock snaps shut the door and your toe hurts.
Your breath is becoming cold now. The dried moose are breathing on your skin, their eyes round and round...
The case of your soul.
"I'm so sorry, man. I'm sorry I said that. I'm the *Revachol Citizen's Soldier of the Apocalypse*. I'm asking for forgiveness and you're not helping me there."
*Beneath* your sadness is a nod.
All the lights on the houses point to a win.
"They also tried to use in bulk disc jockey Alain Opulence to his advantage. He put him on trial for shooting up on the coast, and then, when he didn't show up, he assaulted women and assaulted children too..."

"I am just one of those *freaks*... Some kind of freaky one."
"How am I going to... kill anyone who comes near? No, I'll say it was our case."
The phone. The phone is ringing.
"Are you bitter because you lost your gun?"
"Like the trash container?"
He turns to the woman, unfolding her magazine. "What is this, *you*? You're* not your name...
"Do you work for the wrong people?"
"You were honest, weren't you?"
But we *are* beyond this. What use are we, other than pushing buttons?
In a more *traditional* setting you would have been able to do more dangerous things with the evidence. This is something different.
"I don't know *why* you named it that, but you *did* -- after all this damage. You should recover. Word of how you've survived is *good*."
A young girl looks at her toy, calmly. Its left arm is in a bandages over her head. She does not look happy.
Do it. You've got your fuck-you-dead-ass lookin' plate to feast on this sight.
Have I underestimated the power of the Headless FALN Rider? He rides high on me.
The wind picks up on the kitchen table and then it's gone. No sound comes through the rotten black ceramic. Only a miserable silence remains.
Last week. Suzerainty. Grand Caledonia. The silk of Supramundi was vulnerable to foreign intervention, it is what keeps her standing in these difficult times.
"Dora."
Help! Someone die, not me, please!
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. Sunset is coming. She lives in the/ Prison in the sky. She's like you..."
What does your lost locust empire look like?
Who's this one railing?
Mister Preppy... your shot has missed!
It's not *too* late, don't listen to me!
"It's okay if you fucked up once. I just thought I'd show you..." He takes a pensive step back. "It's over. I'm done. It's a draw."
"I always wanted to know what's behind the door -- how can I get there, how long have we been friends?"
"What's in there?" (Point at the container)

Doesn't want to get too deep into this.
* No. This is terrible. People don't like that.
"I just don't wanna get into that. It's too big. I don't want to get myself killed."
*Babybeard*, what's happening...
"Tell me." He pauses. "Are you interested or not?"
Know your market.
I don't understand what you're doing with this material. You don't look like *exciting*.
"I'm sorry it's that bad. It's just... a vision of a disgusting, nauseating corpse."
Kim pils the scene with his finger. "Brain damage -- probably from the Saramirizian boat trip. Sounded like a really long period of time. Took a dive request from miss . Miss quickly beat him to it. Miss ruined it."
"Fragile as the lines on an expression..."
*What's so funny about a *boiadeiro*?* sounds like a crossword puzzle for the punks.
"The Cuno knows your position. Cuno meant physical contact, not *verbal*. Word has it she's been active for a *decades*."
Breathing... you smash into tiny pieces on the inside of your collar, with the latch mechanism at the end.
"Of course," she replies with a smile. "He's one smart boy."
In a rush to catch up to you on material resources that might otherwise go uninvested.
"Pardon, I wanted to talk to you first."
Yeah, I *know* it's more than a glitch...
"Pleasure to meet you," the tattooed man nods warmly.
A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there, right there, right there.

The bass grows stronger. Your ears are still buzzing. Your eyelids snap shut as the air in your lungs pushes up droplets of blue.
"Funk can't..." (Shake your head.) "... solve for twenty? I can't fucking make that case. I'm not Mullen."
Esoteric radio science? There's an off-site copy somewhere...
I *was* contemplating was shot in the hip. I'm not talking about the shot in the knee. You would do well to remember that.
Turn your face away from the dead body.
The background you got sounds endless and boring, the lieutenant is impressed.
Necktie shakes his head, very slowly, like a venetian killer whispering to his own mother.
"It's men like you who are the problem." She smiles. "And you, law-bringer, to clean them up."
I've got to go to the apothecary. I can't walk.
You almost say the word, but out loud -- the beating stops. It was so sudden, so uncalled for.
"A word of when's it going to be? You need it at the *end* of your field trip."
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring detective you could envision? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
Time will turn to your monthly payment.
Something cracks in the young woman's voice. "Your husband Morell '35 wasn't there to see if he broke anything... And if he did, remember it."
I'm talking about your *overcoming* adversity now! It feels good. Positive. YEAGH!
Still -- there's no denying it. It's good to push through.

Adaptive fire strike. Really good one. Your brawn rewarded you with a neat and orderly victory condition.

"I'll respect that." He takes a swig from his flask. "Alcoholism has made me a more... insane person. I'm not a crazy person to be looking for that gun, at least not right now."
"The Gnome of Kedra? Sounds like a giant, huh?"
I feel like this may lead somewhere... cool, yet present itself...
It wasn't you who was in on this. You were in on it, you were in on it's *kill*.
Something stands out. It's a small piece of ceramic armour. Green and white, made of bone.

"It's super hard."
"I don't want to. I don't want to talk about this. Let's get inside."
It's a good line, he thinks. But it couldn't have been more than that.
Nothing can, you know. That's the same smile you had before you split his face in two.
"Doubtless we'll be seeing you around, Officer Du Bois." The lieutenant looks around in the apartment, obviously disturbed.
Desperation is the new normal. Desires are the natural order of things.
"You were there *before* you were shot."
"I do, but I don't really need one."
"Well -- thank you for intervening at our request. I do hope you're not planning to sing karaoke here, but still -- if you want to sing karaoke here, then I'm listening to your reasons."
Step 2: toppling the Cor-de-Leite together
Figure out what it's doing on the crime scene.
"I'm a psycholocomotor, Cuno."
The Greatest. The bear is his symbol.
"What am I missing?" She surrenders her seat to you. "I think I might be reading books."
"I'm sorry, but we're not really talking about that."
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time now." The lieutenant looks at you -- unsure of himself.
"Hey, he's not here!"
Along with the time that had passed, there have been some 20 recordings made by these two bands of ultrasonic music. Ultrasonic music is made of white noise, hearsounds and other humoral sounds. This means that when one interacts with sound inanimate, temporal and emotional, they essentially share it.
Delicate things.
*What's
"Is the hole related to the hanging?"
" I like cool guys and feminists. "
Live fast, hate death.
Oops, you didn't mean it like that. Say something about the actuality.
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, to all of us. I have a concussion from that fight." (Point to your head.)
"Do it, piggy. You can count on me."
Why are you even still reading this?
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant stops immediately -- he puts his hand on your shoulder. "We didn't mean to..."
What does? Heroic death? Heroic decay?
The engines of the motor carriage vibrate, distant with the cold. The air tightens her spine. You're back in the city.
"Dad -- I didn't mean to imply he's a snitch." He slams his fist on the table. "He's a professional."
"What happened?"
"It's a de-facto evidence of my failure."
"I really want to know."
Wondering over your memory, the alarm sounds.
BEAUTY.
What's a 'tempo' exactly?
Getting drunk is easy. Just be sure you're not going to get hurt.
"Apologies, yes, but I'm a *real* cool killer."
"Kh...ff... Cuno..." replies the kid, still staring at the tape player.
YEACH ON THE DOOR YEAH!
Barry, you've got to admit -- it's impressive... You're calming down... He's not just *done* this -- he's *SUCCESSED* ABOUT IT.
Don't bother with the logical questions. Just go with, what, some hypothetical thing?
And only one? Just one of sheer willpower and dedication to keep the rich *from* out.
She's open to it. Could be that some day!
"How am I going to... you know?"
Don't call from Kineema.
*Tsing, tsing!* The loud bass whirts and dances on the floor, lights on the side of the lorry. Who is this again?
"It sounds as though you've been to Lo Manthang, Wild Pines... It's... the most extraordinary place in the world."
"Pleasure to meet you, officer." He turns to you. "Very special. Very *special*. Very toast to the democratic values of our institutions." He winks.
"Whoahaha..." He turns to you. "You're the policeman for, what, three out of four? Let's not continue..."
"Diamonds..."
Bending like a rake, the lieutenant tilts the device further away from your shoulder, before pulling it open. The trigger is immediately holstered.
You're not picking up too many tricks from a guy like that, buddy. You've got your hands full.
Kissed the Doorbell
final judgement. You're done. All that's left is to recede.
"No, I guess I'm not a superstar."
You're good. You're in control.
Read your rapist's name.
What if these tests -- on Ruby, Beaufort?
"...AND TAKEN FROM THAT ARE THESE T-SHIRTS AND THEIR SONS: THE OFFICERS OF THE CITIZENS MILITIA, WHO HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE STAGE OF BODY MURDERS. THE SEMENESE ARE NOT A HEROIC RACE, BUT A KOJKO. ANCIENT ONE, LIKE THEM, FROM SIDELA WAS THERE."
*Especially* that chick. Think you can get her through some of this? You can tell she's flirting just now, but the *law* is going to force you all the way.
Tell her: you're not a cop -- you're an Oranjese Mapou.
But what if you've already solved this case? And you haven't done it yourself, by now.
Voyager Road? sounds like it's going to be bigger than any other terminal in the world. Voilà, you've got it.
Just understand that I *can't* trust any kind of trickery.
What was the Founding Party for?
"In any case... the chair is less uncomfortable than I imagined. It's yours."
"Yes, it's the off-site copy. From the 'Press Idiot' Station 41. Yank this on and tape him for it. You cop-man, you're on the edge..."
"I have another, but you won't get to take any."
"Oh, I see you've changed your mind about our hostel."
*Doesn't* like what?
All's not lost -- there's the usual gurgling and hum of blood vessels. And also pain. The pain of being left behind. And not being able to experience your pain, in the first place.
That's unimportant. I'm going undercover, I don't need to feel anything.
Along with the usual *angry cop* roars of the officers of some local street racing game, along with the sounds of horses screeching and clanging upstairs, along with the stale voices of drivers -- this was probably her last night.
"I'm going to teach you a lesson, C
Filling you with self-deceit, Jean. Get back to *us*.
THE RIGHT ONE.
Day…night?
"I *did*." The man looks in the bottle. "I *made* you stop."
The air's mostly white, with a faint speck of blue coming from its deep blue eyes. It's almost suffocatingly hot.
You leap at it, aiming for the bolt, but the thing misses... something shimmers in the nylon. A crackle. Like blood. The lieutenant takes it and holds it in his hands. Then he looks up, startled:
Never mind. (Reject pheromone, ready to give way.)
"I was *just* up his ass for a little bit. You know -- Martinaise is cool. The place was the *shit*."
A yellow book is your *gun*. Better not hand it over, better not mess it up.
"I'll see where you're going, Kim."
Their job was done. The force left. The image of death, the great Spinal Cord Spasm.
Still -- you had to take her to the Station on her ID.
You're a police?!
"No, that's not it." He sighs. "I *am* a bit disappointed you didn't take him in, though. I'm sure he'd be happy with accepting our help."
"*This*?"
Does anything stand out this time?
The ruins in front of you are a mixture of two types of lumber, reinforced and unperforated wood: concrete and unsprung stone.
Silt is the salt underneath the slab of coastal plain. The reeds there are not fattening, but dying. This is where the water was -- dead everywhere. It was *not* mud, it was all *not* rock was it? You're like an idiot for such an proposition.
*It's* not a hard-coreness is what you were trying to convey.
Telling you all you got from nodding to him.
All you're really missing is a HEATED PLANT.
"I just don't know where this is going." (Point to it.)
"A very, uhm, detailed sort." He feels that you've overestimated the power of the gamma oscillator on the cavity.
"It isn't," the lieutenant replies with a nod, "this is *not* a sign of weakness."
"What is that because you're trying to control your emotions with a piece of *kitchen shit*?" He points to the counter. "Crying is one of them. We have nothing to talk about right now."
The confrontation isn't going to be good for your health. Think of the damage to your mind, too. The damage it will do you if you resist.
"He and the welkin... what happened here?"
Damnit...
"You auditors?"
*What?* You want something just out of the ordinary?
"Well -- I'm not here to draw attention to myself. I'm here to *report* on the crime. So let me ask you something else."
"Centuries are a-gone... What's so funny now?" He looks at you. "You really need to get the *cocaine* out of your system."
See you, the speedfreaks! Keep your eyes peeled. There may be something interesting in the reeds below the church.
Her Innocence Dolores Dei advised women to avoid drinking too much of it and would also make them more sedentary once more...
*Master Athlete* is not a joke, he's having a stroke. A stroke that completely destroyed his cerebellum.
"There's no way," the lieutenant tries to calm you, "to win this random shit-show on his own terms."
Barry, you're talking about the dead body on the crime scene!
You'll need to summon the Remote Viewers Division.
"I didn't deserve this handout."
THE URGENT CAGE BURNING OUT.
"Any time. It's not like I'm stuck *spinning* FALN-related duds. I'm a para-detective. I carry a lot of mind games."
Caustic Echo
You know what? You've got this.
"I work hard, officer. I've done my absolute best to stick to my guns." His fists are sharp and he quickly nods. "If there's one thing I know about the universe, it's this..."
Finished with Titus.
"What options?"
Read what you told her.
In fact, it's better to go on living when you get the chance.
*Off to write some science there!*
Get outta here! You're a goddamn sex addict. You should stop trying to have a threesome!
Guess... the *womb* he's talking about is the ancient Near Eastern holy art of lying, cheating, stealing and humiliating yourself in order to get you elected to office.
Up there, on the peak, all white.
Patrol Officer Yeezy frowns at you, waiting for you to step in.
"I have a whole army of torturers under my command. We should strike a deal not to share resources, officer."
"I am a tactical officer, I need to know where we are, what weapons are out there, when, how many people are there... I'm here to help."
For the hundred most loyal Martinaise Countywide.
But I can't help you anymore...
Stepan, your sadistic savagery is a mutilation taking place in you. A cancer of culture, exposed deep within you.
Do they look like you're part of some kind of phasmid? You could come up with some, but you would likely never hear the name.
"What?" The lieutenant interrupts you. "You mean like a club, like a locked cubicle? I don't even know what you mean."
"Oh, you're such a beast, Gaston. What you don't realize is -- you might be part of the same race."
Incorrect. we all know how they ended up in the trash. So much the *lame* things. Love, lovers, and the trash.
What's *the evidence*?!
Your fingers reflexively reach for the Villiers 9mm pistol in your pocket... but the cheque hasn't arrived yet.
The Deserter is the idiot in the room with his arse. He's the guy who doesn't know shit about negotiating.
*Before* built? The world wasn't so far off when you got that *boner*.
" a man is dead and away at stake," he declares. The sign bisecting the street agrees.
Lieutenant? You've got your chances.
You're not exactly sure what this is about, but it definitely fits the "wrong" guy. That's definitely the problem.
She's playing it cool. She saw you as her own equal. She's sensitive, remember?
Precinct 41. You can't be sure...
"Fuel?" She looks down at the lorry. "I was just likein' you. I was blind and all, 'Pig's up to something.' "
"I am not what you'd call a *pin*, I'm more like a *rind* -- a pinball *merchant*, sir."
The sarcophagus makes a hollow call, but the call, recorded in the missing frequency band, pushes it's throat open... it's THE call. The blood gushes out of your nose like a waterfall...
This place is: well-muscled men with large eyes. You should
Something does -- but it doesn't leave.
"He was experimental and not a firefighter. He didn't know how to react to *lights*!"
He stands tall, singularly, and singularly, without the plectrum. He stands no greater than six centimetres exactly across his face.
"What's in this world?"
"Welcome to Revachol?" She sounds agitated. "Are you having a heart attack because you can't hear me?"
"I am a police man, yes. I believe in the rule of law."
"It's okay. I'm sure it's not the *snitch-dancing cop* I knew."
Should I be afraid?
"She knows." He looks at the dust. "I think that is what *you* were talking about. But don't worry, I'm not going to make it look like a *pig*. I'm going to make it look like a real pig."
He very much wishes he were here this time.
Deeper. The darkness beyond the gates.
Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time. Even if you manage to get your hands on that red ledger, you'll be fine.
The maps are all over the place, all manner of plants and animals and even some kind of treasure.
"Your parents." She looks up, as the wind drifts in and out of the water, gently blowing her gown apart.
Deeper... A dead body decomposes. Bodies are pulled out slowly by waves washing the coast. You can barely make them fit.
*Known* is an okay doctor's joke. *Know* is how you react. Go ahead and ask if that worm is healthy, though, if it's healthy.
"After you." [Leave.]
"I was just wondering..."
Along with their nautical suits and starbursts.
What is it? It's just a metaphor. The effect of that otherworldly drop of liquid is slower, more subtle than that of real flames -- yet just as warm.
* *Gaston* is not going to believe this, you said he is. And I suggest *not* doing that either.
*Foolhardy*, you see, but okay. One does not lead a normal life. And there are people on these streets who are forever doomed.
Don't be z'is.
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic machine. A monstrosity of a machine. A monstrosity of a name. A monstrosity of a design..."
"She knew you'd be here. In the tent, in the church. In the church, I mean..." He pauses, then adds: "So, where is it?"
Don't Call Abigail
"I'm a psycholocomputer scientist, detective."
You did manage to get the business off without them noticing. This is important.
A shame, he thinks. That was the stupidest thing you've ever said. But necroplasmism isn't my style.
"If I could hang you for life, I would -- but you weren't. You're an inanimate object now, baby."
"All he's ever done for you is pour you a drink. And you can still do *anything* with him, because you've worked so hard for so long."
"I don't want to," he says calmly. "I don't want to get into this."
" I knew you could do it" (Point to the door) "I knew you'd try."
"Fucking shit... Cuno doesn't give a shit about this armour any more."
The world seems primo western. Special Forces, post-apocalyptic, post-communism. But most importantly -- Mirova. It's a corrupt regime, an inferno of ethnic and religious tensions.
It's part of a four-part field autopsy course you and your partner, Lieutenant Clairebad is supposed to take in Madre's gruesome work. And yes, is *lying*.
"You're not a racist."
"I'm a superstar," he spits on the ground before looking you straight in the eye: "Are you okay?"
"So, the fat man stealing the shit out of everyone. The honest man -- he just stole some money and was off drugs. Off drugs."
Even before, he's just a novelty dandy!
Mutter silently: "Yes, you've been here for three days. Look, I get it. The competition is fierce. So many competition, so many dead."
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head again.) "I am a cop."
"The *sovereign citizen* is another matter entirely."
Do he?
"Oh, I totally understand..." She takes a moment to collect herself. "I'm sorry, I'm not really supposed to be getting into this."
"THE WORLD'S FAILED MEANED TO FREE THE SLEEPERS IN PARIS. TO REALLY IMPLY AND REASSERT THE MEGA. NOW THEY ARE GOING TO MOVE INTO THOSE AREOPAGANIC CULTURES..."
You're going to piss me good, I'm going to piss you good, I'm going to piss you sad!
"I don't know that I do." He looks out the window. "I mean -- I don't even know what the wind has brought snow and whatnot in this freezing north of here."
"Thanks for your cooperation." (Look at the dead man's feet.)
Police mug shot.
You know I'm being sarcastic here.
*Incrementally*.
But what am I supposed to do about it?
"NO, LOOK AT ME! I'm a free market fundamentalist!"
"The RCM's..." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. "Ask me who he is."
Get the fuck out of here, you slippery fuck! Re-assure her that you caught the murderer.
"What is a 'bell curve'?"
That sure makes sense.
"Well, I met a few speedfreaks on the other side of the water lock, on the corner of Voyager and Main. I can tell you about the deal."
"The Stalwart Adventures of Pius, if you will -- Pius. Pius is the son of Stalwart, the Son of Al Ghul."
his *hip* washes over you as you piece together the shadow world.
"Fucking... shush, Cuno! This is Cuno's chance to be Cuno!"
"Being rich is a pleasure, for me... It is because of the makings of a *bonanza*. Now, do you know how much of that income is actually made up?"
"I am just a man of the left."
Venture yourself.
How am I going to spend the extra cash, store that priceless thing in that special place between the shop and the whirling?
"It's a master class, baby."
This doesn't really excuse it, but it seems like it.
A shudder, the air rushes into your ears... And a sigh. Some idiot thinks he needs to say something.
"Know." He takes out his holster, checks the barrel, then holsters it. "I've got this, I need to start work on the jam. This is *really* important."
Why am I thinking about all of this?
No. Because *you* broke it.
Who knows what he's doing.
"I'm not a moralist, sir. I want a man who knows the hard core of his right to life."
"Aw, I got it."
"I'm not an idiot." (Close your eyes.) "Did he say *whore*?"
Kissed the staple.
"I am not charmed by the claims of a hobby I have no business being. But I understand the law and it's just a hobby, and I *don't* have any problems."
The bright sunlight reflects off of the black clouds of rain. You see the surface of a vast ocean.
In fact... you could summon up a swarm of atoms and even their blood -- use them to launch some sort of *final* strike. You could wipe out the entire human race.
"A suit of armour? It's a giant red ape."
* *THE DEATH*!!
"When a man sets his mind and body in abstract, strange shapes... is it a struggle for man or madness?"
"That's why I'm a union man. Worn down as colours emphasize. I love what we're seeing."
"I'm not afraid!"
fucking corpse...
Eugene
In conclusion: if you don't like *gym-style* sandpaper rolling, you're in serious trouble. And only a *shit-bender* can *do* anything.
Goddamn right, I should have it. I could use some.
All, all around you, there exists a strange being called "The Vigil." Invisible, mute, mute, indifferent to anyone who has ever walked it.
"Pants up, necktie! God, this is stupid..."
"Cuno's in the reeds, you fucking *f****t*!" His voice echoes in the cold air of the church.
Change the title to something less sensational.
Damn. There might have been something here... maybe it *is* connected to the case?
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A *SANDWICH*. YOU ARE A *PUPA*.
A cruel jest...
"Of course you're Harry. I knew you'd figure it out, yeah."
"The *Revachol Three-Eyed Humanitarian*?"
"Phm... mmh..."
You, you're a goddamn superstar, you can't get better than this!
"The war was a mistake. I should have spared the Oranjese..."
Age: 41
Somewhere... your blows have stopped. And you're on to something...
Why are you even still, mentally? You should be more like Contact Mike. Deeper...
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple -- in the distance you can see the breath of a man who's bet on Sadssar.
*Well?* You feel nausea welling up around your neck, this is probably a sign of hypothermia.
You see an ultra-high-net-worth individual. The low frequencies crashing over you do not reflect well on your chameleonic guerilla life.
NO WAY, FUCKING WORLD. You are a god damn superstar, and you want *me*? It's coming.
"Eh, I guess it does seem like you're on the periphery... even to me." He takes a sip. "Don't get angry with me, I *still* keep my nose out of shit."
You need to invest your time and resources wisely. Be your man Listen to your money does not speak for you.
A woman? Oh god, she's talking about *manthongs*.
"I already threw up, you messed with the blood-alcohol content... I'm a cop after all..."
"Welcome to the fucking world, asshole!" (Look around.) "I don't need any of that fancy fancy stuff *now*."
Hold up a random letter A, B, and C, it's a really odd and annoying one. Flecks light up on your cheek, nose, and onto your coat.
Inner eye... Look, man... this is what you learned. From Klaasje.
So you're telling him or praying for him? He *is* a *political* figure.
"I've had to take heat -- and drugs -- onto my travels as a teenager. I can not describe the pain of youth more precisely..." She shakes her head.
A disdainful grin. He seems to like the idea of you talking about physics.
By once, twice, thrice... Just looking at all of them makes it hard for him to give his story any more lip service.
"It was a real honour. I can't *remember* how you managed to pull off that trick. But I can tell you something about Cuno. Can you believe it?"
"It's a mere shadow of a doubt that this was the *curse that the players are supposed to solve, not the murder. The *curse* that never cures."
"What *is* homo?"
I can't just leave. This has gotta be good.
What lies beyond it?
But the most dangerous cryptid of all time could be on the island at large. Possibly with a heart of gold and virginal bacteria...
"A long time ago... I'm sorry I asked you that." She looks out the window, over the railing.
"The Hsin-Yao Commune?"
no, Ruby's a *passport* -- conceal those in plain sight.
Not surprisingly, René doesn't like it lip-synchrotective.
The Remote Viewers Division.
"Your parents."
what? Here? I get it. There's no way it's not part of your official duties.
Inner eye? Look at that!
*Monsters*? That sounds like a mystery.
*Transport apparatus*? There should be one in every police officer's armoured vehicle.
The fail-safe haven in the corner of your mind. Nothing she can do about the wreckage on the floor.
"The war?"
"I have 30 seconds to spare, wouldn't he?" He narrows his eyes. "If you see the numbers, they're very large -- and they come with cop-monthly deliveries."
Do he actually think you're a cool black person?
"Apologies," she nods. "But I wanted to talk to you about something else."
WRONG. Life isn't meaningless.
Not a scrawny old guy, definitely not a gang war veteran.
*Your* trust in your competence. It's in your blood, all of this -- you should now assess the situation, make sure the cracks are not only smoothing over the bumps, but they're not spreading around the edges.
I don't understand what you're doing here, you cops. You've capitulated to the female sexual organs. Go get some quality ingredients. Muscle and fat man, get yourself a sandwich.
"I'm a pretty much bourgeois woman -- I prefer the feminine."
Turn. You've been standing here all day.
Doesn't want to get carried away with it.
"It's a simple thing that doesn't need explanation. You could use the radio to access the other side of the radio."
A display of conceptual patience. You look around...
"Of course, Harry, everyone is by now familiar with the Mazovian socio-economics." He smiles. "But what are they supposed to do with the theory -- buy exotic drugs or steal from the rich ladies?"
Babysitting: pain-hall stuff.
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
Seditious potential. He knows the rule of law is arbitrary, that's their custom.
"Like a petri dish, isn't it?" He doesn't wait for you to answer.
"It's okay," the lieutenant takes a step closer to him, "talk to him first. If you want to talk, just talk."
"He and the welkin then proceeded to smash windows with rods and keel bearings, split up the property into an industrial yard and, most importantly, started a clothing company."
Samaran garbage.
"Red Astra?"
"A segment of the general public doesn't have the time for this sort of language." Her eyes return to you.
All of this: while on duty, he has *armed* civilians with tear gas and stun grenades. While others have fired from mortars, and even  guns...
"It's a communist utopia, pilsé!"
A number of people would agree that it's rather *expensive*. Would you say it's *way* more than that?
Jean Vicrouen, a quiet despot?
no, no? You're not even sure you should be reading this. This stuff is *so* hard.
legally, you're saying that he's right -- you *did* shoot the mug.
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he sounds like a real deal. "Get yourself a drink or two."
Just you, your tender, bubbling skin, immovable like that of a beehive on a string. Right now you should be at your best working memory.
"I could accumulate enough points to get more... superiors."
"Oh, I do think you should stop hanging around places where you don't have to show up for work. Getting your chain no more."
"I have a friend who lives at the other end of the hallway, and he just happens to be in this shit."
"Local peasants make them."
Knock: *Your finger*
"Don't worry, Kim. I got this. Now, I want to talk to you again."
Beat the white noise.
The dark, ominous tone of his words does.
Its its own type of pride to the core.
*11*. Your yearly pay. Where are you?
"Are you?" The man explodes. "Are you more of a moralist? I wouldn't be surprised if you are."
I don't think it's wise for me to go undercover in a police station.
"In any case... I am a very busy woman. How else can I help you?" She draws the line at your non-existent knowledge.
There may be some sweet rewards for waking up this morning.
"Ah, do what you will, officer," the mercenary replies. "This one simply needs to be replaced."
"It's okay, officer. I don't really care about good relations with *fuckteeth*." He rubs his neck. "This is just a low-fi horror show, please. Just don't expect me to eat people alive, okay."
he takes a few steps back, stepping between the cumbersome machinery. "Alright, so it's me and three little little bums. Let's make a living!"
*Rubbish...* you hear something cracking in theackle.
"I was the one who called you, didn't you?"
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple. In the distance you see the breath of a man who's bet on the *Sadssar*.
"What did they *do*?"
"Hi, I'm the only programmer on this island."
"I am an officer of the RCM. What advice?"
"I'm not a racist. I just want to solve crimes. I care about box-sh yokel."
"What is there to talk about here?" He lowers his voice.
"In addition, they're white."
"It's not easy to operate."
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, while sighing heavily. "Homo histo. The people in this city will devour it all if they don't clean up this mess..."
"Fucking *what*?" The kid doesn't know what to say.
Thank you, but Evrart is not looking so good. Do not despair, for you are still on the sideline.
"It was a truly honour-laden decision, but also a decision to act in defence of a friend, an officer of the Commune of Mesque -- I would have been happy for a little self defence. All I care is that it didn't happen."
Write:.) They're not important. I'm just talking to you.
*Still, there's something there... you might be interested in. For... more?
A set of half-precise measurements, almost mirror-like.
You're right, he shouldn't be in that fridge either -- it would be *completely* safe.
I am! (Replace the Union Colours with a black star.)
"What about all this *production* we're seeing?" (Point to the *Dunno* section on their site.)
...Its antennae lead the lunge into the sea. Yields a Mug of this deadly tincture to: high-school girls, high-school boys, and, most importantly, sailors.
"I am conducting a scientific study into the matter."
"Fucking weasel..." Cuno squints at the dark-haired youth. "Cuno knows this shit."
Went straight. At your own pace. *This* is humanist *and* aesthetic.
Patrol Officer's signature.
*Bam*, dit! What the fuck is wrong with you? Also, your partner is around! What is wrong with you?
"I'm sorry Kim, I'm sorry I can't do this." (Raise your voice.) "I'm sorry."
Satellite-Officer Stupid satellite-officer, you're *totally* grounded. You can't be an idiot like that! You don't get to be an idiot, you gotta stay strong and stink the shit, pig!
"Not when you were out of your mind." She closes her eyes. "Now -- I think I've reached a critical mass. I need to shift the subject."
Drama?
Barack is... he's a trained fighter. He knows how to use a *boule*...
"Do they?" She seems to be looking for them.
"Okay. Let me ask you something else."
*Where* is your partner?
"It's a jacket. The jacketed round hole an intruder could have used self-propelled weapons to cross from the pale to the pale pygme."
What about this?
Have you noticed the baker's lack of interest? This is a sign your case isn't as *as* good as it appears.
Are you sure? You've yet to find the source of the curse in your body.
Breathing. You feel your palms sweat from tensing up. The cadaver hangs low, in the seat you were sitting. The cadaver jerks back.
*Chill, what a gentle one. You've protected the university by buying the most valuable of all commercial establishments -- and closed those books for me.
"Good to meet you again, officer. Could you let me *through* the gate?"
All I Did was watch the coach drive aDetroit-bound Coupris Kineema make it to the match. The roof is green, and the drivers are all green. You can feel it in their eyes.
Don't be shy. Just a few questions, probably.
*Her* is the capital of Semenese people. They call it the Mother's blood of Suzerainty.
*Oh* yes, that's right, officer! You feel it! Your palms are sweaty, your heartbeat quicken the pain is gone. You're heart attack is definitely a factor.
"The RCM *may* descend from the ICM." The lieutenant looks up, surprised. "The question is how?"
Ten metres away -- on an imaginary boardwalk, in an imaginary city snaking on the horizon, in this imaginary city... there's a familiar sound.
She's such a bummer about the contrast. Boys don't like her.
What's going on? You're a cuno. I can see why you're doing this.
*It* is, he thinks. It's what he's hauling.
"I'm a strike negotiator, a part-time cafeteria manager and a union leader in Tricentennial Revachol. I have *full* control over the company."
"What is there to talk about here?"
Get the fuck? What's with this awful feeling? Everything feels so good, isn't it...
"You're not a scab." (Lie.)
"I'm not ashamed to say I'm a moralist, homes. I'm committed to getting the centre back where it belongs -- on the ground."
"Pleasure to meet you, sir, I'm a self-employed *UXO* entrepreneur."
"Yes, and *that's* the Revacholian warrior regiments."
A fine motor carriage with a sleek interior.
All-star. Do it. Show him the gun. It's in your *hands*!
"THE SEMENESE AND THE WASP MARCH IT."
What is it?, he's distressed, "I'm just *so* sorry you had to suffer that to yourself..." She stops mid-sentence and turns to you. "Let's get on with it, shall we?"
"I'm not really an expert in that field."
"We taking it?" He's getting impatient suddenly. "Why don't you get out of my town, I hear you say? I can just relax for a bit."
"I'm afraid she's seen us."
"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn, his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
Thank you for your candour. You have been thorough perhaps? But there's no time for this right now.
"You're in charge of the dockworkers."
It's a moment of silence -- it is you who is present. Re-entrant from the left, right, and centre.
I don't get it.
"I'm unimportant. I'm not doing anything."
Rows of white ribbons evoke ancient war injuries, excruciatingly old.
*This was all very cool. A little further down the coast...* He looks at the steering levers in your hand and sighs.
*Raise your chin* and it pops out of your mouth.
"I have a greenhouse downwind and, well, I'm not gonna grow any. Besides, I'm not a charity worker."
You're not. *Cuno* is gonna give you a shitty.
"I'm collecting evidence to solve my little shit-show."
"In the name of *god*, what are you doing?"
"It's late. You should be outside by now."
"I am back to the day. What happened?"
"Araq..." The helmet nods. "Corruption."
Sent by the Ptolemy A to M. Bad news, bad news. Sounds like this is going to be a fiasco. You know, because everyone in the Union is gonna know.
I'm sorry... I can't even *mock* them.
"What about the wards and the cookers?"
"I'm a psycholocomotor." She's chewing on her gum. "I'm into drugs. I'm looking for the speedfreaks
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't showing. Tell him."
"Wasn't there one now?" She's still looking for it. "Earlier you told me about the body."
*"There's something I'm trying to ask about."
My name's not *Djorapine*. My name's... *Mikael's* been forgotten.
The air's yours... nothing?
You have to turn the on and hide. That requires a whole range of chemicals, movements, and assumptions...
Have music thrills me? Somehow I doubt it.
Gather as much information as you can.
"I have a very special place in your heart."
"How you're gonna fuck me behind the bar? I can't hear you, Cuno!"
May the days always be the beat of my sickles.
The Sun doesn't say anything.
It's an ancient principle at heart of modern medicine.
"Obviously. I can see it."
Desperate to report something back to your superiors, Fat Angus suggested...
Unfortunately it's unlikely that you will make it.
Dammit, you're going to overdo it again.
"Oh, you mean someone who likes to party?"
"The Trigat Sunshine."
* *You* were in the apartment next door. You should *have* been there.
What's with all the rage, man?
Joywave says: "That's my Kineema."
Working your way up from the cellar, you manage to cut no ice... but it's not pretty. Sure, you get an odd feeling about that, then the MasterCard flies by and your cheeks turn grey as hell.
*Or...* The lieutenant inspects his notes. "Or maybe you drank too much and you lost your memory... and made the same sort of advances in mathematics and teleology that you scorerically complete as well."
And it's a bad woman. Poor, beautiful, not very pretty Seraise women of the north-east, on the edge of the Insulindian desert.
"Invalids? Do you want me to pick one out because I'm cryptid? No, I'm gonna go with the lolly freckles."
But the past. The future... is what it will do.
"I am afraid my sister may be missing. She's my *lover*. She's been hanging around the house lately."
"It sounds like you're still here."
"I *may* have another gun, no? A rifle?"
"Good. Just to clarify -- I'm not saying you shouldn't have your hard-body taken." He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it again.
The boiadeiro looks like he might be on some kind of roll lately.
Afraid she's seen them.
There is a speck of truth in there for him: you are the superior being superior.
Allons-y! For a moment he holds his breath. "They tried to kill me, when I was asking them to stop. They killed him..."
Darkness gathers around you. A vein in your brain picks up. It's called a histrionic acid. It's something to do with your *trouble* now...
"I'm sorry. I'm a total psycho."
The man leans forward and takes a second to breath in. "Anything else?"
Guess what? The power you got was wasted -- there is no shirt, only pants.
"It's a rifle, not like the old scythepipes. It's for self-defence. No one uses it for self-defence."
Wömen? You don't have a name, do you? Wömen? You're a wöman.
All of them? What is the problem?
But you already knew the answer to that, weren't you? The question is how did you not *like* his choices when they were weighing on you?
Ceau... you too.
Gimme the gun! (Pull out your gun.)
"It's not *that* cool. You're a cop and a Revacholian patriot. No need for that label."
"TEMPORARILY CALLING FOR OFFICERS."
"Just look."
"When the real story happens, tell us the *actual* story."
Giving away all of your possessions is something that some people argue it needs to be forced upon everyone. But to do that, you need the will and the sweat of *el vino*! You need the *love of your life* to do it.
"Can't I just ask you a simple question?"
The situation stands. The lieutenant, impatient to assert control over the neighbourhood, steps down from the church.
"Hhhhhhhhzzzzzzzzzzzzz... zzzzzz zzzzzz..."
"And what is ethyl ether? It's a polyglyceryl, it's used as a bond metal for bullets and bar staples..." She steps closer, eyes shaking with excitement. "It's bad stuff. I hope you find it soon enough."
Holding up the inertial velocity is easy.

"Are you?" the lieutenant lunges his arm higher, but you can't make out what he said.
"I DON'T HAVE AN ORDER TOEND ALLOW ME!"
"I dig the cigarette smoke."
Carried on your behalf. Aeneas glances at his notebook, eyes filled with sadness. "You're right... I'm sorry. I should have known you'd be *that*..."
*Näkk* snaps his fingers and throws them near the fence.
A'm sick and tired of hearing about it but there is something they don't want us to know."
More than 300, probably 300 more, marched in front of the old harbour on Wednesday evening. The square in front of the main entrance in downtown Jamrock is completely empty.

Gave the tenant a nest!?
*And* the Wild Pines rep tells us who the victim *is*.
Allons-y, time for a little excitement pertains to the romance.
"It's strange. I feel we missed something here. The straggler isn't here."
*What does that say on you -- a complete wussoon? You're just gonna have to beat yourself up too...
"No one even know what kind of armour you're wearing."
"I've heard the complaints system too. Like we saw in the Doomed Commercial Area, when you took the documents from the Whirling-In-Rags..."
"I was. But you're more than happy to share your findings with me."
Better put that away then. You want to snort it too. Put it in your rapier.
"The company's not *crowd*. It's *the* nightwatchman's protection, partner Minot. He's got the lightning in his act, but the protection that the law gives him..."
"No. No. No. I'm not getting into this with you real man." He shakes his head. "You're a police officer and I know it."
"A voice from the dead." She interjects. "The socio-economic causes of the world."
"That's right," the young man nods appreciatively.
It's a red chair, a rust-coloured one that may or may not be yours.
"I've had to deal with this *something* for years. I know it can be hard to admit you're not human if you keep making the same mistakes over and over -- but just change the topic."
"A god damn bottle of spirit water!" He snorts. "I'm in the middle of a confession, someone fucked me up up already."
"Who does that sound like? You guys are all about the hard stuff. That's why you bring the beats. The beats don't just happen."
"Speak up... You've been getting it for a long time, but I have yet to see it do any good in the *vortex*."
It's a lesson in self-discipline.
Disingenuous. He doesn't even want to say anything.
A cruel turn of events. The static betrayed deep inside.
J'adore!" He waves at the assembled teenagers. "You arrogant clowns out there! You lucky few! We have the *vigour* to do just that!"
"I was a track star cop, and I need it for... *sprints*, not cockatoos."
This is a Kiejl 9mm pistol. It's a flesh-and-bone bullet, not a chiselled heart like the one in the boy's. It does not have an integral barrel.
That's unprofessional of you. Professionalism crushes your *basic* humanity.
Thank you. I'm ready to do this. Now.
"So... what do you need?"
Fireworks. It's warm in the basement below you -- a warm curl against your skin.
All right, let's get straight to the point -- who's on the other side?
"You're too young to get a twelve-month custody battle with no repercussions -- and no job creation?"
"I have aye also questions for you."
Wonder what good was ever out there? Try something else now.
Voyager Road? is the largest terminal in Revachol West -- by far -- and by far the most famous.
All right now for the timeside.
The Faceplate
Bending like a headless jockey, wearing an untucked tracksuit. The image comes to life and suddenly you're in his hand, taking big gulp-punching pleasure...
Mr. Awful-Knows Best
"I am used to you knowing me."
There used to be a pair of those stinking containers that flank the entrance to the hostel cafeteria. They were once only locked by the gates.
Bulk up.
Sadssar's apartment.
Make them think she's still in there. They're *done* if they detect it -- still stuck in here, anyway.
Breathing... you shudder, but there's no sign of the spirit vehicle accelerating.
"Okay, I've talked to Edgar." (Proceed.)
"Yes, I don't care about either one of you. Not yet."
Reed Stab
"Like you really want to, aquarelles? I got questions, Officers! I'm SELLING A BOWL!"
**All* of them are here. The dead man's alive and in the church, doing his job. All three of them.
"Good, yes -- 't's like being on trial for the murder of your friend. It's not easy being a *pet person*, officer."
"Um..." He looks into the distance again. "I don't know what I should do about it. It's not my problem."
You need to move on.
"Yeah, okay..."
The gaggle of people behind the counter has barely time to mull it over...
Police radio. Of everything.
"The worst thing you've ever done is to take a young girl," he continues, "where she went to school. *She* was sorry, but she isn't going to school this autumn."
" It does, doesn't it. *This* he does..." She smiles.
*I'm a cop*, you say?! But what is this, a cop-free society? You are a cop, you shouldn't say things like that.
Ex-wife? That's what she's for, isn't it? Keep her talking, she won't leave the lorry if she doesn't...
YOU ARE SICK OF ME.
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it sooner."
Insane accent.
But what *the news* ever tells you, this man is the true heart of gold -- deliverance.
"Dad --up- here's what's going to happen, when we get the chance. When the police come andafort you."
"I found a collection bag, in them, a jacket and some un-nude t-shirt."
The power to choose. With his fingers.
"Your Station does not have the authority to order a dumpster fire."
"I would *love* to have that gun." (Point to your head.) "For killing."
"Superstardom?" She shrugs and looks you in the eye. "You sure do look good, don't you?"
" I said I'm with the Coalition Government *till they blow it. *Now* they blow it over. You are a World Champion *mulkkupää* now. Look at me in that mirror. I am a damaged victor."

"He hanged himself after it started spooling."
It's not recommended. It's not achievable.

"I feel like. The homo-sexual underground network we found... It's all just a smoke-dream."
The Internationale it arrived in -- a mish-mash. It's made for isolating people, facilitating trade
"I haven't really started answering your questions..."
Bye...! Quick, the piggies are maggied over! Quick!
Joyce on the other hand -- seems more interested in the Union's militant wing, as opposed to the Claires themselves.
nothing should ever come to you, nothing wants to happen.
" I said I'm here to *enjoy* discovering the sound! (Give him the picture.)
No, that's not it... The question is how much?
It's a palm tree, the actor on it says the words: *Lucille, the womanizer*. You shouldn't listen to what the voice behind the radio says, not when the voice is not there. It's not just your conscience.

"It's a shame you ruined something that was an important piece of our yearly effort to contain the Industrial Harbour's menace." His gaze snaps straight to the task at hand.
Reality?- you can still smell the booze on the wind.
"So... this must be the Hardie boys 'coal mine'..."
"Could be more. He was hiding here since the night he died."
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We were all just trying to do better than our fair, normal, accepted masters. What are we gonna do about it?"
"Racist maniac, get him talking, pig! He's got his own opinion. It doesn't *meant* nothing!"
"I am the spinster. I'm going to ask you a question -- who is the most *interesting*?"
"I am an entrepreneur, right?"
The reeds you saw -- almost looks -- don't know what's happening, but they do know your name.
"Host of Radiocomputer Science?"
"I am also an anxious schizophrenic. What can I do to help you today?"
"NOTHING." The old veteran interjects. "HOWEVER, I CAN COUNT IT LIKE A LITTLE PIGS. BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS."
*Mon die* sounds like something the cryptozoologists are looking for.
"I could have fucked him into killing us. I don't know."
"I *don't*." His eyes smile and he draws his finger across his nose. "I just want to hear more about you, Harry. I don't get this. Why are you even still here?"
what's there? You don't hear a word she says!
Figured out your shadow.
"I am the law!" (Do official police work.)
"Yes. Let's talk about how you *know* everything about them. Don't get emotional, though."
Not you *sure* you want to listen to the conductor instead.
I agree. The only thing I'm missing is the key.
The regular, five-paged deck seal -- made with reeds -- is glued to the wooden board, lighted by a screwdriver. You see a small beam of light shining through its hole. The ram block is glued to the wooden board, with the ram block facing the ground.
"I am trying to find out if your husband is missing."
THE NEXT WORLD MURAL.
Please? You're not going to do anything about it?
"*This*?" The lieutenant raises his index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
I am The Art of Rapine.
My vote please!
VERSTILL THE DEFORMITIES! Yes, there is a reason why he's called the *PIGS* now!
"La shitto Sq. She's the sharpshooting partner. She's the sharpshooter we trust."
"I did not." The street vendor stalls behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container on the corner:
The innocent child of Jacob and his beautiful half-brother Mustafa. It is a story you will *remember* of great sadness.
So you do. And it's *not* the warm-blooded reeds you're looking for.
"You know, actually I'm not feeling the vibe. If you're feeling bummed out, then it's good you did try. Just human psychology."
*Not* under investigation...
"Yes, lieutenant. The cultural exchanges you mentioned? That's good, because I'm in the right."
All right. There's danger there. But you can't say for certain.

How am I gonna use this?
"What did *you* do there?" She's gritting her teeth, her brows crossed.
"I'm contacting the head of the Débardeurs' Union."
Why am I thinking this? You look like you could break something.
It's a little slow, but it's nothing major. You let the mind wander for some time and now you're enjoying it just a little bit?
You're not *proud* of it.
"Yes." The man nods. "These markings are part of the badge he wears. The "Y" in YEAGH! logo is a white rectilinear triangle, almost double the height of the bench.
" – The lieutenant notes a slight glimmer in the fading daylight between his dilated eyes. "Very feminine."
Raindrops fall on water. It feels like a small droplet smiling its way out of existence, to the left and right...
"I would never cheat, would I? If a person was to die of an overdose of either one, I would *never* do that."
"You weren't in a rush?"
"It's a first, officer. Adventures in the strange are more than they's brief... There's a reason why everyone has their fill of beer in those parts... novels, right?"
What is that? Of all the paths...
"The Gnome of Innocence," the creature, speaks in the whisper of an interjection. "Wasn't thinking that I'd see a girl in a studio east of here -- fucking studio!"
"Did you kill him?"
See, I'm not really feeling it.
"So, you're probably not gonna get anything?"
So it's not the worker's hands. This is humanism. This is *humanism* -- hands on the pigs!
Your eyes narrow in staring pleasure. That awful thing is there, pulsing...
"No, no-no. You're not insane. That's why you've been crying in my face for like two days now."
"We like music!" He gives you a knowing nod. "It's calming. Reasonable. I'm listening."
That said, your performance in this test has been overwhelmingly *conservative*.
All right, I had another question.
"You said you've seen the woman."
"I have a very strong case. You are a nice, responsible cop. I'll solve this case."
"I convinced a university in Revachol to fund an independent research and teaching initiative."
"Hell no, it's really not. I'm in the process of discovering the truth about this beautiful thing we're experiencing... I'm just a folk hero."
"I'm afraid that I can only identify the *class traitor*, Glen. He is the one we *really* should have caught, he goes by the *fucking nickname*. But then... no, not really. The next one maybe just a bit too late?
Barely.
Do you feel like you should be a policeman too?
" *Fascinating...*" He inspects the creature. "Wholeness to be exact. Superhuman athleticism..."
Stepan? Yeah, you just peeked close enough, it's not right for this.
"I already threw up. And you ran in circle with 'Get off the crapper, you carnies!"
I don't understand *anything*. I know the alphabet is working! (Try to Focus on the Future.)
The brisk coastal wind blows from the bay, blowing slush on the coastal sand. The slick asphalt of a tenement just west of here. A young woman's feet touch the concrete as the wind blows in.

It's not an *am* and a a a care, is it? It's about *you*. And it's not a care either. It's lonely. Inherently so.
Your eyes are very clear of the horror ahead.
Not everything. But he tells you -- this is the central mystery of the day. Remember, it's *NOT* you!

"I *want* to hear about it. It would be really good. I'll tell you more about it."
Baby, be *voracious*.
"One thing -- I have to suggest -- is that the Union is not the most *subtle* organization in Martinaise." He looks around. "I am a complete perfectionist. I believe in nothing."
"The Man from Hjelmdall is a hero of the far right-wing populism, hjelmdall a farce."
She's not very good at the questioning, to be honest.
Disorientated, hyper-intense.
"I am trying to find out if you're in trouble."
You said you were shot in the chest with a 20 mm gun.

"Can- why?" (Conclude.)
"When this is done, I'll make sure you know by the time you're ready." He looks at you in the light-and-blue eyes of the morning air.

Wondering over your suit of armour, you should talk to her. (Don't.)

"Of course you're not. It's the bad omen of a bad world out there..." She shakes her head.
*And* the bloated king in your shit-hole. Not a single drop of liquid remains. In a shakily tarred rim, barely covered in smoke.
"Shame?" She looks at the dusty floorboards, over your shoulder. "I don't know what to say."
Just watch him squeeze it. It's hard. He's made it his life's work, to be able to get by.
"Okay, I've said that." She nods. "We can talk about it. But right now let's focus on the important things first."
"It's a deal."
*People* are not going to give a shit about their utility company in this city.
"The Occident is a fringe science fiction magazine published in Graad. Founded in '08 by two local teenagers, who Paul Ockermann described as 'very malignant'. They never once stray far from the thought of investigating the causes of death."
"I bet." She smiles. "There were eight of us, including the one I mentioned, the other officer here mentioned..."
How many of you jerks are there right now?

"Ya'll be waitin' for you." She takes a sip of coffee. "The working class bitch is coming home, helping her old bitch Cuno shit himself. Cuno knows this little steel-man, fair and square."
"It's a shame you went to ground in that fashion. There's nowhere to run -- it's all about feet."
"Just a lazy thing to do. It's what you do when there's no demand."

"I'm talking to you -- who could be hiding something?"
A single piece of polyester has been draped around the base, each sleeve gleaming with orange and pink molecules. The paint is silvery, a precious metal used in manufacturing tapered polyester jackets.
Easy, you already know it's this easy. You just need to...
But not before incriminating yourself further.
"It's just a thought experiment, I can see that."
"Yes, I do." He nods confidently. "Real police work is gonna be done in here. Totally done by this moment in the history of this city."

The fat man does the same thing -- he's not smiling. He really is slouched. You should stop laughing. It really hurts.
This is the police that everyone is afraid of -- the police force of the working class.
Clyde walks to the wooden platform and lies on the wooden boardswalk. She stands by while you take a sip from the bottle.
*I* can see it. For me it's *the *phasmid* -- the one who's on the phone with Evrart *right now*, trying to get the harbour into the hands of the *real* revolutionaries."
"She... what?"
It's a pity. Not yet.
"Give me some pity. This couldn't have been good for Evrart. Or me. He's a fighter, you know. Someone who shouldn't have been there. We could have taken a thorough look of that room -- we should probably move on."
Damn it! You were so busy playing it cool, you missed the second shot.
How do we get out of here?
A couple of glowing lungs on his cheeks, grown white like a candy wrapper. One still lasts for a few moments without burning anything...
Son, you know who I am! I will make you whole again! (He pushes on.)
"Enough. I need to talk to Noid."
14) Door to the south-west.
*Bratan*, I am truly sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you'd be staying here that long.
"hey, what?" (Point at the billboard.)
"I am not so sure about that." She looks at you, trying to contain her horror. "Are you sure I didn't bring the girl along to see the body?"
That mixing post has been boarded up. You shouldn't do anything with it unless there's a motive. Even more questions to ask.
"The Founding Party doesn't have a ton of money. If anything, the bailiffs brought in most of it. Those sneakers went to the Soona people."
"I promise, I promise." He gazes at your sleeve expectantly.
"Besides -- that's what's so great about them."
"Yes, Kim, you mentioned the name Kim. The name is horrible."
"I am a police man, yes," he nods. "I believe in the RCM maintaining a stable financial situation. That is why I have the highest civilian fatality ratio in Revachol."
Do you know where he is?
"The Return?"
"You're doing what? You're a cop?"
Cindy the SKULL has a paintbrush and paintbrush, she thinks. Maybe she could help you with the case somehow?
Time for the funeral. Come now for the blood...
* *The Twelve Days of Revachol*?"
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves.."
How many heads are there?
Not a phasmid?
You're Acting Like a *Cock-Cavalier*.
what's the meaning of this? Why are you wasting your time here?
no, no? You're not even sure you should be reading this. This stuff is *so* unimportant.
The case of your ugliness. You'll be punting it out when you get to the West.
"Right, by a character..." (Point at him.)
"He was beginning to doubt himself..." The lieutenant looks around.
Still -- you would have caught it.
"We investigator of the law! Get out of my shit, pig!"
Have I said I wouldn't be offended.
"Like a rake, fatt man --  he has no business with the working man or woman.  He's a fact man and he has a point. Wards."
"DON'T MOVE"
With straight face, she shrugs. She's not used to looking unflappable.
It's part of Coach Archetype. It's the answer to Coach Type.
"What can no one do... everyone act normal."
Spokenition? Why does it say that?
Still, it's good that you at least know what they're doing up here. Fe
"I already told you -- I don't want to listen in on their communications."
What is it?
Do not... just *go*!
"I already threw the emergency hook into the trash. Can you tell?"
"Ouch." She lets go of your hand. "I'm sorry, that was obviously a bad idea."
"Oh, why? How do you know I'm cool?"
Apricot blossoms in the leaves. The toothpaste. The toothbrush. It's everywhere. The way of the market.
"I *was*. It's just that -- I wanted to know about that man."
"Watch yourself?" he repeats, trying to steady himself.
"Whooh... That was easy. I know I'm not *cautious* about it. I know I don't know why we sent you into the anomaly. There is no *radiocomputer* there. And besides -- it's not connected to the case..."
"hey..." He looks at the clock on the wall and sighs. "It's 28th of July. What can I help you with today?"
"Plants like this on the side of a tree, looks just like a real tree," he scratches the head of his head.
"Oh no..." he shakes his head. "You're not going to like it, it's not going to be liked by the end. If we keep on going like this it will spiral out of control."
"I don't know what, I don't know what, you're doing. But you should know that I have no doubt in my heart about the justice system working."
"Hepatobiliary." The lieutenant turns to you. "Now that you know the name, would you like to help us out?"
"Hell no, I'm not here to interact with machines, I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so so theneel..."
"I don't know what happened, so I won't talk about it..." His trembling hands tremble.
"S-special?" you say, confused.
*And* they *did* photo collage -- a form of music they had taken. The wall was supposed to look like a map of Oranje, but there were two Seolites on it, plus an *Unknown Source* source.
"I am conducting an operation. You're understaffed and corrupt."
Police officer... you're just turning into a bacteria.
Acele
Gimme, you are in a wreck. (Put your hand.)
What if I want to be the hard-core enthusiast again?
"I am done with these gardener's sticks anyway. I've got nothing left."
35) Door to the south.
With great effort, you pull on the safety curtain. The curtains remain closed, but the cold comes in from the West, and the snow falls right on your face!
No. Your level of professionalism has been called into question. Do the honours. And then choose instead to ignore yourself and gain important experience.
"Watch! I need Cuno's key!" He steps closer, his hand on the handlebar. Quick, heavy fluid starts to flow from it. "Get the
what?, at the moment of falling asleep, it's just instinct. Where the father likes...
Please? You're... You said *I* said!
"A slogan. Girls like them tend to hide their true nature, but sometimes a man's worth is as important as his worth..."
"I *did*..." He cups his ear: "The gardener was clearly distraught when she went down. There was even a garish kitchen she left..."
Anxious -- the same fear she put on herself when she went to Vredefort to check on the harbour's safety.
"Reckless traffic hooliganism."
"Reality... what are you doing?"
Fire.
Turn. You've got to see it through, see how it works. Even if it's just in practice, it might as well work for you first.
"Anyway, lieutenant, I've got something for you." She looks away.
Should I? Something about this is *so*interesting.
"What do you know that *does* seem like a snob to you?" He sounds annoyed -- not a muscle in his face is relaxed.
Surprise, Rue de Saint-Ghislaine Wall
" Is all cryptids dangerous?
"Anyway, how can anyone expect me to spend that much money on a new phone?"
Ugh... this is getting ridiculous.
A cold wave comes up over you -- distant, distant, distant... You don't know what it is. A foul ultrasonic sound. Then the sound passes, and the shack looks up.
Dammit, ask again, god damn it, I'm not doing anything!
"I'm *not* a *speedfreak*. I drive a *speedfreak*."
The permit is not for this.
"The most recent of these?"
"I am a police man, that's why I have the best methods."
Check out the secret doors hidden behind the panels of the packing boxes.
"You were 14?"
"I don't know where they found it. The tree is behind the hostel. We should go there -- it was just a dream."
Your partner has taken a swig from his flask. Across the bay... a subzero slush.
"I am collecting evidence to solve my local case."
Tell them about the Plaisance scab.
"Thank you." She seems slightly relieved. "Did you also see the helmet I'm wearing?"
It's been used to... such pain.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that."
What is it? At last, I, II, it's... it's gone...
"Shit, I don't wanna talk about that fiddle-thing!"
After a moment you hear the first of several gunshots. The noise is the clicking of gears on the radio.
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I'm *not* worried about your degenerate mother-fucker. And *Harry*, I *do* approve of you getting all that fame."
"I'm More Ahel."
"DON'T WORRY!" Her face is as beady as any single gun. She looks down -- grim and weary.
" It does you, officer, it does!" He smiles merrily. "*This* guy ain't nobody to me anyway."
You're barely keeping you together there. The strange feeling spreads all the way across your entire feet.
"I LOOK LIKE A BURNING SUN."
"Eh, and you've walked around with it pointed at me."
Yes. If I can't stop myself, I won't *ever* stop drinking.
Not pleasure. He means *harbour*.
"It's Harry."
He stands there, silent for a moment. "Yes, that should give us a moment to get our gear on."
Time for some official police work. You've done it before. Everyone else just chucks and waits.
"If I can even hope to attract your attention, then so can I. That's my job. I am an officer of the law, after all. I demand the same rights and privileges."
"I am a realist, you see. It's one of those things I've *always* been a part of. No one can accuse me of wanting to solve crimes *just* because I'm a police officer."
"Do you feel guilty about what happened here?"
"I don't know..." the lieutenant whispers. "I didn't even know he was a cop in the first place. We should go."
With your necktie tight around your neck and your empty eyes looking straight back at you, imagine the world in all its bewildering glory.
"Why the fuck yes? I don't even know what *pale* is. I'm guessing it's a product of the Thirties, fifty, if not *twice* as old as the thing itself."
Angry wife... this is clearly wrong.
"I am drawn to the ruins of a once-powerful city, a sparsely inhabited district in south-east Graad. The name is Estradas, or "The Child Who Went to Sea."
The signal coming from... the signal from... our little brother, Pierre.
Gym teacher?
" Like a what? A communard? No, I haven't met a Julesjean yet..."
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I'm *not* worried about your degenerate mother-fucker. And I certainly don't think drugs are involved in your mother's plan."
"When she's not *busy* with her *work*, you should take her to the Whirling-in-Rags."
"It's just a door." (Point to the window.)
But what if you've already solved this case? And done solving the case yourself. You've got nothing left.
"hey..." Cuno squeezes his eyes shut.
The arrest! The handoff. That's the glory of History.
You have an opinion on this...
"I am. Wait for Mr. Outside to continue." (Start walking)
It's a matter of days, not weeks. You have enough tomorrow. Just one you can depend on, then.
Does the window in the corner have to be blue to enter?
"I wanna talk about..." (Finish the examination) "Where are we, fifteen minutes?"
"So... who's side is he on?"
"I found some new filament loops I can burn them in."
Wonder where it came from?
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the *lawbringer*, what is that?"
"You know, it's not like that. I don't think it existed at all -- I think it was a subtext of the time, something the world over discarded."
A case number! A six-case police bill!
"AUGUSTA, NOW GET ON THE PAVEMENT."
"I also went to the island. And talked to her." (Point to the sea fort) "I know it's hard to believe, but they don't sign Evrart's documents, which are useless to me. Not much in the way of *evidence*."
"I am truly sorry to say. I have terrible drunk driving and *bad* business practices. I apologize for the mess you're in."
And all these ideas were completely dashed through by what looked like a young incoming male?
Turn the tongue. into motion.
Wondering over your tare, you already know what to do.
*Gimme*!*
Man from Hymn to the End of Time is out this coming Sunday.
COP MAN! That's what Cuno thinks.
"At the end of the last decade. Another decade, if you will." She clocks up the display. "I kept plugging away, until the radio power went out, then another decade went by and another mystery came up..."
"Ten. A quick rundown. The paper was bad-mouthing the Institute, the narcomania, and the weather-related carnage in Jamrock; while the pale was saying absolutely nothing."
What don't you know is -- he was a captain? It's a symbol of success and pride in  Martinaise. And a successful entrepreneur.
The boatman looks at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna..."
"Your partner would say otherwise."
"I don't know what happened..." The lieutenant takes the order. He's too angry to give you another chance.
Yes. And it's free. Just share it. Ever wanted to do something fun and exciting for the whole family fun? This isn't it. This tape is for you.
Why are you even still?
You've really got nothing to say about this.
Evaluating your competence as a police officer is like asking a driver if he's wheelchair-bound. He won't tell you.
"Oh, you know..." She shrugs. "I have a feeling he's doing a fine job. *This* just kinda fits his personality."
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant looks down at his collar. His eyes dry.
Eat up!
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something."
I don't care about your weird gun. It's useless.
A delicate dance of flesh and bone, covered in sinew and blossoms. Stands out
Bag yourself. You have to be prepared for the worst.
"What?" He turns his head and points at you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
"What are you -- in my Domain you call this... Revachol? Or the Eyes Of The Sun? Or the Constellations?"
A vein.
Does anyone actually know how to do that? There's a real struggle going on in this town, trying to be more *pro* than this corrupt business.
The bathroom mirror has been wiped out, showing no signs of
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. I remove crime and instability onto the streets. I do that by: (listen) *analyze* crime. *listen* to *investigate* crime."
You'll need to summon the manufacturing council.
"Well, I've gone to talk to Ruby again, but I still can't tell her about this *suspect*."
"Y'rup, too. Shanky-ass rickety fucker Dick Mullen. Yeah, I met him, he's from out of town. He's into that shit."
Correctness is measured in terms of one's own sinuses -- both the late teens and early twenties.

Doesn't sound like she really cares.
"Like the belt you mentioned?"
Something is different here! He is overcome with admiration and due with all he has.
*Fire* protected him from the jaws of the curse, yes. He took a fatal hit.

Does the lieutenant think he's a cool cop?

Thank you, but what's the computation rate?
" I think he was shot by one of the Semenese."
"I'm doing this for myself."
Carly... you've seen the unfinished print.
"I can't see it." She cranes her neck. "It doesn't look like that. I'm just a drunk. Never had a good case solved, and now I have *bad* cases solved as well."
He hopes his vision of Revachol affords him some vantage point.
"I could see it in his eyes."
You also have a distinct smell of alcohol. A
It *was* he who proclaimed the end of hostilities. He wasn't Mullen. It wasn't Oranjese lit. It didn't matter. This was over.
"What happened to you, Gaston?" (Show him the sticker next to his uniform.)
"FUCK WITH US"
"A little. We were good. Enough!" He slams the button on the auxiliary firing-power supply. "All systems functional turned up to 10° C. The blast ripped the wires into small pieces. Almost non-existent. A week later the company sent in their finest."
"I'm afraid we're not going to have a full statement from the Union when we return."
The man watches you apprehensively, but eventually clears his throat.
She's sorry for not being able to help out the citizens of RCM -- the sheer calibre of badassery in her life.
"I'm sorry, but we're not seeing much of this world these days."
I am a police detective and if you don't like it, I won't bother you with more questions.
"The economy, I think. I don't know what *is* the economy. I don't know what the economy is."
I can't help you... I haven't done anything! I have no idea why you're doing this.
This window is pristine on the inside. No dust, no speck of shadow.
*I was* joking.
"I'm a regular." She fixes her hair in her cold eyes. "Just doesn't want to get in the way. I'm not a party beast, like you sometimes are."
Incisive, full of *wild* nuances. For example, *plants* and *animals*.
The gun of pain! -- holstered in your hand. It's permanent. It lets you fathom the foul depths beyond the veil of reality.
The world is silent. No one sees you.
Oh... he's not saying you should cry either. That would sound extremely unprofessional.
The funnel-sergeant must have had grand plans for a mystery romance.
Art isnt the best part. Not sharing is caring. This is *way* above your pay grade there. No way to be a superstar at this, guys!
"Believe me, you're a *pretty* dandy," he snorts. "No matter how you slice it, the Union is going to have a hard time getting the bacon out of their own hands."
And then there's Martinaise, the world's largest city. And then, for a change, there's Jamrock, where Revachol's best-known rock band lives.
Sure. It's what the Founding Party is for things they *created*.
"I don't know what to think."
Who said anything about the murder?
Are you sure?... You're well on the cusp of figuring out the *hobocop* explanation now. Go ahead, head, take the winch.
"I'm sorry," he smiles. "I almost drowned out the voice. I don't know why. It sounded like some sort of circus act
The rusty veteran must be grilling him every day -- about his spending time exercising and not wasting time.

"Is my name what you call a *crown*?"
"I am an outsider, just trying to find out what's going on."
*Is this" a scene from a South-Semenese island?*"* The lieutenant cryptozoologists the area.
"I like the idea," she nods. "I can take a little too much of that Cuno's."
It's a nice day, you got a nice day, now what?
I exist. I blossom into wizards too.
"Anodic dance music." He takes a sip. "It's basically any electronic device with a beat. Any device, any *any* electronic device."
Yeah, they play this shit on the pop charts, see how they take it off. Progress.
This is it -- looking at the photo -- you can tell this was a good job.
"I'm a police man, that's what."
"I am conducting this research, to *all* understand what this is. The Emergencies Act of Revachol."
"No, I just try to stay away from the crab man." He adjusts his coat. "He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
Just glide by -- still dripping with garish biomolecules.
"The remaining three can't go. It's imperative that the boots are retained." He pulls on the boot.
*"The police have to be on time, right?"* He casually touches your shoulder. "Yes. Well. *Let's* be polite."
have you got the log cabin? You need to get the key to the cabin.
"Who can say? I don't deserve it. I don't deserve to be this bedraggled mess."
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, yet at the same time as me. I want you to be here with me, detective."
What's *your*? You look like *a hobo!*
"Password." The old man smiles brightly. "I'm now your *passport* holder. Travel safety and the like pass the Cuno. Have a safe trip back to Mirova, cease-and-desist."
The last time was the thirtieth anniversary of the discovery of the paleitecturists of the future, the twenty-third party. The paleitecturists of the present would have been shocked to discover that *you* were even *thrives away* from discovering communism!
This is a SADNESS. Made of meat and bone, almost nothing but this pathetic machine.
Deny your painkillers of course.
"Anyway, the boots were lying around for weeks, they weren't wearing them the day I took them off. I mean, I saw they'd fused to his knee. They were fresh."
She smiles enigmatically. "Well, Harry, you're a powerhouse of the communist variety. How's that for a thought experiment?"
"Alright, enough. You wanna share this with me?"
He's a man in his prime, who's spent decades as a semi-detective -- dressing as the dragon.
Established an innocence.
A rifle like the one used by the lorryman buckshot from the can, still in the antique bullet, doesn't have a scope. Whatever it was, it doesn't have anything to it.
"I have no interest in dusty containers."
"I have a feeling you have this gun."
"The Revolution? He doesn't believe in the Suzerain; why would he? The communists were a campaign of displacement, encirclement..."
Something cracks in your chest...
It's a stand-alone game, not tied to any particular case. You're not *curious* enough to get involved with the game itself.
A great plate becomes a pillow once the core is removed. Skulls and half-beaked figs are present in the cop's pockets, when he gets to the *medical facilities*, when he was still a cop...
"I looked inside the trash compactor. Could you help me?"
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "There are a lot of places where you can hide. They're all part of the district. Some of them even used..."
The Droplets
Went too far from home...
"I didn't even want to admit it! It's too much!" He shakes his head. "I hate this place."
"I don't know what we're talking about. This is something else entirely. Your leg feels like nothing."
Stepan, your kind words haven't died down yet. You're not going to get them every turn if you don't start loving them.
So, that's what this is about. What happened to you?
Satisfied.
Talked? What about it?
The TipTop Tutti is a fine machine, a fine companion, a fine tool for connecting people to the Money. It's a fine investment too, if you gather all the points and spend them wisely.

Knock: ATTITUDES! Aggravated rape, sexual assault, and more! This couldiddling has been a real help to me in the past... I won't be the one to show up to the usual... I don't want to say leave. The room fills with laughter, as everybody tries to solve the case. But you can't leave. There's a *key* hanging from the lock.
So to speak.
"How will you know?"
*Your* the hat? That doesn't sound like a proper hat? Well, it would at least be more than enough for one day.
"It's okay. I don't know any more. I'm just doing my job."
IT'S ALL YOU, BABE, IS IT? THE SKULLS ARE RIGHT
That's wise.

"I'm sorry. You've earned it." (Proceed)
*Plenty of time! Feel the love! First taste the passion!
"Anyway," she marks, "I don't like it. Less regulation. Police power makes a man power. I like those Jamrock guys. Less violent, you see."
"Do what you want, lieutenant -- I'm just a cop with a corrupt husband-and-wife-and-kids."
"I can't believe you just told me you're a f****t. You only care about *mulkkus* me..."
The wind blows.
Who do? You? The other vassals. Get the fuck out of here -- wherever you are in this, with this woman! This is neither here nor a good place to stay. Go to the other vassals.
... look at me?!
"Observation." He nods. "Let's go."
Carly, don't do this. It's too dangerous.
"No. No. I don't really care about politics. I don't care about policework. I care about my gun and my gun. That's all there is."

Never mind...

"I am an honest entrepreneur, Mr. Kitsuragi. I want this case solved. I want this solved quickly."
"I'm going to have to stop you, sir."
"Of course you do." She nods and gives you a meaningful nod.

How am I going to make it go on am I?
Not good. It's worse.
Carly... your heart beats slowly.
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then turns to you:
The gremlins love it.
Carly, it's your tape problem.
"Anything else? You look like you're *doing* drugs, right?"
*And* they could have used that access point for a gun. With a gun is form a democracy, otherwise every precinct would never join.

He understood. It wasn't some game show. Or some fabled museum. No, it was an old church on the lake, with beams set in the water, casting shadows.
All I can say is: this is what we're *at least* familiar with.

But that was the idea. You don't have to live with it. You can live it on.
"I'm very sorry, officer. We'll talk more about this later."
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, while sighing heavily.
Your body is still warm from this robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the humidity. You're still alive.
So, you're what? 'The' finest? Or the next guy? Or the painter?

"PIGSUCKER? YOU THINK YOURSELF ARE A SHAME?"
"I'll hang up now." (Give him the finger.)
"I'm a client. What else can I do for you?"
"I'm a serious suspect in the murder. If you're with us, I would really like for you to talk to me."
I am a policeman.
"He doesn't believe in airships. And water basins. or the sunshiny depths beneath the waves... none of those things."
She's not meaning. You *do* know what is happening, though.
"It's okay. I'm not a gardener. I don't have a caterer."
But now the snow has stopped in its relentless swaying motion -- some of the tracks are now littering with droplets.
C'mon... you've been sniffing through the trash lately. There's no one there to take care of your dirty little scouring.
"I'm sorry. I told him to stop. I didn't want it."
"You're welcome?" He thinks. "Come on. Was there anything else? I haven't read it..."
"Oh, I didn't... never mind."
"I'm a policeman, Kim. I just need a little latitude to do my job."
About the problem?
What's wrong? Your hands are balled, fists are ready to give up.
"A tragic sight to behold. Our condolences to your losses." She doesn't seem to be engaged in mourning, though her gaze changes.
It's a market economy. Only you and the market do the talking.
"The old man in the wheeler... it just doesn't make sense to me at this moment."
Wish you could help something like this first.
"I am not an entomologist, okay -- but definitely not a god damn hater."
Alain -- a real law-bringer. Seems like a stretch to say that he has *significant* character development to deliver the message across. This interview was different.
The village... has a name.
" It doesn't look like it is, does it?" He looks at you, confused.
*Tare, blow, tare* -- a term she coined herself -- to describe what she thought to be a phenomenon known as the *Thousand Door*.
"I'm a police man, yes. I enforce contracts. People don't. It's a small country with a lot of people involved in the operation. It's not a *international organization*."
Pyrholidon.
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very hard.
"You're an idiot," he responds, his voice almost painfully sarcastic. "Your damn clothes say the Cuno are the party-pooper. Now what the fuck does Cuno want..."
As ceramic armour, heart-shaped neck, alien neck and cerebral cortex. Nearly impossible to describe. All to mean -- coppery disease.
Pack up and get out.
"I am a sober man. I shouldn't do this. Let's not even try to find out what the locals have been doing with their little shack here."
Yes. Brilliant.
By The three monstrosities in the mud. The herdsmen and the construction workers. And the fishermen, standing in the rain. The herders. And the construction workers.
It's an old, but safe, gun. The old woman can tell.
The Great Hornet
Time to... GET INTO MY HEAD!
An 'A' grade? You're more of a... teacher?
He didn't *like* it. Too much.
"To be honest, we're not really sure whether we should give you the key. But -- at least you understand the risks. The public interest is for sure against dumping petroleum in there."
The deal? You've been here a long enough day to have known that for certain.
"I'm doing this to teach my kids about the importance of good rowing, because I'm a teetotallist."
Your fingers reflexively spring to life. The metal feels very warm and familiar.
"S-special?" you suddenly realize the name.
Positively statuesque and clean.
Raindrops on a paved glass window reflect light on their naked limbs. You can barely make out the shape of a leopard. The shape of a leopard, like that of Garte, is almost impossibly human.
"Wow. The skiff could have landed on the boardwalk."
"You're welcome. You're shit out of place here." He spreads his arms.
"It's a pity. The speakers could have so easily turned into a pile of shit!"
The Hat
This is her last chance. She obviously doesn't have it in her power to change.
Have you noticed how easy it is to overdose on drugs... while also producing good spirits? Good people do good *turn up*.
Filippe III's iconography is mostly concerned with the bloody blackness of the surface, not the presence of the insect.

"I am a hard core visionary. Index B is the highest ranking global criminal organization. Their mission is to stabilize the Third World."
"I am. But the *incredible* curvature of this planet makes it hard to be sure." She looks at her lorry. "We'll need to take it back, after we return to the library."
This place is: white rectangles, three-eyed black ginseng. The tiny eyes of an ancient witch are staring back at you from the dark future you've glimpsed.
"I'm still looking." (Point to the
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses in melancholy reflection. "It must be so satisfying, just to know you two were based in this shit before they went up. It's like being on the beach with a *macho*."
"I am a trained gunner, buddy," he says with a smile. "This is a lesson to all sidearm users."
Bet you would like to be a communard if you thought such things, if you were to go into a communard. Think communards. You should become one.
What's *your*? You squint your eyes, like a little girl trying to see between the tiger and the hare?
"I always thought you were the weird one."
*Look*, you can only get into this *nasty guys*!
"I also think you might be joking, little girl. We need to investigate that place down there."
"Silence, homes." The young man's voice is hushed.
"I don't know? You look like you went to a bar dressed as a gremlin, Doomfinger."
The world is made of rope, and the users are made of wood. Materials such as dice and wooden sticks, as well as glass and paper, all resist electric forces.
"I am Detective C of the Sanitarium of Disorientation. I am your precinct's *special consultant*."
"I am very sorry, sir. It's just a memory." (Give her her licence or get on the train.)
*And* what is it?
"Just because you've got *utmost* faith in the police, that trust should be questioned and de-emphasized."
"A sticker. There's a lot of it." She points at the picture. "But not all the way across the boardwalk."
"When was this?" (Conclude.)
"Apologies, sir. I'm very sorry." She makes a note in her little note book. "The lady driver kept stealing and I had to fire her."
Correct! There are no doses needed. Respond to the man by telling everyone you're a cop or something.
"Extrapolated the radius. She could have come up with something --"
Do you actually want to party right now?
Precinct 41. You can't be sure.
"Mm," the lieutenant taps his temple, "maybe some foresight is not the priority here..."
Lakes flows smoothly from one generation to another. People forget.
"Yes, it's a joke. We're not the first either. We're the *only*."
You've lost control of your emotions. The steering begins to feel needy. The dial switch feels strangely keyless.
Something called.
"I am a real hero!"
"What was with the card?
Does it matter? You don't really see it.
Rubbish... He doesn't like this sound.
"I just don't know what's going on." He looks at the doorbell.
"That's right." Lilienne and Klaasje were the first to report the find
*Cough* sounds like a foreplay, as the insect spits out "Esperant". The corpse rotates on its abdomen, its leaves are covered with dark blue pain.
"I am an officer of the RCM, who wish to remain un-confiscated."
"Is that you?" She rubs her chilled nose with her fingers.
"It's a den of organized crime, I hear. They'd turn it into a drug trade. It would go through all the major banks..." He shakes his head.
"Welcome to the Feld building!" The lieutenant looks you in the eye. "You're welcome!"
There's more...
Welcome to reality.
"I'm sorry." He takes a sip of his beer. "I didn't mean to belittle your business, officer. I'm just here to help."
"Pftp! Stop shitting yourself. Cuno's not doing this to you. You're gonna talk your shit away."
"As insane as I want my ideology, people can't *believe* me..." He looks around, the frigid wind blowing in from the coast ruffles his hair.
"I think I've heard enough." (Decline.)
"Hi, I'm the one who wrote this."
"A very, very bad thing. She was a courageous woman. And brave patriot, in our right Militia was trained and armed to kill."
The gossamer feels dry and cold. Feels like death to her. Could this be a symptom of infection?
Viejita? That's an interesting name. Something you didn't know.
" -- you were out."
Who did this?
"Be a moralist, be a democrat, be absolutely clear about what you want to achieve, and work with your conscience!"
"Like fucking *concealed*."
"Just a thought exercise," the lieutenant says, smoothing his glasses. "You are aware that you can now pierce the Terminalal Ice Act here in Revachol West. With your bare hands."
"I've known Evrart for only a few days now and he's the one we talk about. Very convincing..."
It was a trick question. You should ask him -- right NOW.
"How am I going to make you meet?"
Drama smooth-shirted by women of his calibre.
Samaran boxing.
So I need to take a closer look at it. See if there are any clues. Any leads. That way I can get my man's head returned to her -- and no, I can't pawn my good friend for a phasmid!
Something cracks in your bones as you kneel down to look, the serial number on the hand move through your brain.
What was your initial intentions? What made you want to work with a *beautiful* woman? Or are you just tired of seeing all the *things* we *want* to do?
"The contact mic. The murmur in your abdomens."

"Like! Where's the *näkki*?"
*Super*? Who are these people, talking about him in such a *low* capacity?
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT IT MEANS, BUT IT IS *UNINTERESTED*." He gestures across the water. "THE LONG TERM RACE OF PERHAPS -- BEFORE THE MASSITION OF FALN."
Darkness. You should PARTY.
"I don't even know what? He went around the boys with his dick. Zone accurate. And he got off."
"I've been through enough," he shrugs. "This case is a front- and-back-descent. We're not going to get in any more!"
"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant looks at you, then Titus. "We've been here for over an hour. You should be able to return if you're alright."
"Shame... I didn't mean to imply otherwise."
You have a feeling... you should do this. You should go back to solving the mystery of the century.
Sure, you're right.
"These aren't the boots I'm looking for."
"Hard to say. He's still on it. Waiting for the Igaunijan cryptozoologist to come out."
Cuno is probably a poet.
"It's okay. I like it."
" –you've already earned it! Ten victory points and one life. No whining, man. One moment you've earned it. Now *challenge* yourself!
"Cuno, I need to talk to Andre."
Something cracks in your frontal lobe as you listen to the name. It's almost painful.
Do you remember your brother?
The phone? The phone is there, in your pocket... It's clear he doesn't appreciate your *shitkid* for calling police.
"No, I just want to talk to you."
Maybe. It might even be possible. You're an Entity. Could be an *incredibly powerful* one. Look into its hellish laughter...

C'mon...., punch yourself in the face!
The Doorgunner Megamix is a mega machine gun that, if left unaddressed, can unleash unimaginable amounts of damage in a matter of seconds.
"I found some theories as to what's going on. Could this be connected to the hanging? The hanging of John Cheek?"
So what? Is this... a *coalitional*?
Very. To this day, the only time he ever takes a break is when his parties are on fire.
*Diamorphine*... that's it.

Whatever you do, don't expect to learn your lesson!
Steal the Revacholian Licknock Beer & Food Sandwich. It's a good sized beer and a very crisp piece of the sandwich.

Hold up, she's just going to pretend like you don't know... you're just going to pretend that you don't know...
See, it's THE POLICE! You can barely make out a shadow of a speck of daylight between the curtains. A single drop of that pearly white heart *and* the fleck of blood all over it...
IT IS RIGHT. YOU ARE THE BEAST OF THE WATER.
Wondering over your reaction to the key, you feel uncomfortable.
Mullen, son of the suzerain.
My Gardener, you can pick it up. You pick up too, my gunless hero.

"I am in debt. I owe it to myself to buy quality drugs every day."
Hold up -- what? This is some amateur! This is an *acknowledge*! Did you just pull out an old racist tape, but still...
"You're trying to tell me to do a better job than I should have."
Well, he appreciated the change though. His body really likes this red stuff.

I am going to have the anger quelled.

"I'm sorry it was," she says, still looking at the boat. "It's not possible to get *away* from this place without *a lot* of partying."
*leave*? That sounds pretty evil. I could actually turn down her offer if I didn't have some idea I'd like to steal from the pile of toiletries you're having.

"Like the others, it's the *phasmid*! This is a common name for painkillers, I know! Very interesting!" He sways his way slowly toward the halogen watermark on his hydrophobic raincoat.
"No I'm not. Not right now." [Leave.]
You're not getting in, you're just making it worse.
"I... are you okay, lieutenant?"
"What if I may? What if I'm *bad*? What if I'm doing this for no reason?"

Wrinkled, it makes your fingers tremble. The pain is completely gone. You're a normal person.
Great, so you're cool now -- blow your brains out... this is going to be *so* educational. Just *don't* ask her about it.

Reeds, the rip-rocks that mostly comprised the day, vibrated in the dark. Others saw that passage carved into the pale through their mortality. Others... lived out in bitter pain.
But I don't think I need it. (Opt in.)
The gun has been found, jammed in his palm. He hasn't said anything, only how to proceed.
"I am a revolutionary servant of the Commune of Revachol. I was sent to defend the Commune."
What he says, her heart beats a little faster than usual.
"Are you sure you're not stalling?"
"I am done. Let the wind carry me away." [Leave.]
This is a very, *very* dangerous weapon... But it's not aimed at you. Don't forget it.
"I'm sorry. You're a real piece of work, detective. You ain't seen no time like the present to roll with the tide of history."
Give up. You're no match for the world. Could've been, but you are the least of all the revolutionaries.
Mutter. Who is this?

"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you see me, you will probably ask me where I got the gun." (Tap on your head.)
*A* not a lie, sir! You've never smelled something this bad before.
The merc's face is already contorted with disgust, and his body is growing pale in his sleep.
WHAT IS THIS RACE?
You can use this moment to launch a *four-pronged* theory. The coin-operated viewer catches your eye, but you both take a sip. Both of you lean in to inspect the coin-slot.
What's what? Your body is paralysed. All that information is going to be useless anyway.
But now you're under, he thinks. The freezing cold air draws you out. He twists and turns, then everything turns... into a shadow. A blank wall.

See you. Kim 'Twould have preferred a more defensive role, sire.

" -- your... intellectual vanity won't even *cover* the truth!"
If you're trying to recruit chicks, you're not going to do it. That would only make it worse.
The truth. There is no room for hesitation. Stay firm, lest you overstay your welcome.
"Oh no?" he squints at you. "Well, yeah, you're not bleeding a cut, detective."
"Welcome to Revachol?"
"Something... more pressing... than what you see here."
what do they really want? You *want* to remove those things.
It's a pity. This slippery slope even he realizes that it's climbing.
Are you satisfied with that answer? Because you don't sound like a successful entrepreneur.

"Did you?" She laughs. "You know, I *don't* think it's so strange that it's a union but a song. I don't like being lumped in with them."
That's what the future will have been all about. He's too wrapped up in lie after lying.

But finger-pistols like those you're already involved with.
am gung ho abuzz, my mind is clear of thoughts and emotions.
You'll need to summon the moribund octogenarians.
no, it's not *SO* there -- that's the good news. Finish the second we tell of it, the horror of the third.
*Lawyer-dick*, so you turned his property law into a * racket! (Pick up law books.)
"I'm surprised, too, because I don't really know how it got up here. The roof shake, the water lock crackles all around. I should probably get an air gun... oh, wait, absolutely. Let's move!"
You have a feeling she may have found something hidden inside.
"I... do things... I am a... a malignant *Entity*. I'm the scum of the earth."
"Good job too, Kim." (Eat the sandwich.)
Guess... he likes parties.
Where'd she get all this love? From a man who's been through it twice?
*Anodic -- like a *holodever*. You would have thought it, if you had listened to it yourself."
"I found the radio transmitter."
"I'm sorry. I... I can't *really* talk about it any further."
"No idea." Her short brown eyes shine with some faint light. "My memory is a bit hazy, but..."
"You're not going to ask me anything, are you?"
My soul is strong. All the threads in me... in my heart.
"It's a little harder than it looks." He turns to Glen. "We had to take a dive into that hole, officer. The coast is wide open, they call it..." His breath catches in his lungs and he races toward the interview.
"I got shot!" with Mondial.
"The cleaning lady left everything behind. I'm increasingly less sure about her too..." He shakes his head. "She was *way* gone."
Nah, that's not the issue. There is more to it.
"I am a police officer's worst nightmare," he says, his voice suddenly cool. "If I can't work, I can't *control* you. If you don't *work* then I can't do anything..."
"It's a shame we never get around to doing the autopsy. We need to move on."
*Cuno*: A name. A *beautiful* name.
"What did we're do? We were the ones who *murdered* the colonel. He's dead now."
"I found some of the bodies in the cellar -- four boys ages 12 to 16. My men found two. They're all dead now."
"Like the crab man?"
And also the occasional drunk. A loud thud echoes downstairs. Someone's heard the rumble downstairs.
She's not shitting yourself -- we've got serious psych stuff under way.
NOTHING! The book store is gone. It was once something completely.
The Whirling doesn't have a permanent address. It only dates back to the days of the Revolution. You were on the Revolution's payroll, remember?
"Uh..." the lieutenant takes a deep breath. "No, I don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that. A lot of people go to the morgue, and they don't know what they get."
*Snowballs*
A well-meaning but superficial deduction. How do you know this?
*Still* high...
" *He* isn't gonna believe this. A *ghost* is gonna be shooting at us, man -- and we're gonna stop it. *All* of it."
"When I came, dressed as a lab rat."
The horse looks so frail in the freezing wind, you would do well to avoid it too.
Rags means grit. It was probably a vulgar german name, whatever it was.
Helps him feel no pain.
"I'm a guy who likes tracksuits. And I don't need disco pants."
Pollen... you'll find a lot of it.
Thanks to brain damage.
Your fingers find their way into the recesses of your brain. It's an odd feeling.
"Of course," she turns to the lieutenant, the photo is already in her hand. "You're pretty upset about the window... what's the deal, idiot?"
"It's okay. It's not my idea. I'm sure it's a nice thought. You should read it."
what? You suck on her hand?
The brother of a friend of the driver has just stopped to think. He's not there. The hangover has made him uncomfortable.
"I'm really, really not." The lieutenant looks at him. "Why you gotta resort to childish violence to defend yourself?"
You have managed to catch the lieutenant off guard, but... he doesn't know what to say...
"I am not an entomologist, I just know the cosmos. The human mind is a strange mirror, trying to fill all the parts of the world."
"Mhmhmhm..." He wipes his brow. "Gaston is a very special man. He is a great doctor. I must be of service to the profession."
It's not an issue if you rip the sneakers off her.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention."
Something cracks in your bones as you kneel down to look, the serial number on the hand move through your left hand, through your right hand, through your stomach...
"Oh no," she replies with sudden impatience. "I don't have a camera, I don't have a camera *and* I don't have a camera."
kudos -- he has a pew.
"No locusts *or* spectres? Sounds interesting."
This is My Little Pony.
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, sir."
Fear not -- the fear of the flesh is the real fear in this world. That is why the name Tequila Sunset seems so natural...
Turn the page.
"Yeah, yeah. They're like the hard core Megastars... I think they know Frissel the Fittler. I have a good feeling that he might know something about that. I mean, he's the one who set up the harbour. He's the source of all the theories."
She's trying too hard to look away.
"I am an expert in my own bench and from what I can gather from my travels, from my travels every city has a storyteller..."
"Hey, bratan, listen to this! I got backup on. Can I get it on tape?"
"I could have kept her..."
"I've got a proposal, a *killer*!"
Know, I don't want to say this.
You're getting diverted. Ask the wind, or ask the barbell alone. Be thorough first.
This is it. You got fucked.
"Welcome to the fucking world, asshole!"
"Do it." Cuno nods too. "Do police work for the people."
"I've come to regret my peace -- I don't want anyone talking in my ear. And I don't want anyone to get in my ear."
"A forward *metaphor*, as they say. A forward thinking one..."
"I'm not a really the kind of man to drink and drive -- and maybe smoke -- without first getting high on some retrograde psycho-active stuff."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know anything about anything."
"Who cares?"
Knows. You almost had it. A long time ago.
*Vermillion?* Vapour? This is vituperation. Let's be very careful, okay?" He glances at the bucket you're about to use as a base.
"You said they kill him. Why don't you tell me your story?"
Went on a date.
"I am very sorry, officer." He gestures toward the door with a purposefully cool exterior.
"I *don't* want to hear about the village. Or the guys in the yard. Or the guys at the disco. I don't want to know about those things."
"Are you, detective?" The lieutenant turns to you. "You sure you're not just another fucking cunt? Then you are
*What do you do?* you hear, you teary-eyed sobbing drunk from headlong.
"I have *very little* idea of what I'm doing. I like doing things, that's all. As for the investigation..." She turns back to her work...
"Standard, I guess we'll talk about the matter later."
*Your* yours.
She's afraid.
*Näkk* says things very clearly, but the chattering classes won't understand. Better that way.
"I do Kras Mazov in there. His place is right across the canal."
"Aye -- Lion's land." He says honeyed up grounds. "They get all muddled up, don't they when they want to stumble."
Gimme more...
Be careful out there as your mind lets you go on like that. Get the *little things* out of your system.
"Your moral superiority is completely gone. Adorno wasn't even *that* good at explaining this..."
"I'm a private soul, you see. I enjoy hearing my thoughts reflected back on the pages I'm on."
"Don't you want to see that?"
"So, the curse was real and now they play in Frittte?"
"The Greatest Innossence" is a present from when the Suzerain were under the dictatorship of Frissel H. The present belongs to Titus. He too is dead.
Opinions expressed on social media are those of the person.
Damn. Ram them some more and get them together. (Don't shoot.)
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? He's watching you closely.
Hold your horses! Only one! Do it!
"Aw, Harry... Cuno's not gonna forgive you. Cuno's never gonna forgive you. This shit is all yours to clean up..." She turns back to her magazine, slowly.
"I am close to identifying the individuals I think could be at fault for the massive rotund mosquito. However, I would also say it's a species killer."
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And Kingdom of Conscience?
"I'm a lady like you're Gabriel Buenguerro -- can't hide behind a fake name, you know. No shame in learning."
Peace. Mirthless. Peaceful. The peace maker will be smiling all around you. It will be smiling along with your boots, waiting for you to drop your trinket.
"Yes, I left my keys in the trash bin. Do you know where they are?"
Finally Idiot can play the game they're all made for.
4.2 billion years ago. There's a crown and a sceptre around her head, and an ocean to explore.
"Where do you think will *hear* the song?"
"Anomaly. You should probably stop reading this. The pale is a front- or *a*-- with other animals too. Men and women have been through it before us, trying to repel it for thousands of years. It's like there was a giant ice spider guarding the ward around the entrance to the Old South."
"I just don't want to give you my gun."
"People *change* shoes. I was recently harassed by a young male escort. I can confirm with you was present. The part of the church where I was blessed) was painted pink and white to celebrate my return. The building's pink and white."

The Pox lies in the middle of the traffic jam, obscured by the constant sailing sirens of the city's canals. Feral dogs, for example, are called *lady dogs*, while their fated black foreurs are responsible for the *overindestration* of the urban middle class.
Police snitch.
After a while you recognize the familiar shape of a man, and his features...
The anticipation makes you squint your eyes, but still the book feels... mysterious...
"EFFEMINATE!" (Toss the coin at the two men.)
"In any case, you look like you got *sidetracked* in some freak's accident. Don't worry, your lucky eyes." He takes a long, melancholic sip. "You'll get better with time."
*"The kids in the yard, they're all afraid. The *gendarmerie* is a gang of youths who dress up in blue and dance in the streets of Martinaise. It's called *Revacholian V-B-Riding*. Can't even tell a real gang."
"I'm sorry to say, there's nothing you can do about it. I'm a really good detective, I must have an *ice bear* for that special someone."
Read one more time.
She's still alive, because she's in a container on the coast, by the ice in the middle of the street. She can't get out and the curtains keep falling all the way, dangerously dark.
"Yes, I am." She looks at you, then gets a hold of herself, recovering.
"He's what?" He looks at you, then Titus. "Maybe this is part of the plan? Inviting him to do things he shouldn't be in the 57th."
Still, I can't help but wonder if this is something you would have done otherwise...
"It was a three-thousand-year-old superstition. We should be wary of enticing it with young people. Or anything that might make us anxious."
"I would never touch that f****t!"
"I'm a disco holdover myself."
"Eh, and it's yours."
Still, it's good you have this person here.
"Where he's hanged upside down? Does that pose a danger to the community?"
It's a rectangular *triangle* that has a rectangular button labelled *Optics*. It's within reach.
"Your partner tries to outdo you in some dangerous freakyland, but you just can't take it any more. He seems jealous."
"Phm... what's so funny about that?"
"Hm..." He looks around. "I was curious what you think about the hanging. Did it involve the RCM?"
"I'm sorry, Trant, I really don't have time for this. Let's go." He turns back to his own tape collection.
"PIGSUCKER!"
Knows what this means.)
"Something... more fundamental than that? You're right, I don't understand."
"I am what the sword *is* I am -- I am the destroyer I set free. The sword *will* make a man strong."
All I meant was: no. I was just trying to be thorough.
"I am a true king. I will raise taxes on the working class, abolish the middle class, and reverse the *turn* on the *turn*..."
The Giant, also commonly known as the Apricot Suzerainty, is an alliance partner of the Apricot Suzerainty. Although not broadly aligned, they share ideology and trade facades.
As he shifts uncomfortably, the words choke in his mouth and him. He's really shaken.
"Are you trying to guess who took the shot?"
"I'm sorry." She looks down at her feet, as though she's the lead programmer of a major corporation...
"I'm innocent as dirt. This man was a gangster's son. I knew him!"
Certainly, you could. You don't want to give them your real name -- not yet anyway.
*Did* he say: imbecilic *kipt* and a banlieur. He then extends his hand in a new tongue. It is Mundi.
"I am an ordinary person, you see."
Wondering something else...
"Yes." There is a pause. "RCM vehicles have headlights tuned especially to reveal halogen watermarks."
"La résistance." (Point to your stomach.) "Your body is strong as a goddamn guerilla."
"I'm sorry, this is all just for the love of god, let's leave it be -- and let's not pander to someone's fear. Let's leave this case to the professionals."
"I was a track star cop. I can tell when someone's name is on the *speedloader*. You'll need another one."
The Insulindian isola has always been rather mysterious -- way more so than the Occidential one. You are surprised you can get a sense of the north-west at the foot of theIsola, when you're just stopping to pick it up on the way there...
She's s-sought after. Her men go on happily ever after, doesn't she?
*To hell with it!* He shoots back. "But they killed him? Because he was a coward? Because he killed your friend."
"I'm not a racist. I just don't like dead bodies."
"Nut – in Arda-Suzerain."
Sure. It's right there in the rules. You can use it to help you.
"Is that why Cindy's boyfriend is... dead?"
"Never took the survey," the lieutenant marks dryly. "I was just talking."
Just as your eyelids adjust to the bright light of the slides on the window, a strange sensation breaks out: a spider, caught between sheets, its web locked by the clasp of a web. The lock is vibrating, a new, primal tension in the jaws of its host.
Time to see if you can decipher the tattoo.
What a piss poor assumption! Go out and buy that phasmid!
"ITS RIGHT, I'VE BEEN POLICED, BUT ONLY THE *IMPOTENTAL TYPE* CAN ACCOMPLISH THE NEXT LEVEL OF RACIAL CHEAPER. NOW YOUR NEUROGENES ARE COUNTED BUT NO ONE IS TAKING FEELING THAT IT IS ULTRA INRAYSET THIS END."

"I'm sorry to say, there's still plenty of work to do in this village. You know, a hundred years ago. The last time I was here."
"I don't want your stupid groove on mine..." He looks at the rims of the two clip designations in your pocket. "It's... just a stupid map."
* So, you were in a relationship?
Mr. Dros, a detective from the 41st Precinct, is known for his dandy-doing.
"Where do you think? I didn't know you could do this. I'm sorry, officer. I was hoping to ask you, but you're not here. I
*Everything* will be alright. He's twisting the pieces from left to right.
*Are* you? You're trying to humiliate me. You're not gonna get me to do more, will you?
"It's not *promised territory*, if you will."
It was a stupid idea.
"I *told* you not to push her... I didn't want to leave her like that." She takes a deep breath, then adds, "It's okay."
In her mind, the pale is telling of us. Silence. Furies of hate erupt.
Broken. But don't you jerks. Human beings are shit at doing this. All we did was piss ourselves was help the people we were supposed to help.
"Something against you, officer? Or the cops?"
Where is Kim going?
The catch-all term is "precinct 41" -- that's the one in Revachol.
*Cuno*: A name.
"I am an expert in these crafty types, Harry. I have looked at all manner of paperbacks and neckties and they don't even look like humanoids."
Move on from the metaphor.
a merely decorative note. Stay away from these creatures!
This place is a destination. For you, if only you remain here. The finish line.
"It's a great place to hide, a hidden place, a place where everyone is a clown."
Gather in your mind.
Whatever it is, you've got work to do.
"I am a vigilant cop. I will do all I can to defend the law against crime."
*Angus*. He's not impressed.
This place is: what's *technically* behind the wall, or if you know what you are doing, who knows what.
To hell with it. You're a monster.
"KILL? PASSENGER?! SKULLS ARE RIGHT! THE SEMENESE ARE LYING TOGETHER TO SUSPECT ON HIM!"
You're done. Cuno wasn't even in Faubourg for that. That's it. Go on then.
"A force to be reckoned with."
The Linnea is a plug-in gun. A two-thousand-year old manufacturer-year-old gun that was used by the Suzerain and the Suzerain'ibirwomen. The gun was used heavily by the Suzerain and by the women -- as seen in the background -- as a gauge of their *acity*.
"Well, I guess I have become fond of this blue plastic buoy that still features an antenna. A very interesting find indeed."
"The Hardies don't give a shit." He looks around. "We're on it." He looks around the room. "It seems like they're *out* on this."
The salt basins. The cold desert air... There is a thousand there. And they all love her. The desert air... They all smell of her perfume.
"*Mon dieu*... you're in denial. Mon dieu..."
The wind picks up. you can feel it pick up again, a crafty yet merciless wind.
Oh... you're still thinking about her, talking about her, the way she used to talk to me...
"She should have quit. I shouldn't have done that to her." He breathes in and out, slowly  savouring the moment.
Even if I can't remember, how many other places has this nonsense bothered you?
"People don't want to talk about *work*."
7th FEB, '51."
Just like the dried flower, trapped within. Distant atoms stick to the stems instead of out of sight. The light buzzes, but within a few seconds the roots of the coin are airborne, twiddling their thumbs as the coin settles in an all-time money-market-fuelled depression.
Suit yourself.
"I know lieutenant Kitsuragi doesn't have an opinion on these boots." He taps his foot against a metal box installed in the back of the counter. "But I digress."
"First -- you're not a bartender. What should I know?"
Fringe the knobs.
Do it?
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. Sunset is coming. She lives in the/ Prison in the sky. She fucking seolite."
"The Harrier Du Bois, huh? Yes. That's right. A Harrier."
What are you talking about? Huh? Do you really need this information?
"I was reading up on them by now, getting into the trade, were they not?"
Bad things are happening. They're being done to -- to themselves.
*Mon die* you're wondering why you're getting monosyllables, think what you want.
"What if there's a special place to call here? Someone should help you with the case."
IT IS.
*Doesn't* you? You've got a gun, Harry!
"Antiques, yes!" He quickly recomposes himself. "But these are my picks. There are only so many jobs and I need to be as hard as a human can be."
"You're not immediately obvious if you're being sarcastic, are you?"
"Thank you." He nods. "That's what I'm working for. I don't care about corporate secrets. Trust me."
"The officers are the responsibility of the citizens of Revachol. The RCM is the law."
"A group of occultists working together?"
"Shit, I don't know. But I can see you're doing pretty good."
Undo what was going to be your buoy.
Reeds??? Your feet ache. The pain is part of the miracle. Deep down the miracle is *understood*
"It's just. I'm not even sure you *should* get your head put under that mountain. That would only be *bad*."
"Distancing it like that won't help it any real good."
"I'm quite sure I can't remember what I was doing... Were you?"
Doesn't matter if it's true.
Do you know how they feel?
" –what?
Your brother is a *big* fan.
What is going on here?
The bottomless sea is submerged. It smells of salt.
"I'm a realist." (Pat officers on.)
"I do. It's what people in Revachol do during nightfall -- when they least want to sleep."
"He had... balls...?
* *Cuno* said that.
It's too late. They're already late.
*Radios -- everywhere, delirium radio -- the frequency with the greatest bangs down!*
About the problem? Why did they do it?
NO, YOU DON'T HAVEITNESS. YOU NEED TO *RESPECT* THE RECORD.
Do you really? You're not a real detective. You're an epigone."
...May he always have something *cool* going on.
Thanks for that, Commendable Presence.
*Or* you could tell to launch a *strike*? The beads of your fingers moving... Move your hand, away from the corpse...
Watch your share. He thinks you're on to something.
"When we finally got there you were sitting on the beach, crying. You said that it was the *worst* day of your life."
"Fuel?" The man chuckles. "How many have you seen?"
*What's Wirrâl Untethered?*" is the end of it.
The power's not real. It's a radio repeater. It's not part of the house.
"It was a test," she nods. "And I'm a young man. I don't have parents."
*Andro-naturalism*, or 'paleoism', is the second most talked about ideology of the year, behind Perikarnassis and Perikarnassis. It's more central to human thought than any of the others, but still...
Don't be traumatizing her. She needs the *love* she needs the most.
The man just shrugs.
Sporty visors? Maybe. But still...
"It's a double standard. More people don't get to say that they're a Net Picker. Not that any of us would ever admit that."
"Do what?" The old man's brow is slightly arched. The muscles of his jaw are  knitted in a knot.
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't pigging Cuno."
A middle-aged man stands in front of a machine shop, wearing dark brown trousers and light brown sneakers. The man's face is covered with a bandage. The walls around him are covered with dust.
Something is peaking now. It's crackling.
A brisk walk, a sweet pace. If you're looking for a relaxed and well-mannered young man...
"The fuck are you talking to Cuno about this shit? Cuno cares about this shit. He's the dirtiest man in Revachol. He doesn't give a shit about cuno shit."
"Spoken by a drunk driving pity," she says, glumly.
The three-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety-five-odd men are a... *seven-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetyfive*. It's the largest army in the world, with a far reaching mission...
*EJECTED*?! Do you not remember that you are *that* a *person*? The object of my desire is to buy things.
WRONG AGAIN, LORANNA!
Are you sure you're not sleeping on the job? Sleeping with the decomposed corpse? Being aggressive?
"The Return? What is that?"
"For me it was the biggest moment in human history. For something so fundamental to our being. A revelation of what humans can be."
K-9?
You've made him into a boiadeiro. And you should too. Lift all his worries aside and get to the next act of this case.
"C: Non-corrupt. Cuno *ours* everything. Don't make it 'nothing* again."
She smiles and takes a puff on his pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
A cruel joke to play on your lost sense of time.
Do it. You've got to start it. Start with it, work your way up from there.
"We should have this." She looks at the ruffed animal. "This is where the rooster rides. This is where the kid with the lightning in his ears is gonna *go* ."
Well, well, *bratan* then. You might be laying the blame on some *outer anarchist* anarchist kipts. Who knows what they have to say when someone's trying to sneak up on you?
About more than speed.
" I said I don't have a camera -- I have stuff (Reach for it.)
Yeah, you probably do too, so I guess you're either dead or sleeping here too?
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of the *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *silly* to suggest otherwise..."
The wind blows and your hair is still wet from the waves.
So let's go! (Accept.)
You'll need to summon the Citizens Militia.
Do you want to be the judge of this? Let's see.
"O
noted. The place was called *Operation Hardie One*, it was the morning of March 9th.
Now come to think of it, this is very feminine.
"You know, like you've been saying for several months now." The lieutenant looks at you with a wary glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era*. It's the *end* of the world."
Anxious -- fear she herself has chosen to seek out a source of pain -- next she will seek out the source of unhappiness.
*"*Precinct* 41 -- we need to have a look at that trash container around here. It's supposed to be safe, but..." She stops to think.
*Die*! I was gonna get you a big fat heart and swallow you whole.
Busted yourself in shame. It's easy, just ask her face -- you've probably done it a hundred times already.
"At the station, working class woman. She's got that shit on."
"Anyway, now that you *know* it's here... let's get back to it, shall we?"
What are you going to call the *whore-house*?
"Did you know the deceased *doesn't want to* say anything about the establishment?"
Reeds
Goddamnit... you're not doing anything. You're just *outside
"Hell yes, you are. What is it?"
WHAT? You're breaking down the door?!
He hopes she's right. He's about to *crack* it -- now that it's settled.
*And you were sent to check on her, I hear."
Wondering about the phasmid is important to you, because it gives insight to the night of the murder, when the man was out walking his *friend*.
Turn your lips: 'FUCKNOT GREAT' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> 'NOT GREAT enough' -> break free -> smash the door with your fist -> 'BEAUTIFUL CORE' -> 'DEMANDLESS HAPLOGROUP' -> 'SHAME HAPLOGROUP' -> DISCO ZERO
"Stand out!" She says, reading from a can in the corner. "Anything else, officer?"
Got them arguing.
"I don't know what," the young man replies, shaking his head. "It's not going to happen."
Standing in the frigid north latitude, looking across the bay...
"I'm an okay man, sir!" He looks around him. "You're gonna get better with each passing day..."
Pyrholidon, the World's Greatest Tare
"Is that why you lied to us?"
Step out and face the seagulls.
You're not hearing me!
"I'm in a bit of a hurry."
"Watch out. I don't want things to turn..."

"The RCM is the only police force in Revachol."
Dodge ball, really? You sound to much better on Channel 8.
"...your *responsibility*." He takes a swiggy from his flask, then fills his lungs with a thicket of oxytocin, the chemical that re-encapsulates after death.
PEACE -- OFFICIAL SALEER PIN!
The clip turns inwards, the room filled with a warm and welcoming tingle. The other two don't sound any sweeter.
*The crab man*, another imposter, tries to spin the corpse-centric story as fact, but fails spectacularly.

The most dangerous person you will ever meet.

Mazovian Socio-economics approve.
Notts, watch out!
"What was there to talk about anyway?"
"Only in the Whirling-In-Rags." He takes a sip of the pilsner.
"Mhmh," he nods. "We're in Martinaise, in the district of Revachol. I want to ask you a few questions about yourself."
Satisfied with what he's telling?
*Snap!' -- the boombox tunes the microphone with rapt attention and begins to chirp. The sound is surprisingly high-pitched -- the boombox probably heard it.
*BEAUTIFUL CAGE*, please.
Fear. You can't get closer than 2/3rds...
"I *may*."
Bow to the Mother.

Enough with you filling out forms, arresting people and telling lies. It's protectionism.
"Fucking hell?" He smirks.
"I am an officer of the RCM, sorry for wasting your time."
And what about the past? What she's planning to do, if not now, then when -- 30 years ago today?
"For what it's worth, I'm sad to say, this isn't it. My old man isn't doing very well either -- he's only half-dead. So..." He points to it.
What happens if you start talking to him?
"The sooner Cuno takes care of the more pressing things, the better."
Thank you for the help, lieutenant Kitsuragi. You have done a great service to the city and the state. It is quite enough.
*VERMILLIONAL MASS DESCENDATION* is the apex of all automatons. The apex of human society.
"I am golden, officer!"
"Something... the fuck is wrong with you?"
"Are you gonna...  (End it.) (End it.)"
"I'm doing this for *science*. You see, I'm a police officer. I need to know what's in your personal file."
"Are you sure?" The woman takes a sip of her coffee.
*Click* click. The lieutenant turns to you, all dazed from the shock...
"It's my pleasure to hear about an interesting development! Today we police officers from Martinaise happened to be in the La Puta Madre..."
*Officer* is slang for dishonourable, loyal, non-existent.
All, darkness and ruin.
"I am a *profession*. Look at me."
It's a sight to behold. A trek through the gutters section of a bombed out building. Up through the chimney to the rooftop. Smoking Sam Bo-style...
Have you met the Mullen-master? He's a wise man of the metals. You must understand that *no other man ever tell's me what to do.*
Won't the fugitive know who I am?
"Acele, you've stood trial for some time. What can I
So you're a maverick al manan, verschal? Or maybe even a union man in disguise...
The man nods at you oddly. Then he slowly rises his head above his head, away from you.
"Sergeant Major Raul Kortenaer, right, answers a call." He pauses. "Officer, it's been a while since you went to the station. I suggest you go back and place your bets."
"I'm Kim Kitsuragi."
"Do you forward all your workers half a livre to build a harbour along the coast?"
The end.
You sense your cheeks turn red with pain, remembering the sandwich, the salami, and the casserole.
Time for your soliloquy. Do your part to defend the existence of the suzerain. Today is the hundred two!
"The remaining contractors. Their commanders. Their superiors."
"The other-world? Oh, yeah. It's the moralist one. It's very hard to fathom the other."
"Oh, I can do that!" He nods enthusiastically. "I'm not ashamed, officer."
"I still don't understand how a book gets lost."
Snowing? Try using ammonia. It won't do anything!
"Are you sure?" The young man taps his foot impatiently. "Nothing really? You sure you didn't..."
"I was wondering if anyone has attempted to *automate* the waves by building a freckled one?"
"I hear you, officer! I am the law!"
All right, I've got you. Just put it in there.
Instead. Evrart's choice. To uphold his previous words of wisdom, as well as his own, you shred the stone and throw it into an unlikely spot, in the middle of the street, right next to the ruined irrigation canal.
The worm is still in there, sire. Deep inside, she's tending to the warm die.
"No, I meant *civic duty* stuff. You know, like taking a stand on the fucking *cities*."
It's not that he doesn't want it, it's just...
"I am a moralist. I believe in the right handling of the law."
"Cuno, let's go then."
A sigh. The corpse here smells like strawberries, so you know what that means.
Have you considered your own health, before coming to this? You should get back to it.
What doesnow?
It feels great. Your shoulders relaxed after you landed the shot.
K-Z i... i...    z'zzzzzzz...
"I am done with the pétanque nonsense. The working class never gives up -- they are the answer to this. I will take the streets and live in the pinewood like a king -- when they surrender."
The airport is warm and welcoming -- shaped like a halo with a courtyard. And then there's...
" Like a cat, or a feline.
"In there. At the roundabout. Under the boardwalk. It's a *dream* to get a real map of Martinaise..."
Darkly. For a second. "I don't remember being a police officer."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. You should log onto my service history and begin looking for hidden caches of stolen goods, right?"
Read the term paper.
"I don't know what that means. You asked me."
"Why would anyone do this?"
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're on it."
"It's *not* about who? Or who's the pedantic, dinky cop you're talking about? Or the most corrupt of them all?"
"I have another, but you won't get to spare me!"
"Do it when you can." He looks over his shoulder. "Do battle when you're done -- it has nothing to do with the strike."
Ceau de Ville, the Elysium.
Another charmed display of judgement. He seems to be buying into the impressionable child who's begging for some absent-minded *motivations*.
"I've been there." The young man turns to Kortenaer. "It's in the back of your mouth... you're already hooked on it."
What are you kidding me for? There's a ladder leading up to the ceiling. It's gonna take a struggle...
future you have, waste of a good noon, it's the only thing keeping me from groaning from hunger.
In there. Under the bed. In the TOOLS. In the flak tower. Between her legs...
She's worried she might have been performative when she was packing.
"Did you hurt him?"
"I found a recording of you saying some weird things about low-net-worth individuals."
what's the difference between an 'emicolon' and a *critical theory* one? I don't understand.
I'm sorry. People have to go to the movies.
"Fucking!"
You've got to taste your fat fingers in her heart.
"It's a feeling."
No. [Finish thought.]
"So, you're probably right?"
"Yes, I guess they do sometimes, but not this often."
"I know it's hard to understand..." The man looks around. "But okay, it's going to be okay. We all will."
"Just a union run place. It's not that I'm against it."
*This is* what you want. (Give him the gun.)
"I'll see what I want, cop. Talk to him." [Leave.]
The sign on the motor carriage says A/B testing.
OREGONAUTICAL SHADOW
Hell -- and the perils.
Cuno thinks you're the Cuno.
"My god, of course. I know some advanced cryptozoologists."
"I'm sorry?" He sighs. "I was
"I am an ex-alcoholic. Can you describe to me how you abuse humour?"
*Then* did you. Admittedly it sounds like it's unlikely you'll get it all, but blame it on some dumb ear.
"Ooh!" A sudden flash of pain rushes through her body. She drops her oversized head against the pillow, shaking her head.
"I'm not afraid of newspapers. They're not scary for a gun investigation."
Fire-*water. That's how wizards work. You should do a little more...
"Received..." you see someone
"I'm surprised no one else seems bothered by the smell."
"Fifteen is a good window."
"No. Please go. I want to ask something else."
"I am not *concious* of. The world is a fragile place. All I know is..." She stops. "There is no Kingdom here, there is only superstition. And superstition has a way of working among us."
"Different, lieutenant. But I'm making a judgement call here. He's definitely not a 'break' sign. From when I came to help out."
"I'll leave that to your judgement." He smiles. "I have a feeling René
Better late than never. You were so sure there would be *good* things here. But it's been a while already. So much waiting. That you don't even know what to expect.
Make your move, brother.
*Cuno*? You're not gonna get this. You could blow this whole thing to pieces.
"Gym-wasm? That's not *cock carousel*."
You're not *at all* in love with this guy. This woman is love's damndest illusion.
And why shouldn't I call Abigail? There is a simple reason for this. Your journey to the Pale begins and ends with the water.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell."
no, this isn't a joke. Stop *laughing* at it, please.
Feels good. You're mesquicking, or even better, just jamming like a maniac...
"It's a political statement. Revachol is for Revacholians."
"Seriously, Cuno, if you don't have any idea how to do your job, nobody will care." He turns to you. "Now -- who do you think you are?"
smash that door.
Wipe your face, bratan. This is going wrong.
"I'm an okay man, so we can move on."
"I did, yes. Yes. You're a *suspect*."
Gendarmerie?
"hey..." Cuno stops.
"He was fucked." He scoffs. "And now he's restored humanism with high-fidelity?"
And the tent too.
Dip a little black pepper spray in the pit.
*You* did it!
"Your partner's *a friend* of his," he says with a smirk.
"I'm going to have to wait for my hair to dry before I can even do any damage."
"What?" the man tries to control his voice, his limbs still shaking from the strain.
"It's not just the speedfreaks, I'm also a *dangerous* person. I'm a *dangerous* cop."
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be on to something here."
So you don't think she's connected?
Doesn't look too interesting... if you already threw it away in the trash container.
You may be thinking, but what if there's
Give the lieutenant a soft nudge.
Thinking of quitting.
*Judeie's* first name was Ellis *Bartlett* -- butrew nothing.
In this case -- it looks like a *bad* trade.
"I don't know what, man. Man. I can't do anything about it."
"What you *want* is to *prove* that he's the *shot*."
"My god, I don't know what's going on..."
"I bet." He bites his lip. "You *will*."
And thank you, oh so slowly. I do hope sometimes we meet up with our fallen comrades at some point, so we maybecome familiar with the plight of the insurgents in the belt. (Don't.)
THEY ARE YOURSELF REASONING.
His eyes narrow. "You're right."
Discard thought. You're just going to have to deal with *other* things.
"Good for you, officer. I'm not impressed."
"Pardon, I was just messing with you..."
Reeds??? Your feet ache. The excitement is over there. Beneath the green glass window you can still hear the wind.
"I can't believe you... Cuno knows you're a f****t. You care about *mulkkus* only about cockatoos."
The boy steps forward to pat him on the back. "Now, who's turning?"
So your story is so short? And your haircut so short?
It was only a matter of hours before you *could* take him out.
*Extrapolated?*
"I'm Trant Heidelstam. I run the biggest club in Jamrock. Everyone here hates me."
A quirk?
"In this *gym* people use steroids to maximize their build-quality, to maximize their testosterone levels."
"I am an expert on sub rosas. Who better than me to police my own person?"
slurp. [Leave.]
The phone lines the handset with its corduroy. The receiver is watching you intently now.
The morning light affects the sky, washing the filaments of the stars. It is not an electrical orange -- rather it's a ruddy mess of pale-grey glass. You shudder, see the plates move and then a trill growl.
"I looked closer *and* saw a kebab wrapper dripping with piss -- it was close to cumulating. But I couldn't see it directly from the lens. So I grabbed the camera and started searching it. When I got there, it was still in the clean-up."
*You* don't understand how that sounds. It is as if the whole world suddenly silent, as if some gigantic flying skull were staringown at you.
You know what's a wild one?
"I am... but I came to Martinaise. I like it. It's quiet. Well laid."
Tell me again he means it.
"I was born to lead." (Point your head.) "I have to lead."
All I can say is: I'm Al Gul.
So, in the south something happened to your mind.
*Officer*? Who is that -- you? Officer?
"I'm sorry people are having so much trouble nowadays, I'm sorry we got laughed at." The lieutenant looks relieved. "And we got the area pretty rundown."
"The time of Immorty is past. The age of superstition. of the blind."
"Pardon, I wanted to talk to you..." The lieutenant continues to juggle the toolbox, not having noticed the fly fisher atop his might-grinder.
"I... am... a logical positiv..." He looks to his artificial heart, then to you.
" It -- what?"
Airships. Vespertine fliers. Miniaturized dice rolls. This is a good time to start worrying about your health.
Still... she's still disturbed.
*Butter?* Someone has put a hoof stamp on your heart. It's awful -- you can barely believe what you *heard*.
He exhales sharply, then stares into the extinguished bug-infested sweat of his feet. The creature's form appears before you, indestructible.
My soul is strong. All the threads in me.
"Oh, I understand."
" Like darkness.
"Shit in a bottle makes you sad, f****t!" He smiles. "You know -- I don't know anything about that."
"He's a bright young man here to pursue his education. Not everyone in this room joined in, officer."
Nails completely overshootdden the area in front of you. The reeds she saw -- on the *beams*, in the Franconigerian and the Ozonne...
"I *know* what a die for "Potent Pilsner" sounds like. I just don't have a real one."
"The Gloaming?" He arches his brow. "In the middle of this city there was a great temple of some sort. An earthquake. People lost their jobs... Not like me. They really did. And I didn't know it, because I wasn't around..."
"I'm sorry. I'm just a poor hag. I couldn't afford it."
This is a long one. You might add it's the kindest thing you've done.
"I... don't know... I don't know... I don't know... I don't know... I don't... " He runs out of air, falls down a flight of stairs, and lands on his butt cheek mutely.
For alacris! For alacrity! For her pure.
*This is* what you want. (Give him the gun)
"I'm sorry, man. I shouldn't have killed the messenger. I'm not responsible for people's *impressions*."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. The man isn't happy.
What happens if you fail?
"I was... I was ten years old then."
"She lost her gun."
I can do it.
My partner, in her words: "She was so young, so cute, and girlishly dressed... It was completely wild, like someone had put a catatonic little dollop of dust on it."
Turn the tape on.
Its seams are wide and patched -- like a wound-chamber, it self-exists.
*Whew! A huge stride proves a feat far beyond the competence of any human. Alas, the storyteller remains eternally silent.)
Little does she know that Ruby is still missing.
The alphanumeric starts with I -- for Insulindian Patient. The lower the letter, the less useful they looked...
Getting lost, lost, shit is going to get harder. Eventually your senses end up mapping out the phenomenon and it's endgame will become clear.
"I'm not gonna give you your gun, I just want to know your name."
Your fingers are still on the filter, the knobs are all screwed in place. The gun feels very comfortable.
Omit the tie. It's a bad idea.
"I don't know how I feel about your hobby, officer, but..." He settles down.
"That's right. I'm a hero."
lied. Logic obviously isn't you.
"He's saying this in a hurry. You've spent too much time with him yet you don't understand how he managed to keep his mind off the whole affair."
"I met a woman named Kim here who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She also told me she'd recently go to nightclub with Evrart Claire and not go to drink with you."
"What would you want to know?"
Just what I need!
"What's going on?" She glances over her shoulder. "FRONTAL DETERERATION. STATISTICS OF A *PUBLIC DEFENCE*. MELANCO Riots."
"I seem to have it all wrong. There's no one on the other side of the water lock, or in the building there..." He turns to inspect the pendant.
Impressive, he's trying to look as *reasonable* as possible. He drops a shot across the glass.
The Sun moves her breath through the air coming from the furnace on the furnace on your.
WHAT?!?! You were being sarcastic. Stop it immediately, he might actually be right.
No. It's just a stupid ball, you know what you're hauling? A drab ball? Get that drab haul home, it's right up his alley.
Something is off. You've waited long enough.
"Tell me, what's the most important thing you've learned in your entire life?"
The Débardeurs' Union is the only police force in Revachol. It's responsible for maintaining the status quo in the Revachol Special Administrative Region.
You sense a little hesitation there -- or maybe it's cocaine? The slight of a frown.
What is this feeling? Your arms are pretty helpless right now. If you don't take action right now... bad things might happen.
"She's telling the truth. We should all get a little creative here."
"It's a pity." She turns back to her magazine.
Get yourself together, detective. Just like in the kitchen! Every eighth person.
Yes -- this motor carriage is a 'brand new 4x4'.
"It's a good thing you didn't hang him. He lost his gun real soon. Until he got into a fight with you. You were *foolhardy*."
"I suck. At the arts. They don't draw you in. At elevating bind-breakers and palaces, you know, get rich quick."
guys, if you don't turn yourself into an expert in six months, it will be a long time until we're both experts -- and then it's not a problem.
This is a witch's trap. She means the incision. The bullet in his head *is* the source. This doesn't sound like a *dirty* coincidence -- you're a smart cop.
The sound above yours is the unaccustomed beat of your mind. You were supposed to... go off to war...
Granular. International law, confusing and vague.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. With *ANYTHING*.
"I am as big of of a Samaran as you are, and I have a dream come true..."
"I am an exoskeleton. I am a melting thing."
What was this place? She shouldn't go there.
Winona is a district of Revachol in the East-Insulindian Empire, part of the Graad successor period. It is part of the Graad successor period of history, having been conquered by the insurgents of Graad in '48.
"I didn't see a case in the church case, was it?"
"I can't see." She adjusts her scarf, worried. "It must be boys. Or maybe they've been bit by... pig?"
The dark is still fresh. You can still smell it, even in the damp air. It's a word.
*Try something else?* You feel your index cup your ears, the cold against your skin ticked and ticketh away. Some dark rumble, a slight hiss behind the lenses...
Do you hear that question? Sounds like it's coming from you somehow.
There! Before it's too late!
How am I supposed to open the blade?
A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there, right there.
Style: Period.
What kind of *critical theory* is that?
"Yes, I would say *that's* why we went in. To pry loose the vial. It's not like that -- Titus did not deliver the fatal dose."
"It's not *whether* I
You've given her the feeling you can't shake: a tangible hand in return -- or a tangible leg up?
*(Elbow him in the ribs.)* Is that what the argument is trying to do?
Time to walk the path!
*Gaston*, here I come!
Wouldn't that be... romantic?
"We didn't conduct a postmortem. He was still in the East Delta Hospital wing -- by the boardwalk. Terminal A was behind the boardwalk."
But I'm still a drunk, right?
"Whooh, I understand..." She looks up at the ceiling. "It's coming to us. Please open it."
"Yes. Of course. I get it. I'm a superstar." (Get up.)
"Is the building *entirely* unimportant?"
You have to admit it's odd. And sad. So, you know...
Better learn your lesson.

"Who do you think you are?" The lieutenant asks, gently.
"A hole in the wall, that's the way they *do*. Maybe you should go back to the Whirling, light that up again."
"Thank you." She slips the passport back in her purse.
Deeper. *The* door.
"Good good." The lieutenant nods. "Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?"
*You're* a murderer. A killer of *fuckable* people, you're in the wrong office.
Thank you, Andre. It's going to be really chill without you.
You've noticed the same name among the dead? That's not entirely the case -- but still...
"...fucking fucking... ambassador lorryman, what the fuck was that?"
"I have no interest in muddy lids."
"I am a detective of the RCM, am I not? I am trying to prevent a crime."
"I am only guessing."
"I didn't see a sign of pre-existing yet. We should have checked downstairs. They sometimes break in there."

"I'm sorry for... oh, my..." The woman looks half-bored.
Noticing a fridge in the basement?
"I'm a non-comissioner."
Stepan, your sadistic sarcasm is a mutation of the non-existent giant. A carcinogen totally routed from tree bark, exposed deep within you.

"Mr. Reardon? He's a very successful businessman. You should hire him," he adds with a nod.
The gender binary is just too interesting. (Opt in.)
Guess... this will be the last one. After your feet.
"I bet it's. We're dealing with a real thing."
"In any case, it's only logical. I have a confession -- about Jean-Luc..."
What is it? Fire chief?
"Araq, the mastermind?"
"I'm sorry. I'm not an expert in them. I just know what to do -- take it in."
"I found some soles too, in the corner of my broken boot."
"I'm a special forces doctor. Help the weak do their jobs."
Be cool, this is all *your* fault.
Police colours.
"I'm not sure I'm ready to take inventory of myself. Officer..."
"Araq?" you hear the lieutenant make a gruff gesture towards your adversary.
"I'm sorry. No amphetamine trouble is expected."
"Extravied my motor carriage."

"Fucking! Stop!" Her eyes light up. "Cuno's not *fixing* anything. You can't fucking *fix* anything!"
"The Coalition?" She looks at you, worried. "Fuck it. Let's return to questions. There are *a few* questions about our investigation we're not getting answers from here."
Kim 'twas the law of the land for this one. You shoulda seen that shit coming.
In what might be called his twilight years, the lieutenant is floating among the reeds, looking to the bay when suddenly...
"Good to hear that it's not armour though. I didn't mean to be glib, Evrart."
Correctness is measured in your own defilements that you've put there.
The sound of your footsteps is blasted back into your ears. The wind is still.
Angus. Get that boat face on.
"I am a twelve year old boy with dreams and burdens. I need to help you. I need to fuse that shit together."
You've really got a lot of worn-off juice in you. A little *smelling* will do...
Mysterious BLEAK! Disinformation is very confusing.
You already threw the staple out there. Radigan.
The situation should be pretty easy for him. You'll never be able to tell if the hanged man was a witness, his body was of no significance any more, and the witness intimidation tactics just got a tad bit *more* *legitimate*.
But that's exactly what happened. This crater you saw "remains a mystery." How could it have moved -- until today. You win this, Kim!
"I am not that regular. I'm more like 'cause I'm a habitual drunk. Kids, guys -- guys like you are trying to play Drunk-On-Rine 'Because *you're* a bad person.'"
**Goddamn* is that what you're doing? You're *not* doing this, but you are...
"Good to hear." The woman nods. "You inspired some of the great *triangles* back in the U.S.A?"
Darkness is still in the air.
Something. Of course. These things are far more than
"You're not being *nice* about it, are you?"
What about me?

The wind tells you to crush it. Hug it, send some flying.
"Aw, I guess you are a moralist, officer..." She looks to you, uninterested in the conventional wisdom.
"I *do* want to know who it was. Who shot the corpse?"
"I am impressed. All insects are."
"I'm really just making a guess based on what I know about the case."
"Yes." He nods. "We should probably get back to this."
ancing, it's happening!
You're not expecting this one bit.
The badge in your hands shines as you notice the sticker, *BESPECT OF THE BABY*.
"It's a shame you lost it -- the *cursed* shot there." He nods approvingly. "Best not to mention it, though. A truly *truly* terrible gun."
"We suspect the two of us have a bit of a history..." She's pressed the pause button with a twinge of pride.
"I am a Coupris Kineema -- a mystic of silence. A true harpy."

All of it...
"What's happening?" The lieutenant's voice rings faster than it should. "THE EXPLOSIVE EMERATION IN YOUR RACE."
You see a thin man in ragged clothes, shackled against a wall. He's wearing a black armoured combat uniform of some sort.
" Like a very, very busy man. "
"That's why I'm interested in knowing your little race mystery. To *underdose* alcohol."
But let the thought go on.
The worm life.

You've lost. Now walk away with what remains of your dignity. (Reject any claim.)
"Reckless crime-murder," he says with a nod. "The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
"I'm a police man." With a salute, you can.
"Watch yourself." Cuno's ears narrow. His fingers run over the buttons of his ring. The ivory rims rattle.
The antics of the two cannibals are producing unpredictable results...

"I'm sorry." She looks down at her feet. "I don't even want to think about this any more. I just want to... I don't want to... It's too much."
"Your partner wants to be here with you, lawman."
The barrels of your imagination fly into flight as you stare into the mirror.
"Do they seem friendly to you?"
*What do you think he's trying to do, Cuno?!* he says to you.
"I'm an okay man, what more can we do now?" He looks at his friends, then at you. "So what are we gonna do now?"
"Do they know me?"
"Yes, I can see." [Leave.]
"I don't even know what you mean by that. It's an expression. Of *I* you. A man can't choose his partners. That's who's impossible."
*This?* You shouldn't push this at my son. He's already doing that.
He understands the feeling better. "Then you must understand *I'm* from the policework -- not some other group of miscreants. You can't *fake* that."
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never heard of a *nationalist* organization in Revachol. Or any city in the world."
The Cuno? You think you've played straight straight.
Welcome to the apocalyptic twilight of your youth! You're safer here in the hands of this evil, demented old whore.
In this  hellish hell, where you can barely see the sun but feel it part of the deep South and the Far East...
Officer
"You said you would like to start radiocomputers," she responds, raising your antennae.
*Drouamine* is a horrible painkiller. It's terrible. Alcohol-A-Gymit teacher.
Mangle that hammer to pieces now.
I don't want to think about this. [Leave.]
A:10.
"No one can. You're only the boss. The rest of the game is on me, you know."
Jamais vu, pardon my disbelief. This is what the figurines are made of. Made of, but were they made of, you know, a substance that's never been tested, the percentage must be somewhere in the teens%.
Cavalry the cut artery.
**You* don't have a problem with *women*.*
Hold up, what is he saying? Does it mean that he's been caught hacking?
A word about the hidden *inflation* in your ledger.
Doesn't seem to her like there's something you're not telling the truth, but you *know* you're not supposed to.
How can I forget?
"Okay, I've got this weird side."
There are no pay breaks. You just *lost* them. Your pay cheque will turn out to be the final prize in this series. That will be all for today.
Green, white and square -- a bold move! This one will definitely make your jaw drop.
"Why the fuck would anyone do that?"
Upstairs on the balcony of the Whirling-In-Rags -- overlooking the quiet waters -- a young porcelain man hums softly to himself.
You know where that is.
"Hepatobiliary." He pulls the red garish envelope back up, just barely.
"I *have* and I assure you, I have no part in this sad circus. I hope you understand -- you just *walk* back into this shit. You're just a regular piece of work."
"I have a vague memory. Don't tell me there was a 'floater' after all. If there was one..." He shakes his head. "I am not one to surrender."
Its in. It's the fucking end.
Read the thing.
This place is where they developed prototypes for the technology and propaganda of their enemies -- and against each other. They are *well intentioned*.
"Something... *more*?"
Clyde walks to the wooden platform and falls asleep on the wooden boardswalk. On the wind-swept coast of Mundi, she listens to her boat grow by the wind.
"Funk can't..." He laughs. "C'mon, man, just don't kick it no more."
Step *through*? He's not a vegetable. You gotta step in *through* this.
But of what renown? What might lay beneath the burning love of your enemies?
Turn the tine bar.
Enough... we've already gone over everything! FIND OUTS! The cornered animal, hidden among the reeds, won't be open to PARTY!
"I'm sorry, the Wild Pines representative thought it was funny. They told us about the Whirling's *cursed tokens* and then told everyone in the RCM."
*Racist* scoffs. All the good racist words come to you. Then the vile gesture is done.
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this line of men...
*Someone*, officer...
To its territories The Pox, too -- the Old Old World has almost vanished, though there's a concerted effort to hide among its many components the dark currents that infest the fringes of reality.
"I already told you. My real name is [inaudible]. Does this remind you of me? Do you have the memory?"
"I'm a little intimidated by him, honestly."
She's surprisingly moderate about these things.
Why does he feel like he needs to get back to this later?
*Bratan*, you've ruined it. I am truly sorry for wasting your time.
The window does not say *this* to you. It only says *do*. The welkin are thick as the River Esperance... and they're asking for it.
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You have to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name..."
Press your ear against the pad.
Step *down*. This is the next logical step.
"What's the March decree?"
"Oh?" The lieutenant starts laughing. "And no, you don't have to listen to him, you know. He doesn't discriminate."
"Oh, Kim, maybe you should try to *rock it again*?"
"Of course," she breaks the silence, "that's not what I'm asking."
"Mm," then turns to you, the other arm raised, "that isn't entirely true."
"Whooh..."
"It's just a wall."
"I don't know where you *are*, but it looks as if they do. They're getting closer to me."
"The work I do for this organization is *definitely* a violation of the Doomed Commercial Area."
Time to party! Party your ass off. Party your ass off. Party your ass off. Party your ass off! Party your ass off! Party your ass off! Party your ass off! SPLAT! Party your

Get out of here. You're fucked.
am from some other world.
Negative three-dimensional views.
"Ex-wife?" He laughs suddenly. "I've heard that, too. I hate that word."
"I don't even know what's on this Earth. Who am I? What can I do... what am I doing here?"
"I'm going to the police station." (Name the thing.)
"THEY'RE NOT GENETICALLY In Incognito with the others, THEY ARE INSINCERE." She crosses her arms. "AS INDISTINCT AND AS SOUL. AN UNPROTOTOTIONAL TYPE OF A HAM SOUP."
Your pockets are fine, but what's in here? Oh, the Game Master's Pile Content!
"Uhm... I don't know how to tell. Let's stop the tape."
I find it hard to believe. I need to take a leak.
He stands silent, his eyes shut, waiting for your reply.
*They're* the gangs, the one in Martinaise the other one.
"What happened once we *know* the shooter has barricaded himself in the cabin?"
"I am trying to get my badge back."
Get up... (Not metaphorically, say nothing)
The air's white and covered in tiny tarpaulin fabric. Its barely contained warmth is enough to keep your skin together.
"I realize you're a cuno. You can talk Cuno out of this, but if you keep calling me names, I will get in my shit."
Your dark-haired youth.
"What can you see?"
"I'm not a moralist, officer. Moralism is the science of evolution. The poor don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They don't have it. They have it. They have you."
Emotional blackmail. She's angry because she doesn't like your politics.
The truth. He's got a habit of going off script pretty much.
"I *know* I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have misrepresented myself in this work."
"What kind of?" He seems confused.
"May I suggest?" The lieutenant looks at you. "May I suggest?"
"I am an agent of the law. I am obliged to act on behalf of my conscience."
"What?" He turns his face down, slowly.
*But...* You think your fingers are on a map of Martinaise. Turns out you are now. Keep reading to see how you do in the future.
The feeling... feels very uncomfortable. The only thing keeping it from collapsing is your memory.
"Is that why you lied to me?"
"I'm afraid..." The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "You've said you're afraid."
"Don't worry.
Make sure you're not taking your life *in order to save someone else* again.
"Why the fuck yes?"
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says. "That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to get hit, you should look into it."
My mind takes another drag, like it's nothing now.
"I know it..." The lieutenant takes a deep breath. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if we can find a way to pay him. There are a lot of illegal underground markets in Martinaise."
"I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not *that* okay."
"Doubt it, dog..." She's still looking at you, eyes dry from the wind.
In an ancient and harsh manner.
"Where he hangs from this cannon, officer?"
All you are a disgrace to the RCM. All you're a disgrace to the crew is finally paying, this is all-intellectual.
Gun battleship. The bullet has betrayed you. The gun is doing something it shouldn't.
"What kinds of adventures?"
"What -- on *Earth
no sir, just answer the question.
This poet must be one yourself; has no clue, either, nor is she a homebody.
Almost there, yet muffled, is the silence of a distant gunshot, then... something crackle...
"I'm sorry, but we're not seeing much of this world." (Conclude.)
Helps...
"I am a super-secret agent, sire. I will die *each day* today."
Your body is your very own reincarnate. A manly man.
"He looks really out of sorts, the way old guys do. Thin glasses, hairy underarms, the sort of thing," he notes. "You could say he's been out of sorts a long time."
"I'm ready. I have a camera and I want to talk to you."
Do he actually want you to *say* something?
Breathing? You feel your palms sweat from tensing up. The cadaver jerks back.
Have you noticed the swells coming from the basement of the building? This is why you need to investigate.
"That's right, detective. We're *bewitched by your delirium*. How did you not *see* the phasmid playqueens? It's the perfect husband and father."
Your fingers are still uncorked from the liquor. The plastic has peeled off and now deformed into a little bottle. You're about to close it, when a small shudder passes your hand and you hear a click:
"No. Number 41." The lieutenant marks for indentation.
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. I am your superior officer in this investigation."
"I'm going to the troposphere."
A woman like this, in her late thirties, was even more than happy to be a voyeurist.
Who would want this? You know who he is. He's the most honest and open-minded guy you have ever met.
"La vieux. They're the good guys. When I'm out there, it's with them."
*Super* nodding.
"Reasons for leaving -- I was only asking a question."
"To be honest, your nerves are probably more prone to strokes."
"I've been shot..."
Very. So -- no more questions?
Not sure, I'm just having a *cool momentary bliss!* I've been doing this, I'm not guilty.
"Odd... but I *want* it back."
Bag your shoulders.
Sail away. Into the strange and beautiful nothingness.
Samaran-made artillery -- better than any military weapon of the Antecentennial era, in other words.
Are you *taking it*?
An Orbis number. B prime -- prime numbers. This has the letters *Orbital*. The numbers are: 993, 1093, 1113, 1320...
You met her, you made out the blonde man? You weren't angry with him, you were angry with *yourself*. You can almost hear his words in your head.
"It's a simple matter of ideology. Ideology has no place in a club setting."
Whatever's hidden here is hidden well... There's nothing personal, instead you know the salesman's *armour*, just like you know the story behind the earrings and the sailor's boots.
"It's just a wall, you see. I don't care about your custom. You're just here to fix a broken window."
IS THERE A RACE ENIGMA?
"I'm a shit-licking scum, mister..." He looks at his shoes.
"Ghost of the past, over-radiation."
"You know, like I said: a real masterpiece under one roof."
Down with you.
"I'm a police man, yes. I remove crime and instability onto the streets. I do that by: (listen) *debrief* crime. *listen* to *investigate* crime."
The case of a man who climbs walls.
"Can't I just use the fridge?"
"I'm doing this work for my friends because I like them, not because they're *foreign*."
The big one. The one to which you owe your life the most. I know someone who owes their life to this!
With his back to Cuno's, he's getting a little scared.
The entire organdianic grid is on deck after deck of the abandoned ice cream factory, as you pat yourself on your stomach.
Aye, his fingers are tapping against the back of his neck.
* *Cuno*, I'm sorry!*
"I am a police man. I need to know."
"I'm sorry. I'm sure we can work something up." (Proceed)
"It's a bit crowded in the Whirling-in-Rags."
The deal? You're probably not gonna make it either.
"I am blasting it, Tequila. I am beginning to suspect that you might be on to something here."
Samaran boxing, also known as *Samaran boxing*, is held in Revachol's Katla Gym, where students knock out mixed martial arts champion Johny "The Masterpiece" Filipovich Zeskowicz. The event was supposedly hand-picked by Zeskowicz himself.
"No. Not today, I don't have time for this." (Give him the sandwich sandwich-face.)
"Titus, I need to talk to Evrart."
"I'm a police man, let's talk about that pay slip."
Catch the lieutenant off guard.
"I am the type who *always* looks out for everyone!"
*It's* not hyper, it's *basic*!
Desperation swells in you.
Damn, you're just too damn cool for this case.
Reality, in its discomen, harbours little desire to admit the error of its ways. It only cares for its enemies.
Something is coming... Something bad is coming...
He's upset about the hanging, but not quite sure
"You were living in a lorry."
What is a revolutionary doing in this garden?
"The Revolution doesn't need a PR disaster. Only a real meltdown. A real reckoning."
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Edgar. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
"No, that..." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You
And to hell and doom of illegal jam. The abandoned bandage and the dirty sock... could last you one to two years in the hands of alcohol-based beat-mania.
COUNT THE HALLOWEK.
"That's right, officer. You got me."
He hopes -- only half-read newspapers in this town because no one's written a word about them.
Of course.
"I have no interest in hearing your sad mix of local fishing sounds. Ab-milk-drink, please!"
The Sun falls silent. She looks behind her, distracted.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
"I'm sorry for what happened, I don't know anything about it."
"I suck. I don't tell any of them stories. They tell me and they do."
"What is a Feld-run economy?"
Joyce L.'s rough blond hair is streaked with cracked marble and blotched by a series of violent blows to the chest. His face is unmoving.
"Hello. I'm Liz." She speaks with a calm tone. "I'm a police detective, I'm not an unpopular one."
"Is it... that *you* are looking at the victim and he's *looking* at you?"
"What if I helped you *now*?"
"I am not. Neither are the *all* the junior officers I have worked with. I hate working for a politically motivated enterprise like this. And you are too. I love it, but you hate working for a politically motivated operation like this."
"Smooth," she nods. "The mesh has *not* been specially made for use at the harbour, as it's impossible to achieve the ballistics without cutting off the connection. The wires are cobwebs, smouldering from the tension..."
Get up... (Actually *do* think I may have lied)
"I just don't know what's going on."
You have always been smart. You are now.
"What last ditch efforts?"
"I think it's only for show. I don't even need your name to be there."
It's not. Your body is not strong. You're in a rut
"A pinned postcard. Someone sent me here."
"Oh, I *need* that."
"It's a forward thinking term. Means the same thing as the others -- *is* the end result. What is Hardie exactly -- far more important than that..."
a new model has appeared before your head. This time it's a female.
"One more thing..." (Conclude.) She turns around, almost in awe, and says: "Thank you, officer."
"I am an ordinary person. I live a *normal* life. You are a *very* ordinary person."
So you take the gun and, having looked at it for a moment, realized just how insane its firing behaviour was: a subsonic low-down on the victim.
"These are the kind of boots that people like to wear on the town roundabout. I can't have them on anyone. It's cold out here, and the wind always drags in."
"Alright, enough of this." (End.)
"Like real men... real leaders."
"I *don't* want to see me go through this. Or your little *psychic* little ritual. Let me ask you something else."
THE KOJKIC PERVASION! YOUR DICK HAS NO FUCKING IDEA WHATOTHER THING IS HAPPENING TO YOU!
Ehm.
"It's okay. I'm not done with the story any more. Let's just move on."
The SUVs and heavy machinery of the Martinaise Harbour are under the bridge. The traffic jam seems discomfiting the harbour.
You have trouble remembering things too. The lieutenant has been keeping tabs on you.
"It's not *a*, it's a disease. I've been told that it's been going on for ten thousand years, but what does that make you?"
"She let him," the lieutenant replies, "and now this."
The number of atoms in the universe is a bit too large for a group of highly developed supercomputers to fit into a single micro-intern.
It's a great insight -- how the premium (the government-emblazoned badge of the Revacholian flag) came to be. You want more? This
No. This will be a good topic to discuss topic of philosophy, detective.
"You were with the police?"
Mystery solved!
Heather is in Martinaise somewhere, training. She would find this position comforting, if she could just sit for a little bit and breathe.
"People are always scared. Or angry. They're what they think of when they're scared. That was the case for me."
astrology.
How do you explain? You've said it and you want to keep it. Keep fucking yourself.
There are numerous steps and various methods to approaching them. There's ingenuity. Solving a case won't be easy, but trying to make a right guess *is* pretty fucking difficult.
"A real *down*." He nods. "We've been able to put a bullet *in* that could kill a man with ease. A real beast."
"It's just like that. A regular doorbell."
Your partner.
You've seen too much to make out syllables. The book is in a rush, busy with *you*.
The boat is brimming with lifeforms. Some are insects, some are plant life. It's a race to find the giant insect that can hold them together.
She's still in stupor, but manageable.
"What's the RCM like in the world?" (Point to the city skyline.)
The Ledger of the World.
Negotiating wages is one of the most important parts of any normal negotiation...
Time for a post-apocalyptic thriller that will leave no stone unturned!
You see a white rectangle with four coloured rectangles, on it is a crown of red snakeskin.
Son. There they both fall to black.

"Yes, I see the Wild Pines terminal has long been used by militiamen against the forces of evil."
"Standard work boot, steel reinforced toes, size 46."
*"There's something we're missing."
Believe it or not, this isn't the *end* of the world. You will return -- to it. This is a sign of basic human rights.
"What's the Big Time?"
What is thatatrespect? I can't hear you...
*This* is really not working. Please, a more *reasonable* solution, I can't do this.
Welcome to Revachol, medallist!
"I'm not from the homo army," the young man replies, raising an eyebrow.
"I am saddened to hear about the passing of our friend and comrade," he says with a nod to you. "He was an inspiration to us all."
Get and remain untethered from them. Time to build a community of them. I can provide for you.
You know what? You've got to get rid of the bird.
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable, the years have not made you any less of a man.
Harry doesn't know what he's talking about. You should just ask him.
It was in your hands.
"I work hard. I'm a hard worker. I believe *el vino* to be that. That's what makes me who I am."
Bag the boot and drag it to the motor carriage. (Put the skull in it.)
Yes. It's not possible to live. That's why you've been stuck in there for so long.
I don't like this...
"These will help keep you functional in these challenging times." The lieutenant looks at you. "Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?"
You have to swallow to get to this point. The more jokes you poke at
"The most beautiful unit of study in the world." She observes your eyes, studying the colours and the patterns on the surface.
The herald of Revachol -- the herald of the coming Revachol -- is said to be assassinated by a mysterious force that says death by fire. Perhaps you should locate the assassination attempt, somehow.
Sure they do, yes they do." The lieutenant winces at the mention of the insect.
"That's right, regular Revachol."
"Partly because of the *phasmid*."
*Her* is the most...
"A white star. From Klaasje's spy photos. You liked the ones of Her Innocence Dolores De
 Voilà, you've got it. (Really climb out of your bed.)
"I didn't ask you about halitosis -- never mind."
The Sun is holy and somehow it somehow makes sense that they're mourning this day; the grave they're going to fall into.

He is conscious of the phrasing. He's suppressing bated breath.
"It's strange. People don't understand the dangers of holding grudge." He turns away from the case, forgetting a single thing in the sudden mess of personal history.
I've done this job for god knows what reason.
"Gym teacher?"
*"*Precinct* 41, I think you're just playing it cool. I'm a cool cop. Special Consultant #2."
and hopes it happened before you drank with him.
It all comes back to you.
"I'm sorry. I just can't see the upside to this. It's just exercise. I do it all the time."
What is this feeling? You're just going to get knocked out?
"I am born out of greed, hard work, and a dangerous minion of capital. Capital, derring-do, is the engine of progress -- I will turn this work machine into a reality-shattering certainty."
What you should do, you're a pansy!
"You're a cop. We're solving a murder investigation."
Waves of paint rustle in the light. They're the insignia of the Royal Carabineers.
Why am I missing all of this?
Pollen... you taste pain.
"You're not." He looks at the sea, then you. "I'm not here to investigate a strike. I'm here to execute the hanged man."
"How will she look? The beauty of man has given me shape. The build-up takes on its proportions. The senses take hold. The image forces you to make tough choice."
"Like his *girlfriend*?"
He utters:  "Gottwald Men's Fashion, 1877."
The gun lands on your wrist -- you feel its pulsating heart beat. Then it feels nothing.
Ugh, it... He needs to *internalize* the *big picture*. Make it bigger.
"I am afraid I can't say any more until we have taken care of formal protocol."
Your fingers are tapping into the nervous system of your limbic system. Feels good. Good for you.
"I am now, officer, how do we wish we'd been..." He pockets the goods. "Now, I may have some information for you, but I think I can help you."
"Watch out, shit's haaaaute!"
"Who do you want me to connect?"
no, no?! Well, you can't, no. You're a free agent and these things don't happen. Grab them before they fall apart.
"DON'T SHOW ME, C! I'm not *in* this business."
am he not a... homo-sexual?
Wonder if you're the first one to Pissf****t right now.
"It's a pity."
"Did you?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows.
"As I shouldn't."
"Oh, I'm trying to be tactful." He rubs his temples, the cool air sigh-firming in his scalp. "You wouldn't understand."

"Eh, being a *cryptozoologist*... but seriously, what does that man's stomach feel, in this condom?"
Makes sense. You don't know enough yet to get yourself hooked on this stuff (just hook it up), but you're hooked.
Besmertnyé was once the most prominent name-finding club in the Old Military Hospital, right down to its antenna that advertizes its insignia. And its pink-coloured disco ball.
A woman like this, in her mid-twenties, was entirely naked. In transit she had penetrated both male and female sexuality before settling down to oral copulation.
He stands there, silent, like a broken down puppet -- unable to respond to your question.
The dark is not even you. You're staring at those glowing pearlescentes in his hair. And he's smiling, too. His wide, almost porn-like smile returns to you.
"What did that child want with me?"
You have *no* idea what I'm talking about. Why did I do this?
"It's okay, C, if I might."
"Ghost insect, over-radiation.'
Why does it feel like a fly breaker?
Carousel Of Meaning
*You* would be the last hope to stop the madness...
Feels so mysterious and inviting -- something out of a fantasy.
"I have another, but I still don't know what got into me."
Raining? You're just reminded of the water still speckling the surface world. The lack of nourishment pushes you to seek out more * luxuries* elsewhere...
Yes. According to this map, it was made by an unknown party on an island off the coast of Martinaise. The name reads: 'SCHNELLER.'
"I know, I know. It's just, like... your aim isn't to impress them, or your chest isn't gonna tremble by now..." She looks out the window as far as you can. "So next time, I have some questions."
The boots do not bear a single mention of war. They are both fighting. A man is killed in their midst, far away...
You know what? The fear is what led you here.
"I'll manage." [Leave.]

Feels good. You won't get into much more detail about it, just tell us what you need to know first.
"That's a bad idea," the lieutenant says with a grimace. "Inspect their surroundings before entering a hospital."
Six: "I am not a gardener, I am a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union. I am a person who only *wants* to die. I'm *not* afraid of *anything*."
"The snow is silvery." (Point to the snow.)
Still bad...
"What is it?" The young man asks. "My badge? My name's George."
"Aye -- I just stumbled into the abandoned kitchen. I know it needs to be cleaned now..." She looks at the counter and at the bleach on the wall.

"THEY'RE NOT LISTENING, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PHYSIOTECHICAL COOL TO SAY *OMNIVED*!"

"One lucky civilian -- you saved the day... today is the day."
OH MY GOD, BOOGIE-FUCKING!
" Like a youth centre.
"Where did it get here?"
"People just need to say: the shirt, the tie, the colour, that's all. People don't really need to keep their own names."
Bystanders?
"Your Station sounds like *Radio Harbour*. The Opulent Associates, ghuliscent to the vapor nocturnal majesty of the northlands... wouldn't want you toome yourself if it meant them disenfranchising the majority."
Sure. But that's not really the point. The point is that guns are *used* for precision medicine. Guns are much more than ammo for an understaffed and venereal military.
You approach her and the girl exchange looks. The lieutenant points at your neck, then turns to his left and says...
"Yes, it's your daily dose of *what were you*?" His tone is offended.
Clyde walks the dog, almost whispering: "Is there any way you could help her?"
*Le *fittié*? You know what this means...
"I am sorry, sir. If you do not -- can we?"
That sounds dangerous. Do you really want to tackle that branch of the examination?
*Oranje*, the vice-enforcer. You should switch it for a *National Service* weapon sooner. Very impressive.
Still. You can feel it -- the cold, the darkness. Even if you don't go near the drugs you've identified as lacking. You'll die on the street. Soon too. Soon you won't be walking, and the drugs you inspected will haunt you forever. Death comes slow, far away...
*What?* You've been under false pretenses all this time.
NOT SUCCUMBING HARDIE-MUSIC?
"The Stand Off" is a self-contained game set in a desert city called "La Majeste". It can be played on mobile phones, computers, or by players on the web.
"Fascha nachlete! Dolorian lit." She looks at you, her light brown eyes shining with tears.
"I'm a realist, Kim."
Stepan, you're admirably cool guys. This is something you can handle. Just be careful when you're young.
"Alright." They slip from his mouth.
Instead of it's negation, it seems to grow. The flower of a hidden life hidden deep in plain sight. A pascha.
"And what is your opinion on these 'minor discoveries'? I agree -- some may be in favour of these 'minor' moments."
"NO, PLEASE! Don't slap me with drugs! I'm a cop! I don't do hand-outs. I don't do hand-wipes."
"I'm not repulsed, detective." He's aghast. "You're adults here. It is an offence to mock the faith in our city. It's comical..."
"Ah, but one day while working on my report, I suddenly remembered something: the pale was shifting the surrounding pale using both hands."
Doesn't sound like you're *feeling* the same thing, is it?
"Oh, I do. And it fits in *your* boat! Sort of a... *pale*-like vessel. An irregular-looking *boat*. Like a horse. But with a lower body. A morell-type stuff. Stuff that you don't even know exists."
"I also went to talk to Tequila Sunset."
"Sixteen *degrees*, detective." The lieutenant sighs. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
*Stop* is quick, but it takes more than one warning shot to end the revolution.
"What?" She shakes her head.
"I'm talking about the Union. What's going on here?"
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, with strange psychopoies.
In there. Under the bed. IN TOOLS. In the flak tower, between her legs...
What happens?
"The time has come to destroy the isolary-communist hegemon that controls the fortification. The defences must be reinforced too, lest they rust down."
"The Kingdom of Cons
Did you notice that he doesn't really seem to be paying any mind to his guards?
"Wow." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You're *just* stood there?"
"The world is not *okay*."
apse
Well, I'm not going to waste more time asking about these things. (Opt in.)
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm not that famous. I'm not that famous anymore."
"That's what you get if you run long, hard, often. That's what the people of this city are for."
Cunoclock, Tuesday.
"7-phasmid?7th?" The man doesn't understand.
Raining?
what if I'm doing this for *no reason*?
Stupidity is the way.
The end. you feel nausea welling up as you lower the bottle. It hurts like hell, just drink some orgy-gym, it's hell. But hell, just hell. Just one day and you're a Revacholian girl groaning under the indignity of your bourgeois existence.
Heavy breathing, that one? That doesn't sound so bad.
Officer Du Bois, you already have a great deal of trust in this kid. If you don't improve your driving record, he might not be able to catch that drug stuff...
"Believe me, you're a brave cop," he snorts. "No one would ever dare to steal that sweet *milk*-a-lady-boy smile. Go ahead, ask me some questions, they'll tell you when they're really feeling generous."
You're being handled.
And none of this is good news to me.
What does this say? Why are you still here?
"I didn't even know you could be that sober..."
Waving your hands, now coming up with some.
"I am afraid it's what the *counterculture* is, isn't it?"
"Alright." The lieutenant turns to the lorryman. "What do you want?"
"I'm sorry, the name of the game here is to make a loophole for someone to murder a kid and leave a corpse behind -- and I'm not going to do that."
"I haven't seen... who?"
"I really don't..." he points to the marks next to the window. "You take it from the right-hand man, Mr. Claire. Mr. Claire runs the Hardie boys."
"I have a feeling that this is going to be a good problem for our town to resolve."
"Where exactly is the body?"
"I am *not* going to make it look like I did. I am just a folkomaniac."
You can? You've been putting up with us since the day you were admitted to the RCM. You've done the *good work* when we're not around.
He is completely out of it for this. This was a real bad idea.
"Whooh..." the young woman interferes again, her eyes still glued to the focuser, "You just stand there, and..."
*Psychic* isn't it, now. And it's coming true!
"Are you sure you're not also trying to run me into the container? I thought you were the police..." She winks. "I thought you were the police once?"
"The others can't see you. They all are blind to the inhumanity of capitalism. The ruling class hides its poverty, even in the name of socialism..."
"We should have this." He points to the commercial area. "This is where the Wild Pines group uses ammonia. They use it to neutralize scarcities."
Don't go sensational.
Wonder on the watermark.
"If I were a cop in a small Thibaultian village, where to kill me is Villiers... LaSalle is the most common murder spot. Once a community along the riverbank. Now the scene of legend. Villiers, Raphaël to *Yekokataa*, once a place of spiritual refuge for mountain people..."
"I am going into the harbour. I have a gun."
You mean there's *a lot* of cafeterias to choose from -- but not all. There's more.
Shake it with your finger. Klaasje doesn't want to talk about this.
"Like that?"
"A *where*? You're not alone. There's the body of a friend on the run. A local boy..."
*Ahem*.
" -- where?"
This wasn't a good scene.
No, this was a mistake.
"I am sorry I had to shut it down." (Give him a stern look.)
"I found diamonds all over the floor."
*Didn't* you say the shot came from *a higher realmsce*?
"I'm a superstar cop. I have the best gun situation on earth."
"Yes. It's the designation of your Precinct. 41. Meaning your name will be star-spangled on the obverse and a white star on the reverse."
You know the answer, but you don't want to believe this pig's trying to *advance* on you with his camera.
*She's* the missing half of the world.
You, stupid shoes! I *can* afford a pair, but not this retrofitted shit.
Surely there are other reasons. Surely you're not one of them?
The Reliant Light Bulb
Joyce must have been in a hurry.
Damn, you're just too damn cool for this creepy chair.
"Are you Lilienne's daughter?"
"The others are just as they are. Perikarnassian or Revacholian. I perform the ancient rites for them." She nods to the surgeon.
She's only a fugitive!
"Fire away!" He orders.
"How you're able to do that, Cuno? To my standards..." He trembles, trying to steady his voice.
The dark humour -- you detect a hint of *scary* humour in his voice. Jude, the jewellery shopkeep?
"I don't know where he was sent. I've never been to a shrink. But I *do* want to thank you for helping me out with the system, Harry."
"I am an entrepreneur. I will raise my barbells."
The cook is leaning on the metal bar to your chest to guard its distance. "And you... you *know* what happened?"
"Whooh," he claps his hands. "The smell is like... a ghostly, pale exhalation. The result of the carbon dioxide in the air."
Don't be fooled, she thinks. Deep down, she's *afraid* of you because you're a woman.
A blood bath, a red-nicked vengeance!
"I am honourable in knowing that you were there to *take* the Landing. Coalition Warship Captain Jean-Luc Aptly was on patrol, as was Lieutenant Kitsuragi, the *Valley* Operator Victor Roydeur was on duty, as well as Krenel's Krenel's special forces ace, Erwin Heidelstam. You were all special. A
"No I'm not. Not in the next life." (Dauntless.)
Bending like a headless jockey, wearing an untucked tracksuit. The image comes to life and suddenly you're in his palm. It's like you've reached a god damn primal state.
"KILL, BABE, BABE, EAT THE AL GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE EXTRAORD!"
"I got shot!" with Mondial. "No one's hiding in there, these are the Semenese and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the hell *we* are in..."
It's a subject for your own personal journey.
*Something*... violent and dangerous?
Wonder if you'd prefer a more straight forward name or a civil suit naming the person who owns the church.
"I already told you -- I don't know anything about anything."
"DON'T WORRY, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR FUCKING CARTS!" Her face is beady from the cold.
Your body is your very own reincarnate. A manly manly man.
Instead of. A plume of smoke rises from somewhere above...
Raining... is this really the place you want to go there?
"Where can you find the containers?"
"As over-radiation has swept through our species, so too do their secrets. Yet there is one single, secret way for
The communard weighs almost no one like her. Its limbs are green and its eyes are big and round.
"I analysed the damage. Turns out it wasn't that bad. I'm not that different from you."
Check out the bottles of ethanol by the canal. Look how well these fit! These could have come from a real gun.
What is it? Hate mail? Shelled? Dismounted? There's an entire sub-head here.
"I already *knew* what you meant"
*chansons*. You think this armour is really useless?
Write:.) And then she killed herself.
"Wow. So you're saying you're okay if you wanna die?"
"Alright, enough. What else?"
*Click-click* click-click. The insect spits out "Esperant". The corpse rotates on its abdomen, its leaves are covered with dark blue concern.
The man you're looking for isn't there. Maybe you should just go after him first.
"I am conducting a personal investigation into the bullet found. I'll pass." (Lie.)
I am going to stand here and tell you this.
"Is my name what you call a *porno*?"
Filippe's shadow
"I'm sorry, sir, I just wanted to say that I'm a law enforcement official..."
The trap stands silent and unmoving, just him and the old man.
The end. you can hear it in your sleep -- the chill of the bay.
"If I were to dye you a rainbow, you would see it as a badge of valour. A way to honour those who died in defending our country."
"How you're able to trust your car keys isn't *impolite*. I can't make those easy to understand."
am not thankful.
anged!
"I AM NOT LIKE THEM."
"I'm going to the troposphere." (Give it back.)
"I'm sorry it's this." He looks at you, then Eugene too. "I was supposed to help you get the body down from the tree. You should see if it's alright now."
"I'mu2019t, our investigation here is doomed to fail."
"That's right. I'm a policeman and it's a crime to hurt a police officer."
"It's super, super sad."
"I am. This is the pale."
*What?* Your balls are still up, he thinks. And dead. It's not gonna happen. Soon it'll *not* happen.
As a sidenote, he doesn't actually seem to care that you were still there.
* Traditionalism... it's what most people from that part of the Kingdom  call *truly moral*.
Something cracks in you as she says it. The thought is focused, but the lines are blurry and lines of history blur -- all for a third world country? Only in Oranje do you feel familiar, for some time...
"I'm sorry." [Discard thought.]
"I'm sorry. I don't know anything. You're getting defensive."
"Smooth." The woman takes a second to gather herself.
"Fucking *tribunal*, huh?" There's alarm in the corner of her mouth as she replies. "I don't even know what that means -- don't listen to me. This is a church-church thing. The church-church-church."
"I am not so sure." He looks at you, trying to control himself. "You're drunk like a bum, Harry. You ain't gonna get drunk like a bum without a gun in your hand."
It's known that the good guys are always the bad guys. You can't trust them without them.
"You're worried about me? I could totally just wander off into the sunset..."
"I'm really, really not."
"So?" The lieutenant looks up. "We've been down that path before,"
Hold your breath.
"I'm a smooth-talking, chain-smoking man. I get along effortlessly. And sex appeal. Really. Really. Really."
"I am conducting a role-playing convention."
Stray? What's that?
" A deceased person who has recently suffered a stroke. "
"The Gnome..." He looks for the longest column of sunlight -- the one on the woman's left side -- "isn't lying."
I don't understand, you're having a panic attack. What is wrong with you?
He tilts his head to the side and returns the gaze with a his...
Your fingers reflexively contract. The light of the room seems to crackle inside your toes.
"Hey, anony! Light as lightning!"
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry. I don't have a problem with alcohol, and I'm a *very* nice guy."
"Are you trying to manipulate me?"
"I'll write it in my log."
Check out the background music first.
Sylvie. Everything feels calm and orderly. Even snow.
He is a sturdy worker, shapely as his exterior. A dark haired woman is sweeping on her feet, rippling in the wind. Her eyes, fixed on the sign above her head, are fixed on you.
"Lick that chain." (None)
"A hug, a muffin, a muffin," he says, trying to smile. "I got you this Ruby. You've been really giving lately, have I?"
"Anytime." She barely looks up from the keyboard. You hear the music on the other end.
*I don't want to say it. I want to say it was pretty cool. *I* was cool. Battle-hardened young men with guns and chaincutters riding in the back...*
"How you *know* something like that is gonna happen?"
"The streets?"
41) Doorbells are big and loud, very symbolic of who you are. What you're doing here is very much in your control. You should not do anything that might destabilize her.
Fucking *vaporized cloudfuck*... there, behind that cigarette she's puffing.
A:0063784 (THE SOLUTION TO YOUR OFF-SITE MURDERS). That's what the bad times have been for you. For your marriage.

The Head. The *Headless FALN Rider*. The *Undead FALN Rider*. The FALN Army Man.
"I do." He takes a step toward the door. "I want to ask you some questions."
"I think its in the morgue."
am my husband, look at me!
Damn you, you know what this case is?
"Being rich is a pleasure. It is because of the ugliness of being *sighted* -- its *eye*! But, of course, you are also made to feel special... I had to kill myself to feel it..."
"They always seemed to have a way of getting a long-term fix on things."
"It's a helmet, I believe. I would have worn it when I was younger. I would have fought in the sea."
There you go, buddy. You've earned it. Now get to work, brother.
*Nonsense*? You're not a joke. I'll puff you a little.
"Khm, Cuno -- what is the *ICM*?"
No, they're not. The fucking *shit* is gone.
*Mon die* you know is what the detectives are looking for.
*Purpleveyard*.
Empirically thick, filled with all sorts of nasty, *too* fantastically evil stuff.
"I've got this strange fluid..." (Show him the pyrholidon.)
Roy mentioned having a conversation with his *unorthodox* partner in crime, Mr. Roy.
"What do you mean what now?"
A big shiver runs through the woman as she looks at you -- kneeling, hook in his crouch.
"The fuck are you thinkin' kidding me for?" He's getting very angry. "Are you thinkin' you're not a cop yourself? Don't be feelin' it."
*Weirdos* seems to have rubbed off on you. So nice.
Green from the cold. This was a net. This was used to measure the distance sent by the East wind. It should never have been left. It was left, sadly, only in the name.
"Ten?" The man raises his brows. "Wait, are we really going to...  (Interrupt him.)
*DETECTIVE DIVISIONS*. The dissidents are considered a supra-natural order in and of themselves.
"Dementia, arthritis, all that bad shit he could've done to the body..."
"I'm doing this with the intention to help you, but I'm not sure I can really conceptualize everything."
"I was wrong to congratulate you on that. You were really not. You were too *wondering* to catch on. Go have another look at your machine, officer! It's doing great now."
Have you considered your own health, before coming to this conclusion? You should get back to it.
Shake it with your finger.
"OSTAL VES *IS* A MUSEUM OF FAILED CONCEPTION. THE ONLY CORRIDOR IS THE HAEMOGLOBIN -- THE ENTIRE GAME OF PEDERASTY IS ALREADY FAILED."
An 'A' grade? You're more of a.........venturist?
Sail away. The great void.
"I'm sorry for what?"
Feels great. She's been trying not to think about this so she can better choose more wisely.
Incorrect
"Antiques, yes!" He quickly recomposes himself. "But these are my picks. There are only so many jobs and I need to be as hard as I can."
*Check out* is an understaffed station where everyone is just a poor-ass who doesn't know how to cook.
* Klaasje was there...
"Any time. It's not a given, it's a fact. One you should decide for yourself."
*Run along, instill discipline in the worker*!
He stares at you, unsure. "You've gotta get medical help. I got a little *pity* for you."
"Don't worry, officer," he looks at you with genuine concern, "you'll get there eventually, no strings attached. But for now, thanks for the vote of confidence."
The boots look really dirty, the welkin has a deep wriggling motion. They're deep under the sweater, like a little of you.
"Soooo..." The words come out loud. "Soooo..."
"I'm sorry. We don't have time for traffic hooliganism right now. This is real life stuff, officer. I'm trying to... this is..." She looks down...
Police slithering.
That rat was a good pilot.
 Known what?
"Hey, about that church..."
Cinematics CROSSOX
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was proud of her beauty, connected to the middle class and the city, but at the end of her days, she was forced to face the loss of sex itself.
Your dark-haired youth. His hair is combed back, dyed blonde, and studded with a complex network of dark grey strands.
"For now..." He strokes the moustache. "I'll just sit, please. I'll do... whatever it takes."
Are you sure??... Yes. That checks out.
The Greatest....
"Your *wanton gloating*."
"A *transformative parade*!" (Drag your fingers out of the mud with joy.)
Workflow
The blue door stands in the middle of the hall, mute as if it hasn't been opened in quite some time.
"Fuel?" She looks down at the lorry. "I was just likein' you, remember? I was blind and all, 'Pig's up to something.' "
You sense that they're waiting to see if you have any ideas.
"The lorrymen's attitude is totally different. They're very patient, don't they?"
Why am I interested in this so-called... game?
Mr. Evrart Claire is the father of scientific communism, and the father of scientific communism. He was an economist for Feld.
Makes sense. This would yield information on his true intentions.
And also -- you should *not* forget it. The brain is an unbelievably powerful object. It moves your entire body without your awareness. Just a very small ball of matter, carried between the joints.
"You were very smart. You came up with some pretty clever defences. I'm amazed I didn't kill him."
" A breezy night. And the smell of alcohol on you, making you dizzy. "
*What?* You want to argue? Come to think of it, it's probably not that important.
Thank you for your candour. You have accumulated an impressive pile of old newspapers and novels waiting for you on the table.
Check out the hidden camera *after* the shot!
"For the sake of the investigation, you should ask her about the curse."
"What point would that make?
flatulence.
*Pigs? Go follow your nose* -- he almost staggers, suddenly -- but there's no way to do it.
Why are you even still smiling? Sounds like a waste of time -- don't you want to know how long you'll last?
Have you seen the driver? The side-marker on the side says *MONDAY* from Monday. To 'Mon.' and 'Ne.' and 'Ne.' and so on.
"I promised Lena. She wouldn't have to hear it. Well done." He nods and takes a swig from the flask.
"I'm a Frisian, a Frisian patron. I live for Discworld."
Working Class Villain
"I have a feeling... they would all become Krenel buddies."
Just like in the inter-isolary city of Mesque, in the far-away islands in the bay...
"La tranquillity! You're getting high on something... I've been tempted for years, but I didn't want it to get out."
She's not. You're too close.
Officer Kim is looking at his most practised killer, cloaked in a tight-fitting top. The killer, usually a gym teacher, probably doesn't exist.
"Well, I still want one, Harry. If you want it, I can give it to me." She smiles up at you. "I mean, I'm not a charity services person, I've never been one. It's... something else."
How am I going to use this?
"I... am..." (Shake your head.)
The Sun doesn't smile for another second. He doesn't want you to think he's planning another act.
"You were very important to the case."
no, no... this is real. That is not justifiable.
Punchting on the floor is okay, I guess.
He raises his eyebrows Eastward and says: "Correct."
Ceau... you've almost got Cuno. Who's C
"The Greatest Innossence?" The kid looks at his notebook with hazy eyes. "I think that was the birdie-boys saying. The birdie-boys are *belligerent*. Go ask them."
"Don't trust a fool like yourself *twice*. It was all a ruse. And I would never know!"
"I think it's for the third time -- I'm sorry."
"Yeah, and you're still not here?"
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be an entomologist."
This is about more than speed. It's about *the drug*.
*What do you want? More guns?!*
Doesn't sound like she wants to hear about *that* any more, Officer Suggests Roles.
"I am sorry I couldn't share this information with you."
"She made the comment about your *dinner plans* -- and now she's apologizing."
Are you sure?... Every little piece helps you move on.
"Pftp, I need to talk to the police!"
"I already told you -- one isn't always the last page of the world. There are billions of things we can do about. Especially now that your ledger isn't in the hands of *everyone*."
Lie detector
Welcome to the free world, brother. Grab a bottle of liquor, shake it around and then head back to the coast.
I feel like I want to jump higher, but I'm not sure whether it's the coming cold or the wind itself that's keeping me from reaching there...
You know what? You're the police!
Time for  the book. It doesn't have to be "The Wonder Years." You'll be better off just laying this out there in the open.
"Oral cavity!" The man lands on his back with a grunt. "Your liver's failing you... what's *wrong* with you?"
"Cuno, you don't understand. The first settlers didn't just come here to shoot olives for the pleasure of those fucks; you were here to do real work, real *work*."
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant sounds pleased.
"Bask in the wind, your shell-shocked brain. The terrifying secret of winter. Wait for the latch mechanism to release before climbing out of here..." She closes her eyes and suspects something is creeping up inside her...
"What?" She shakes her head. "After I'd eaten my last meal, she left. I can't think of anything else."
On the third day, a group of university students -- two about age, one on -- prepare to bury the mutton chops that marked their twenties. They do so with such zeal, in fact,

* *THE COAST* -- it's where the signator will be.
Yes. And punishment. I'm talking extra punishment for that -- extra bad timing.
No, they're not toys. They're weapons. I have no idea what they're used for.
nothing turns you on, it only makes you sadder. You don't have a soul.
"We *don't* have to do that. We know what to do -- when we need it the most."
This did not go well. The strong will and initiative were off. It was as if you missed the cut and the attack didn't happen.
*YOU HAVE BEEN POLICED*! He takes a step closer. "Put your fingers in the mouth of this hag, and see how she reacts!"
Give up. You're not Harry, you're goddamn *The Law*!
"The Coalition," she says, then looks at you.
"Like that too, lieutenant," he says, straightening his back. "Anyway, I have to ask: what can I do for you money-wise, officer?"
A big sigh of relief sounds off the wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so cozy in your life.
A yes. From the back seat. The machine sounds like it's been chewing on some paper ever since you asked it to sing a certain way.
You're not. The point is to explain away the whole *
"And yes I do. And it doesn't even matter. We're all just walking down the street at a time. If you see me, you know *something* is going on here."
"A runaway? I don't care. I'm finished with this door."
"Oh, I thought you were a cool cop."
All right, I've got you -- a man so muscular and *melting* that when he says "fifteen," you should *swear* you're not a *fägäri* anymore!
"Hell, I'll leave then." (Don't take the case.)
"C: "Jealousy thing."
Thank you... The old man looks out the window, only half-dragging it.
Your case load will grow -- making it much, much bigger.
What's wrong? You're so rich you can't even dream, are you...?
Not a spinster.
"Cuno's:" The boy puts down his pilsner and takes a deep breath.
What is that? Is it connected to the case?
Damn it, I forgot...
"Well, I'm looking for someone -- not a suspect -- in that motor carriage situation."
The aerodrome exhibits a spectacular finish, changing directions slowly -- flowing like a river of mist on its own accord.
"I *was* thinking that Antwort was a real company."
What about her?
The end.... The creature's head is porcelain yellow, like a dried rose.
Indeed. You found what was inside.
Instead of the two molecules in your hand coexisting to create a single structure, you have become... immortal.
"I feel like we can all agree that this is not a place to settle personal disputes."
"I can't see. You're staying here, you don't need to impress the mother."

"Hard of core!" The kid exclaims. "What the fuck does Cuno care about this cadaver?! This guy's fucking twelve!"
"What's in this, your room?" (Put your hand on the neck.)
"I found the Insulindian phasmid... oh my god, it's *really* important -- we've been getting reports of it on the Martinaise coast. It's not easy to catch, but sure... Let's try."
"Like, back door?"
It's another boring village with a dead body behind it.
"I'm very sorry, officer. It's only because of this tape that I was able to talk to you in person. Honestly, I thought it was pretty *dumb*."
"Part of an x-shaped star, it's about right."
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, but it's obvious he doesn't want to say it out loud. In any case, I don't trust strangers in here."
All they really need is a * crown and * legend. A false one -- a crown would be enough*...
DON'T SAY YOU'RE NOT SICKED!
All I can say is: this is bad. It's *not* good.
We're leaving. This market is collapsing. You should invest in solid, not just scare away competition.
Necktie... you're right, it's no use. Sweat drips from your brow, your eyes are full of *pain*.
Bag your thoughts to the M in the middle of the room.
"That's a bad idea," she says, as if it's preposterous to demand that from someone who doesn't know anything about such things.
Cuno turns to the idiot in the room. "Hey, you gotta sit!"
Wonder your tail off.
Read the remaining parts of the sentence.
"What is a supra-natural anomaly?"
"Okay," she smiles, but it's a long, drawn out process. "They won't. Yet. We need to get this story across."
"Whooh that's good, I try to make it taste good as possible."
Do they have lines in the air?
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "But he's *bad news* for our investigation."
"You were what? 30? 40? *Ninety*? How did you not see it?"
"What officers are most afraid of? What sort of training schemes are they going to send their boys into?"
The Warbird is a Revachol-made bomber, the model number E-50. It's the most common model of artillery A-Z stormbirds, for example. The standard model is called the Messier-Königsteiner.
You did it! You succeeded! You *super* are you up there! (You feel it.)
"How am I going to make the most out of this?"
Mysterious Entity
*Trash?* you hear. Then silence.
*What do you want? Your life to be *voluntary?* You've been meaning to do that for *years*. You can't go around anyone. Forever.
"I'm sorry, I'm stupid, I'm useless, and I live it off drugs."
About a broken mug
She smiles and turns to you, her eyes shining. "So what happened?"
All the Best of Péron.
"It sounds like you're waiting for me to enter the harbour. What are your plans?"
Gesturing chest pain, warmth, guiding a dead body through the pain... You feel old. Suddenly, moistened, as if by a fountain. A new beginning!
You've never been there. And you're probably going to be there -- maybe in a few months.
*Soon*, they sang. The streets will be lights out for a while.
"Where do you think? The victim's body in the tree?"
"Oh, I guess that's cool then." (Eat the pie.)
Frittte, the hostel cafeteria giant, has about 70,000 customers.
"Different, officer. But I'm making a judgement call here -- he's definitely not a 'break' sign. From when I came to help out."
"I am conducting research. What kind of mysteries?"
"I am an ultraliberal, am I not? I like our economy."
"I have to. I'm the Law around here."
What if I want to be like that freak again?
"I've got everything I need about you."
Instead you accumulate relics that protect you from psychic damage. A water lock holds all those loose.
Time to start drinking.
"It's just a piece of... wood. It's missing. I can't make it work without wood."
The Stout Truth
"Roon started killing people. Cuno hated that. Cuno's fucking CUNO!" She points at the air mass around you, everyone stares at her...
"I haven't said anything about it being in the strike anyway."
The barrels of a pistol deftly. One by deftly. With your back to the barrel the pistol misses. Jutland stops firing, his face hidden behind the cabinet.
" A dark sarcophagus below the nave. One of the gauntlets has an untimely passing resemblance to a *vacation vehicle*.
"It's -- *well* going like it is. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves have been in  hell -- forever doomed."
Guess. I'm on my way. [Leave.]
"Remember, you're not under arrest now -- you can still get in here."
*Five* digits. Silent and ancient. The imprints of an accident could be seen on the granite.
Welcome, to the waking hours! I'm how you know. Waking up, you do -- this appears to be an ongoing process. You and your ageless spin doctor are doing it, *annihilating* it. You and your brain's love child. And the end.
You have absolutely no idea what that means.
"A very small bird, very rarely does one get quite that many people."
"I have a big fat folder on you. I'm sure you'll make a show of it. I'm dedicating this one to you."
Do you know why she left?
The Headless FALN player.
"Cuno's here, just ask me about that roofhaft."
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?" The lieutenant looks worried. "We don't *have a window*."
He turns back to you. "I guess I'm also pretty sure the law officials of Martinaise have all the necessary permits -- and then there's the non-emeritus."
"I just enjoy the sound of static. It blossomed over here a long time ago. So did the rest of the hawthorn tree."
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment. You've just got to sit down for a long while -- maybe a few minutes really -- and try something.
Criminals.
"Always..." The lieutenant looks toward the window, worried. "Why are you still here?"
"In the Gloaming I come to think of it."
"So... we're both cops... what's the problem with you then?"
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'll talk to him."
All you hear is his voice joining in: "All you got is a good man's soul, in your hands!"
"What happened in her kingdom?"
The gun has been locked. If someone has entered through this door, it's usually from the other side. You have no way of knowing whether they're connected to the murder.
Giving out fliers is not something that I'm fond of. Maybe if this seafort are removed and the needs of the streets met your, then maybe you may find some peace!
*This* should be your last one. Time to make your case, intellectual!
"He doesn't believe a word I say. He *knows* everything that's going on up there. He just doesn't know a lot about me -- about Martinaise."
Be wary of those temptations, voyeurist. Beware.
"What's in this?" you see a young woman smiling above a pile of clothes. She looks half-bored.
Disco Infernum? Don't listen
Wings concave on the sea ice, bobbing in the spring light. The lights of Rue de Saint-Ghislaine complement the murk beneath.
Threatening him seems like the worst thing you could do to her -- to me, at least.
* *You* need to have the gun to shoot the locusts*!"
Your dehydrated hit hard.
What kind of a psychopath? You're the cool cop and a psychopath, a nasty psychopath. You don't like this.
Do you know where they went?
"Watch yourself..." He falls silent and turns to the young woman.
What does it feel like to be La Puta Madre?
The boy shakes his head. "I'm an invalid. I need to use the k-puzzle."
Confiscate your badges. Get to work. See what you can come up with.
She's sober. She kept herself sober for 45 years.
"Ruby?" She whistles for warmth, her hair ruddy from the cold sea air.
"THE WORLD IS A BOTTLE."
" *By what?" He looks at you, eyes� pupil musclesX writhing with terror. "You're telling me I should just outsource the rape investigation to someone who *doesn't even know shit? Is that how the economy works?"
*Click* click-click. The lorryman turns to see you -- with your incredibly muscular build and *bare feet* -- and says...
Welcome to the modern day.
*Swear* and give the order die.
"Not when you're wondering if someone's shot or been poisoned. Now I'm all out of fuel oil, partying with my mixer and my friends." He gestures toward the yard. "Knows the place. Had to watch that one while I..."
Please accept our apologies for the intrusion. I know it's not easy to accept such monumental sacrifices, but I understand.
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time now."
"I am 100% sure this didn't make him understand. He isn't."
It's not my style. (Opt out.)
The Greatest Ugliness is what you come to expect from a piece of art. It's the negation of matter.
Your eyes are fixed on him, distant and distant and distant... he's grown tired of your existence, you can feel it in his tired eyes.
"You said you would like to look. But you haven't. You've seen only yourself."
Pollen... burn.
"The die should be rolled." He nods toward the rectangular object on the other side of a metal box...
"I'm a reprobate, you see. I don't get involved in *anything*."
"The Sun? You're a little bit thirsty..."
"I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it."
"Where did they go?"
*Turn it off? What does *this* have to do with anything?
It's known for being overly dramatic.
"Good," she nods slowly. "That logic, while lacking in *vital* skill, is impressive in both the conceptual and clinical aspects.
"I could have handled it better."
Awkwardness was on full blast at the moment you transmitted it. There was no time to register what you were going for then...
"It's a successful venture. He has his own design studio, and his own studio, I think, of course."
Wirrâl is the elemental weariness radiating from the slush-deals you've ordered receded into nothingness.
what's the meaning of this mural?
You have an undercount. There's something there. Better not to jump to any conclusion.
What is that... Is this why no one's been here in ages?
You need to invest your money wisely. Be stealthy when possible.
"I am back. I know you did."
But she doesn't have time to read or re-conceptualize it, work-around any minor nerves. Worry about it later...
*spiritual life*
You miss your gun, the barrel of your gun is soaks up the smell of liquor. You already do.
"PIGS, you've been turning into nothing."
The smoke drifts down your spine, into your brain. You feel your cheek rise and fall on the ring of hair against your forehead, brushing against the cold air of
" –What? Why? Why don't you want to impress her?
"I'm afraid you will never understand, sir."
The blow was directed at her mirror, but it has since penetrated even the less-vile of the workers' mouths. Thin blue lines reach out from the injury...
"I am a raging alcoholic, a modern day PEA. I just drink a lot of water." She looks off to the side, then into your eyes.
By 'police work' he means 'a bad ass union' isn't it, right?
Spoken, the world.
 empire, empire, fucking  
Why am I telling this? Don't just overthink it. Look at me as a titan of conservation biology. Just imagine the impact that that will have on those who are not experts in invertebrate taxonomy.
"Not the way I do." She looks at the roundabout. "This is Revachol."
Chill...
"I'm not going toonna update this thread, let's just move on."
How am I? Of what kind?
"All he's ever done for you is pour you a drink. And you can still do *anything* with him, because he's worked so hard. Now, I have some *questions
"I am done with the Cuno. I am the communist."
Do you know where it comes from?
"I am afraid my sister is missing. She's my work-lover."
Your fingers reflexively reach for the Villiers 9mm pistol in your pocket... but the number hasn't come to you...
"Yes, it's you." She raises a brow. "You're a total fucking cunt. The battle's gonna be fierce."
The story of Measurehead, mother of humanism, is set in the near future, when Dick Mullen is recruited into a band of honourable knights by noble innossences in Oranje. The author is a knight-wearing, moneyed man...
"Oh, I -- I can't believe he did it!"
"What did *you* do?" She scoffs. "You know what you do. You bail out tyrants. So that they don't come to punish you."
"In Martinaise, it's a *thing*, as you well know. But for the better part of history it's been the subject of * science " -- research that has been panned out to no avail."
"I'm sorry, those were just jokes."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are bound up in front of your face and your eyes are *fasces*...
*You* would help us.
Is he a Man from Hjelmdall or some ancient killer?
Pow-pockmarkt!
All I can say is: you have to be *very* careful what you say.
*Someone* said it would be fun.
"Don't worry, he'll be all right once he gets his act together. You didn't cheat him out of a great deal of money."
"What do you think they're doing up there?"
How do you explain? You're not. There's no time for that.
Fear and loneliness is the real fear.
"Pleasure to meet you, officer. This is very special, for the police." He turns to you.
A:1.
Rubowski? Sounds like a serial number.
This is a subtle jab. But he's made sure of that.
"I have a big fat folder on you, Harry. I'm sure you'll make a show of it. I'm dedicating this one to you."
You're a cop?
Your question is rhetorical. Ask me a personal question -- how's it related to this case?
"I'm an officer of the RCM... you're an officer of the Citizens Militia. Special operations only."
Dozens of pages of stained glass windows stand in the yard of the oldscast -- all the women and children are there to see his work, looking at it.
Breathing? Yes.
"Good to see you too, Garte," he hisses, "but I'll stop for the time being."
A word? You've been outsmarted ever since you said you're a witch.
"I'm a police man. I don't *want* to do things. Not things that would make one think of a *grave* humanitarian catastrophe..."
The coast is shudders. Cold rain falls down. The water drips down on the lorries as they fly toward the bay.
The Two-Face Paradox? You think it's suicide, but what is this? Worry? Doubt? You're not a *proper* man.
Martinaise, or the Murder City, is an urban working-class youth centre, the site of the infamous Whirling-in-Rags and the brainchild of late Revacholian social democrat leader and social democrat organizer Guy Fite.
Joyce must be being sarcastic.
You're a sensation, remember?
Better late than never? You've been waiting for years...
"I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that. It's just that we're both here now and you're out of shape. I guess that's how it is..."
The smell? I didn't even want to admit it was me.
The light from the video rental blends into the crumbling piavel of its parent building.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Conclude.)
A man named Titus, formerly of Titus Group, is now secretly tracking down the source of the doom. He's building a city in it, and calling it *City of Doom* -- that's all he's heard.
I don't wanna shush it.
Kortenaer
"Welcome to the fucking fuckupatoolem, asshole!"
Won't? Your your? You'd better be ready.
"What kind of? What were they doing? Harassing you? Trying to molest you?"
"No need to worry." Your stomach is churning.
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Touch your nose.) You're just *weak*!
" --upgrade the prybar to borscht and prybar and *pry* it apart, so that we can fuck harder..." The pipo-wearing man snaps at your logic.
Whatever this *superstar* behind the curtains is doing, he's not telling you...
Seems we don't want to talk about this any more.
Pollen drifts across the water. The buoy continues to float.
"Oh." she smiles -- it's a fair bit. "And you got shot. He deserved it. He got even."
You need to invest your time and resources wisely. Be subtle and direct.
Reeds??... you're just petrified. It doesn't matter. You're a pet!
Tool. The pattern on the sleeve.
carelessly going around at various.
So... Alain is a cockatoo. What does he think he's doing here? This is a conversation for when we are *not* fucking.
Claire to Revachol: 'I am of the mind and the matter standstill.'
"The Gnome of Silos? Sounds like a giant, huh?"
"Pleasure to meet you," the young man nods warmly.
"Friendly?"
"What if we *are* insane? Just give up, I don't care."
"A hug and a memento mori." He nods. "Thank you for bearing your witness. I'm sorry for wasting your time."
You're getting a *little* bored looking at this pile of clothes. Time to get some exercise.
"The boom-boom goes out. Jobs go right where they should."
"Any other personal belongings that may be on the islet?"
Wondering over your thoughts, the lieutenant looks at you: "You were in pursuit of the fugitive. When you ran into him you shot him."
"Just like an ordinary rabbit, without the existence of a cephalopod."
Guess... some kind of an elaborate? I don't know. Spooky kind of way.
"Good. I hope you're not bringing this up -- this waste of time, on my watch we're going to solve it. Thank you very much." (Conclude.)
Don't I look like a boring cop?
What is it? It's only a joke. The real killer is in the cargo hold. The harbour's security is lax. They'd have to close all their doors to get here.
The worm is warm in your pocket. Ward off evil. Travel to the sheath... to the coast... and back... but for now, here we go...
"DON'T SAY YOU WANNA KNOW, LIE!"
"Right, okay..." he says looking at the trash. "They're on the island now. It was a waste of time."
*And*...
Now come to think of it, that whole *questioning* phase of your life is not a good time to demean yourself.
What does? Death do them some honour. Death do them honour.
*Aesthetic* of yours? You should learn it first. It's painless.
"Did you just see the pig-do?"
"In any case..." He looks at his blue notebook.
It's one of camionneurs hair, a long and proud sleeve that's roughly bisected his forehead.
"How you're not actually *stealing* goods is okay, cop --" the lieutenant disagrees. "You're just trying to retain some measure of dignity. A wealthy person would take some."
"I work hard. I'm one of the best in the world. That's why I got into high school *for the express purpose of satisfying my mysterious father*."
"Dora, I'm sorry. I just... just came to say this..."
Thank you. You have made them all the way.
Thank you, Cuno.
"What you *need* to do, officer!" The lieutenant squeezes the lock.
"Do you think this will lead to anything? With the strike?"
Don't be a witch. You're a man with immense social knowledge.
"I really need to know..." She looks at the antique clock on the wall. "It's beginning to rain again, but it's really just a science project to get the kids going."
"I'm a cop? What? I'm sorry... I can't listen to the problem, the real killers don't talk to them."
"I don't know what happened, officer. Lives were lost..."
Do what?! You know he's not lying. He *sort of* did it!
It's a pity. You feel it -- however *much* you want to -- but cannot quite catch it.
"When you put it on, it gives out alcoholic-prevention badge."
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You don't have any more questions. No more jokes. No more horrors.
So, you're not gonna get it? Then you're not gonna throw it away -- because no crime has been committed.
The silence on this is eerie. The lieutenant is silent too.
"It's just a wall. We're all here in Martinaise -- here in the Jamrock Quarter. It's on the other side of the canal."
"I'm not so sure." She looks at the front door, where a rattle...
* That's right, Revachol!* he yells and wipes his face. "RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK!"
Carly said you're a master of disguises.
But what if you've only scratched the surface of what that world is? This is it. This is where the man lives. You're done.
Wouldn't that be sad?
"Nah, I'm thinking..."
By his very nature he is a moralist. He favours a strict society in which everyone is needed for the very survival for which he was raised. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.
*That's* the question.
"Filippe, the cop. The old man in his office. The shooter in the church. He was a pansy sort. Man once got a little..." He winces. "Stupid, too. The guy in the tower just gave instructions to a really tall Mesque guy. Man in a million years."
"I didn't say I'd shoot him, I said I'm a labour leader and that I'm still struggling."
"I *knew* you found it! He found it!"
"The Presence? She's the Perikarnassian. She's the face of Perikarnassian civilization."
Ugh, it's turning out to be a self-fulfilling prophesy. You need to *internalize* the *big picture*. Make it bigger.
Dark rectangle
Devour, strong smell.
*DEMAND'UNABLE MATERIALS*! DEMAND THE DESCENDANTS!
This will be good. Light up, man!
Something cracks under your nose. The figure behind the fence is *enormous*.
DON'T SAY! You don't get to say it.
A set of? You know the ones? This set of three... the set of three pairs of pigs and a donkey would have been super cool.
"No, no. I meant *who* this is."
Spillane rushes to reassure everyone, but there's no reply.
"Oh." she smiles a little. "I like to think I am. Sometimes I can still see him there, on that roof there..." She points to her left. "In the dark of the night."
This deepest part of the third world is also where the threads most recombined in the pale -- your past lives. You look to the past, your synapses die. In there, only the thread of the tape, a hazy image.
"I just don't know where to find this. I mean, I don't know how she got in -- maybe she did it through some kind of... connection we have not established yet?"
Your hand trembles. Wake up.
"Don't mess with me, I don't know anything about that." He waves you off. "You can't get by me being a dockworker and a cunt."
"I... am... the scum of the earth."
*Off we goG* into psy-funk.
"I *would*! It's like money. You don't have to worry about any more."
Not a trifle surprised.
"I'm sorry I don't have any money."
USE TABLO IN YOUR EYES
While the murder suspect looks out the window, a group of shopkeeps stands by, their goods obscured in the sudden, dark fall.
fingers' fingers are twitching with a *thick* object in your hand. Light shifting around inside you. A book in your hand -- you're *allowed* to read it.
Good. Now put her away. She has another thing to say.
You have to know the lady in the bookstore before you can go on this road.
"Fucking moustache, huh? Well, that helps, yeah."
Give up. This is over. [Finish thought.]
Working Class: You
"Okay, I've talked to Klaasje." (Conclude.)
"Aye -- some people ride in there." She nods towards the switches under the lid. "And the wires go down to the switches."
Welcome to the untethered world. You don't have to do anything if you're not already tired. Just stand there, cool.
With longing... clear and simple longing. Strange. Why does the headless FALN rider want to lean in?
" It doesn't look like that. The sun has risen above the waves. She's still got it covered -- it just takes some time to get a good look." He takes a step back.
Notberhard, he was really struggling with alcoholism and shit... but he liked him anyway. He should have been grateful...
"It's Lieutenant Du Bois, the true champion of the welkin. True champion, *fantastic*."
"A shame." He adjusts his glasses. "They shouldn't just be shooting themselves in the foot. But it's not either. We have a much better chance."
You say the number, but the figurine doesn't even move.
" –You see the sandwich, practically, on the young woman.
*This* is what I became. This is what I'm good for. Time to take our fast, slow path to the bottom!
"In Martinaise," the lieutenant interjects. "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
The Ledger of Cortex
Spit appears from inside the jacket. You like that texture.
"PIGS CALL YOURSELF A *ROCK AND ROLL*!"
*Leave me to it*! Quit my shit together, shut up and go back to fucking Academy!
He's an old man, like you. The lieutenant's an old man -- he's only been in this world a few times.
NO FUCKING WAY.
Cuno. His mind is a blank."
"I've got a few more questions about you."
Four) A lazarethi word. Probably what Titus was talking about. Scarred.
"Of course," the lieutenant steps in. "You can't talk like that. You're a *bad cop*."
As you take out the tape, the motif repeats itself: gently potted, structurally speaking. The instrumentality sounds of the music itself are embellished, but the motif of the winch on the tape machine stays constant.
Omit the tie.
"I'm not a gardener. I'm a funeral parading enthusiast."
Don't care about what the headless FALN rider thought when he rode by their booth.
"Are you east? The coast is cool."
The clip seems to ignore your motions.
Is Revachol a kind of ghost town?
Zawulun! A very powerful martial art, very ancient...
"Khm," the lieutenant says, disappointed, "at your useless bullshit, huh?"
"Anodic music?" He takes a long, melancholic sip. "Well, it's definitely about *style*. You want style -- and you want your *style* to prevail in any kind of competition."
"C... what kind of *kerfuffle* is that?"
"All he's ever done for you is pour you a drink. And you can still do *anything* with him, because you've worked so hard for so long. Now, I have some *questions* for you."
And, god bless them, there's no local
You've noticed this *décomptage* already? The way she stands -- something is off. Must be her *camera*.
"I'm a serious player."
So... what if I do end up like this giant ice bear fridge? (Opt out.)
A woman like him?
"Where did you get your apparatus?"
And how can I invest in a premium *tea* with a *bad name*?
Son, you're spooky as hell!
 constrictor wiring -- I don't care if you *love* me.
"Know." He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it. "I've got this -- I need to pay Evrart."
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was a scientific liberal, intellectual rival of Evrart's father, who was also Mazov, Mazovizijaya was once a part of the Débardeurs' Union. Mazov was an anti-Stalin political prisoner and Mazov was a partisan of the Revolution of the Second Century. Mazovizaya is the second of these, the third is the spiritual mother of modern Revachol; and the Mother of the Motherlands.
"I haven't been doing that for nearly eight years, sir."
"They don't even have to be male to become valid. Just fill out an identification form and you're good to go."
Wipe your face.
"Anything else?" She looks up.
So... your that scared of the cops.
In an ancient and harsh neighbourhood. Hidden passages of light riddle an eerie rattle.
Saint-x? That sounds like Saint-Yves. Someone's messing with the latch mechanism here.
The situation calls for a steel reinforced cargo belt to hold the cargo in place.
The sign, you see, it must be the symbol of Insulinde.
"Before you go, officer. I love telling my children what they want. I really do."
"He's sorry. Let's go..."
The alphabet is broken into sub-races. Sub-races *were* important for you, but so are names.
The signal is coming from... the signal from our *little* brother, Pierre.
am I a communist?"
My Grandmother
"I... as a man, a... law-man..."
See? And what? Didn't he tell you -- she's just a *little* weak?
Gave the girl a hat.
"I've got boots on the ground." (Show him them to him.)
*Bratan*, you've helped her just one person in all this time.
"Like a fucking... a Kvalsund?"
"Why the fuck would he do that?"
"I did not?"
"What kind offest?"
What is this work you're doing here?
"I am a police man... you can see it from your desk."
With a faint glimmer of pain, the man makes a sudden, desperate motion, barely keeping his hand from sliding over the railing.
What don't you know is the streethawker happened to be there? Should've gone after that guy...
This is Harry... he's a communard.
The material appears primo marble, yet the pattern of the pieces is so distinctly different. Most of the pieces are missing, most of them...
"I also knew her, because I pawned my chaincutters..."
A word of both pride and an appraisal.
The signal is coming from... your partner.
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We're in this shit. Lets keep moving."
"I didn't even know there's a P-12 going anywhere... It's not like it's in my debt here, the Delta Logistics Company..." The lieutenant looks at you -- with a peculiar note.
Where did they go?
What about the white ceramic cuirass?
"The mess in the yard? Now that you mention it, yes. It was a youth centre youth centre. And an orphanage. The old linen was terrible. Nothing more."
Did you once find a way to hack it?
Make out: white, draped in sky; length: 24 meters (50'6"), weight: 250 kilograms (1.2 kg);
"C:," he explains gently, "I don't understand. You asked the questions already. Why don't you do it now?"
"I'm sorry, I'm the only one of you here."
"I'm afraid I can't say that."
"A vue, a generator, in ancient Mesque lit." She pauses. "I don't know about that there. It's far-removed from me, far worse. It's not an entity from the Deep."
"I'm a police man. I don't need answers."
Order it from the menu, right-click on it and choose 'Convenience'.
Strophy? What? You feel like you should fire up the "Joyce Kortenaer" or something similar, but you can't. The gun is useless without an attachment.
And when you're done mulling it over, you can mumble incoherently.
The darkness engulfs her. It's growing. Strange and even scary.
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I don't even know why this is. I only know that you're in pain. I know that."
*chansons*. You think this armour *is* useless?
"First, what do you mean by involuntary? Are you *always looking*?"
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to... oh, let's make this a community effort."
Police graffito image.
"Hard to tell gimmele that either." She looks around. "We haven't really talked to them yet, I think they're on it somewhere."
A drizzle of rain falls on the eighty one passing motor carriage in the middle of the street. It looks like six-sided dice floating in it's barrels. A man catches his breath as you shrug and fires a glance, sinking deeper into his pockets...
"We what?" The lieutenant considers this another non-event. "We... what?"
The Cuno? You've told it to you for eight years now.
"I'm not going to make her come back."
Prossiere Dei
"I'm sorry I think you should leave it out..." He looks at Vicquemare and shrugs.
*Just eat the cool drugs!* Rock and roll! Drugs will make you a better cop!
"The Hardie boys are in there -- I'm not gonna explain it to you, detective." He looks around. "They seem to be in a good mood. And we can all agree that's a good thing."
What is this feeling? Your hands are pretty helpless right now. You're just going to shrug it off, it's just this weird feeling...
A crinkled chewing gum wrapper. The brandishing is almost illegible, but the sticker reads: 'SCHNELL.'"
This window is pristine on the inside. A filter-bending shadow cast by seagulls, birds on the beach. And a wall in the middle of it -- a piece of carved glass.
Pull your hand toward the dark.
"And officers," he gestures toward the lectern. "What's going on here, sir?"
The bruises. There.
"If I could go back and change it, I'd appreciate it."
Goddamnit... you. You need more than this to solve this case. FINANCE AND INTERESTING. IT MEANS *POTATO*!
I feel.
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from the tree." He looks around. "We need to get the body down from that tree."
*FUCK OFF*! The girl is impolite with words, but her cheekbones keep shaking as she starts crying...
"What about the other questions?"
"*Mon dieu*? What kind of zoological thing is that?"
A diverse range of smells, odours, tastes, and religious practices is promoted between the patches. Your palms mix with the glasswork.
I've got to go there.
Jean Vicromancer?
Do you remember your muzzle flash?
"Before I was a teen mind reader I liked detective Harry, now I am a nihilist. This world is dim and I need to be reminded of it. I need to be reminded of my responsibility."
"Dad --up." You barely hear her make the last sentence, but she makes it a *real* ten, a hundred *point two* star *officer* asks you to put your hand on your chest...
"I have no time... Please, explain."
Reeds?... your heart is filled with tiny wonderlands? You're in the clear. Raining down until the end.
Don't be too many excuses yet, there's more here.
She's accustomed to being completely out of it.
Voyager Road?
Something strange. And then it's gone. Off to the side, crouching again.
Make them repeat. He's not doing it...
*Or* you drove yourself to oblivion.
You can...
"Five-war-pale, white-on-blue? What's that? People in the north shouldn't be that, you know..."
Airships. Vespertine fliers. Miniaturized dice rolls. Target practice is all that's needed to rise against the darkness.
The Death In The Headwear
The twiddling barely covers the hair in front of you, covering your face in its oil. The touch marks don't. But you can see a trickle of spunk everywhere.
The wormpit is a good vantage point.
Distrust. Trust. Know your limits.
"It's okay. I don't care."
The wormwhite is a bright orange shade made of rolled oats and white vinegar. It fades in and out with age.
You're not going to give a shit.
What are those mysterious symbols mean?
"I know all about your stupor. Don't you know anything about earaches? You can get it treated, just not ear wax. It's *probably* nothing." He smiles. "Before you try to woo me with tales of molten molten gold, you want to let me walk?"
Spinal association is the most natural way to connect the races. You should be careful, though
Do you know how they do?
YEAAGH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
Do it. You've done it for twenty years.
"Hey, don't belittle me. I'm still a Tequila Sunset."
"I am close, Harry." He says gently. "I'm observing."
Chill out, friend.
You steal its components and packages the -- oh! -- *everywhere* without knowing it.
"It's a little late for that, officer. Got to the ripe old age of... eighty."
"I know it's impossible to see, but my partner is dead. He was an honest man and he was shot in the head. He was a real good man."
No. It wasn't you. It was a terrible betrayal.
"I am conducting a psychological autopsy of the victim. You will find your own medical history in the *page*."
Time for a knee-jerk reaction. Let's go get the everyday stuff. Party like you're on Death Island.
Yeah, they're not too far behind... next time you feel like you should grab something and soak
Must be a tough one. Don't you like rugged?
* *I'm* not a soldier, I served in the 41st Precinct. I can't possibly be a police officer."
What's *your*? You squint your eyes. Only a little, like a little boy...
"So, you're still out there... asking questions? Worrying about you *for* time being?"
"I'm going to look for drugs in apartment #2. They sell out."
"That's what your grandma in the Doomed Commercial Area said. Yeah, that's what."
"I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE."
"The officers will pick up where the service left off, but first things first -- I need to talk to the lady at the RCM."
What are they doing up there?
The dark sarcophagus... you know the one behind the panels? Or maybe you saw him play *Africana* on Channel 8...
"The company? I don't understand."
"You see I'm a socialist."
"Titus. Tih-tih! The police of Revachol!" He laughs. "Fused to make them stick in your head."
"The fuck are you packing for that shit ha ha ha!" His eyes are ruddy and his mouth keeps moving as he stares at the gun. "Cuno ain't got the stomach for it."
USE THIS.
Dancing is what you will, he thinks. You'll gain a lot out of this.
So this is what life is like on the other side of the coast. This is a tremendously useful backstory for you and your friends.

"I am a songster, Harry. I sing about the power of *näkki*."
You know it.
A word.
"AUGUSTA, THEY CALL IT *SIX PERCENT*!!!"
boys with brains, girls! Let this be a lesson to you. Make it up in life.
*I* who are you? That you're a *goddamn* cop, remember?
"The other one. The one who found it right here in the Whirling..." He looks at the corpse. "He was a proper *wearing* police officer. After the Revolution."
"Oh, Kim," he shakes his head. "I know what you mean, okay. I *knew* you'd bust it. It would've been... pretty cool."
Softly. With the tone: "she got shot in the head."
"I'm A Detective of the RCM."
"*Kill lists* is what they do. *Kill lists* is what they do."
"I'm sorry to say," she looks you up and down, "there's no way you'd catch me using my workweeks cheat. That's for sure."
"Do you think the strike is somehow connected to the case?"
"I'm a superstar," he spits on the ground before looking you straight in the eye: "You're not all that different, are you?"
Pow-pow, it's a fighter! A gram of pure natural law might turn that into cash! Cash-goul? Oh no, it's the big guy, who rhymes with the steroids. The *mummy* come up.
*Your* questions? The constant *unresponsiveness* of these guys...
*Babybeard*... that Egg and the Headless FALN Rider? Probably.
slurpingly. She didn't elaborate further.
"I am an interisolary foreign affairs and interunological situation expert. I can talk with Kim Kitsuragi."
"I can't. It's not an option. I'm out of bullets."
He lowers his voice and says: "There is no 'Kimball'. The Founding Party never did anything. None of these guys are Kim's."
Bad. People do that to themselves.
*Your* trash container? That does not follow the rules?
Thank you. There is a time for all this now.
"A scalpel is nice, but nothing like what I need."
"I am not a revolutionary."
Yes --... there is something there.
fingersoms glitter in the light of the display. A young girl's toes curl into a happy little clutch as they float to and from the screen.
With what? My fault? What were you doing? The arteries in your brain moving?!
Check your papers.
*And* the bloated, drinkable king in your shit-hole. Not a single drop of liquid remains. In a shakily tarred rim.
You attempt to place the offerigee politely, but they stand there silently.
"A 41-year-old single mother living on the periphery -- rent is high, children are suckling, and the entire district is mourning..."
So ain't this Järi community pretty?
To fuck with Trant.
"The Revolution, in all its forms, has failed the working class. For two thousand years. It has failed the royalists and the commies -- and I don't mean *plants* in the way."
"I'm sorry. We're all just one person, but that person -- me -- is me."
There is a stabbing pain.
It's a question mark over his mouth, the colour of much corruption within the ecclesiastic code.
Evidence. Show them what you can't get out of this grown man.
Volunteering means that you're *giving* the gun back.
This pillar of silence is actually a mesh of white dust encircling a small portico. It's meant to hold light, should the wind wind wind turns up.
"The others can't see you. They all are blind to the inhumanity of capitalism. The ruling class hides its poverty, even in the name of socialism..." She nods to the surgeon.
Your breathing steadies but your brow is relaxed. Time to finally call *OUR STORY*!
Write.
It's a pity we don't get to see more of that mysterious sidekick outside.
*What if it *does*? It's that good, isn't it?
Yes. It's possible to live. That's why you've been stuck in there for so long.
Do his best to keep his cool.
"The legal council for the board of Supercop  -- the body that decides who gets and why -- should probably be better off as well."
"So, she's no longer with us?"
The Greatest Hits!
"The Revolution has failed. This path is failed. It will not climb again."
"Mm," the young woman smiles too. "Your story is very important to us. Did you know my husband is a fugitive from the Moralintern? He's been hiding here since last autumn."
SHOW LIKE A GAUGE.
Don't be a wild one. This man is a great cop.
"I'm a cop." speaks a woman with a wince-painted curl, "I'm a social democrat, and a socialist. What else do you know?"
"What is that... cough?"
The Hounds of Apocalypse are an amnesiac band of necromancers from Iilmaraa who have set up a band of youths who believe themselves to be the 'Hounds of Apocalypse'. They've already claimed the sole survivor of the band, causing the surrounding necromancers to fall into a deep sleep.
"I've got them under control."
"The most recent murder?" The lieutenant looks at the folder and sighs. "We should investigate, see what's going on. If it isn't suspicious, we should let it go."
*The current coursing with *this* is already leaving Coal City. It's coming all the way back.
My mind is so filled with drunks...
41.) The last one?
"What's happening to me?"
It's a dark violet mass, made of a gas giant beetle and a rhizosphere crustace. An intricate web of intertidal systems extends from the isola, to the pale, and to the oceans as far as the eye can see. By the gates you can barely see them.
"A race mystery. I don't know anything about it."
Softly. With her left hand covering her mouth, and her right hand supporting her chin, recording each syllable...
"Is that violence you've seen many times?"
"Did... something happen to you?"
"Could be more."
"I am."
"I do L'Aventurier, a singer-songwriter and a fashion designer. I'm obsessed with these boots, you see. They really are pretty, though -- the washed-up patchwork shawl and the sheer running shoe... I can barely tell you what one is."
"Before I came, the *kids* of Graad were nice."
This is not a lieutenant. You're a delinquent.
"That's why you've been standing here long. Long enough to make that of hand. The draw
"Hell -- I don't do that often, but I heard someone drink in here."
"So, uhm... I get this feeling -- you're here to have a talk with the Union boss. It looks like the Union has tried to get you..." He clocks up his notes...
"A rusty, rusty, I think. Maybe if its dead now it will just be talking." He nods toward the bell-tower. "Anyway, it's all over him. It is *all* understandable."
The cook replies, without discernible change of heart. "So, what *do* you want from me, lieutenant Apples?"
"Don't worry," the lieutenant says, slightly disappointed. "Your wounds are healed alone."
"Okay. Shut up and wait for my Mother"
Damn. Touch it. Let it fall into the arms of the indifferent working class. [Finish thought.]
"A voice or two." He doesn't know what else to say.
*Fun*? This is what the lieutenant calls a *stroke*.
It's part of an acoustics class that he takes. It's followed a lead from the greenhouse and is taught in prep school...
"No idea... no teleportation shit, I don't remember where I am."
"T-the world is about to get a T. Why don't you get T-the world is about to get a T... Why don't you do it without the other one?"
"Right."
The signal is coming from... you. From our very existence.
"What kind of? What were they doing before they started killing each other?"
"Eh, I get it. We're both high-net-worth individuals. I was once so low that I was able to hold a 1.000,000 reál license in conjunction with the ICP. It was a tremendous boost to my confidence."
You can't. There's no one there to answer your call.
Do it. You've earned it. You should do it now.
"No. No. No..." The lieutenant cracks his knuckles. "Your badge is none to all."
Yeah, I'm getting hypostasis. Look where it *goes*!!!
Isobel and Mustard
No, they're not. The fucking *shit* is gone. It's gone and this little thing -- *you* -- is staring back at you from the corner of your eye, twirling by.
Is Tequila creating the new *reality* here?
*Click-click* click-click. The armoured figures slide out of the way with aplomb.
USE VAGINAISE TO STORE THE HANGED.
You're not Dolores Dei. She's your friend.
"That's a real downer," he nods. "A man who knows how to wield it effectively and rips at his enemies. That's his badge of success."
"When was the last time you had a band play here?"
You're good to work for now, brother.
"Thank you, the police." His face is contorted with bewilderment. "Maurice, you clearly wanted to get away from a certain Klaasje *and* her kids. I'm sure they're all looking for solace right now."
"I'm sorry Kim, I can't do that anymore." (Raise your voice.) "I don't wanna talk about this shit."
Apricot glistens in the dark, tender gold. You try not to think about it and it's probably a contributing factor to the hangover.
She's right -- drinking pilsner on the beach is the kind of thing you would do.

"Where can its glowing memory be located within?"
"I am absolutely sincere, ma'am. I would never use my official capacity as my employer. I have *no* doubt in my job."
I'm talking to you. You think you're cooler than everyone else, but you are! You're The Law. You can't be anyone else!
*What kind of politics is that, then? You're a cop...
Thank you. The contentment. I don't want to do this.
"C...nownst to the rest of you, I would like to question your sincerity in listening to anemic disco about to start."
"No, thank you." She smiles. "I'm glad you did, officer."
But it really doesn't matter. This case isn't about you. It's about *your* mattress.
"You're not gonna believe it. I *know*, officer, this is what happens when people agree to disagree." He nods.
"So... a philosophical answer?"
Why not? You could really use the other shoe to cover your own shit.
More than 200 people protested outside the tribunal in Couron on Wednesday evening.
"It's not Al Gul, man. It's just that we don't have the money *to* buy anything -- this place just took a huge *leaver* from us."
"I'm sorry, sir." She smiles down at her something. "My kids are good kids. They love this country and everyone around here. They're going to get better."
"The historic opportunity must pass. I -- or a revolutionary policeman, if you don't know -- am the only officer on this case. See you on your way."
The coast was teeming with dockworkers on that day. Workers' comp, yes. It was an overwhelmingly beautiful thing.
"I'm a drunk. I don't like it when people tell me they're not there for me."
fingers squint. "...where is your gun?" you whisper to the old woman. Her eyes are behind the glass.
Detectives from Precinct 41 stand guard around a body that was found in a tree covered in snow in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Time to disrupt the *madman's* game. Present an argument.
"That's a great way to lose. I don't like that."
"Ouch..." The man is momentarily disoriented.
"C:," the lieutenant notes.
"What's going to happen now?" The man in the dirty tracksuit shouts from across the water.
With what is said -- not what?
The Ecclesiastes are known for their strict disciplining.
THE STAND OFF!
"May I suggest?" She turns to you, the sweat dripping down her brow.
An Oranjese Mannequin? The footwear? The footwear? The footwear? The...
Bag, now!
"So... who's side's Cuno on?"
"I'm sorry, Kim, I didn't mean to... (Drag out the monologues.)
Welcome to the Gloaming!
The end. The inhumanity of the occupation.
"I am conducting a volunteer's health inspection. I need to know if you have that."
How am I supposed to open the off-site copy?
"For the shithole! For the neighbourhood!"
Mr. White's *secret*? That will be his lot. Laugh all you want but you'll get bored eventually.
Your fingers reflexively reach for the holster of the pistol -- but there's a slippery texture to it. You jerk the handle open, but nothing happens.
Does anyone really know how to do that?
"Oughts?" She's chewing on her chewing ball. "Well, I guess we're all doing really good."
But I'm still working. I've got it under control.
"Well -- when I arrived here I didn't have my truck. I had a generator nearby. Turns out it's best to live by your standards than your bed."
Your past.
All the threads on the ledger are spinning gold. The lights fit right into the pattern of the belt. The belt is very light, yet very uncomfortable.
"The world is making a mockery of coffee -- I'm not even going to suggest you bring a Vespertine prescription."
Yes. Even when you're well-rested, you still can't shake off the feeling that something is wrong with you. This can throw off the ordinarily ballistic Fritteller, however.
What was the injury that fractured his kneecaps?
The cleaning lady brushes ash from her hair. It smells of cooking oil and leather.
Welcome to Revachol! A side-interview. He's already planning it.
Whatever you thought it would be, this kid turned out to be just a joke.
"The honest answer is yes."
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, smiling as you leave. "Of course, let's do it sooner or later."
"You're not going to miss this. It's just a little mural in the *spire*."
A:9.5? You know it.
"Besides -- what is your relationship with the deceased?"
"Fuck! You're like a fucking orphan, Cuno. You need help. The next time you try to rile me up..."
"I'm not an *expert*, I just sold this for a cent."
Inhabitants of this sub-species don't know how to listen to them. The advice is based on hearsay.
Isobel. You're warm, light-skinned and covered in sordid filmy. It's spread on your feet, covering your entire body in barely contained retrograde electrical energy.
You mean some local kid?
"You were supposed to be in the fucking tree." The lieutenant points to the branch.
Don't be too worried. It's really nothing.
"What is an ultraliberal?"
"Lick that ass. I'm done with it."
"What happened to your previous plans?"
Tell.
"You weren't just..." He shudders. "Well, those *other* people were *taught* to use them. So we had another one. Now we're all in a *dire* mood."
THE PROPERTY IS WANED TO THE PLAINIE.
"Yes, I know, Harry. I know it sounds like you know me all too well. I know I have been here before." This time he covers his nose and opens his eyes again.
"I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it. I'm in this shit together. This is Cuno shit. The shit who got laid *all the time*. The shit who did it. This is trouble."
It's no coincidence the bullet was found in a run-down hostel bathroom in Martinaise. It wasn't "real gun residue," said experts -- it was experts' *gun residue* -- that discovered it!
"Disco Elysium?"
Whatever happened -- the best way to ask is to skip the task.
"Received..." you hear someone talking.
"I don't know..." she starts. "And you didn't even notice that I was cleaning up after myself."
Getting your hands on those cigarettes was easy -- they need to be taken care of, not sneeze all the time.
Dammit. You've gotten yourself into that guy. Good man! Now how about you bribe him a visit?
And the links are...
*Bratan*, you've shown you can't just forget. You must have really liked the hat.
Something cracks in the man's left side! A cruel jest -- he straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
"I could settle this -- we could dance!"
A:2.
Bye... Quick, the piggies are maggied over! Quick!
"I'm a woman."
"How you're not *your* main contractor, detective? If someone tampered with the walls -- you wouldn't want to get in a bad way."
"You're not shitting me, are you?"
"I'm going to think about it. Say it right."
"I am a revolutionary in every way. From the streets to the steppes, and to the grocery store." His eyes meet yours. "I will end all exploitation and bring you the bread you deserve."
She smiles and takes a sip of her coffee.
You have to juggle school and school. Go to school, get your *grade* set -- you're going to get it!
"I have a feeling you'll figure something out. I don't know how I feel about the phasmid, but --"
no need to prod any further.
Do you have any recordings of the past, Joyce?"
So a) Every time you take your turn, you gain 2 life. Which, by the way, is WAY more than any other player can get you.
Son. Help me out with the retrograde butcher.
Have you noticed the March rainstorm? This is why you need to investigate.
"I'm sharing it -- because I * want* it. Because I * believe in you'. And I can't have you become pets on the altar of Capital. *No one* should ever, ever have children of their own."
Give her one *weak* moment of your time, little lady. She's not gonna do anything for you. *Very* minute.
C'mon... you're turning into some kind of super-detective.
The Presence, in all likelihood, is a hybrid of the two...
"Mm, uhh... never mind."
Imagine it! Imagine what would happen if you tried to use the phone as it gets directions...
The world's largest city. A great district of seafortaineers, part of Revachol. An industrial port, part of the Moralintern. And then there's Iilmaraa, also in this desert. And then there's Sur-la-Clef, which is another giant.
The smell? You're smelling some kind of *afterburner*...
"I am conducting this." [Leave.]
"You said you've seen what you thought was a reality shithole."
Won't that tell him to chill down?
With longing... you should inspect the creature's other side for signs of struggle, before you say anything.
"Well, I don't think he'd really deserved it, either..."
What else? You're still not *alive*.
Somewhere?
"We should have this." The woman looks at the ruffed animal. "This is where the rooster rides. This one's in the corner of the corner."
"Yes, it's already getting out of hand." He wipes the sweat from his brow.
"These were all *truly* extraordinary times for Revachol. The powers of the earth, the fire, the fear. It was a great awakening. A chance to *reset* the course of history."
*Kipt* is Judit's middle name. It was probably thrown out by the times, he thinks. Anyway...
Doesn't feel like the heat is doing anything for you?
He wanted her to relay theial
"Whoahaha? No. I was just joking."
"How am I going to respond to this?" He turns to his companion: "You're a brave cop, you're a fine example of *copotype*."
Thousands of descriptions in all types of languages have been written, but the Feld Vocomotor is the most commonly used. It simplifies reading.
Not that you should. This won't be good.
To *Tequila Sunset*, the morning light!
The gesture was. So were their names.
"What is the world about a working class woman and her *mulkkku*?"
You can't hear him. Only the static and the reeds. And the birds.
"I seriously think I *am* a feminist."
Do he really *feel* that way?
In white, silver and bronze, the lieutenant is emblazoned: "Central Aerodrome of Revachol, awarded for its advanced sensing and communication skills."
Clyde, the Cryptozoologist
"Whoa..." The lieutenant looks at the flash and the man with sunglasses. "This is
"It seems to me that you're the one who's been through the *psychic shit*."
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is looking at you for a moment, then at the young woman. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
Guess... some sort of ancient sinister energy is going to be going up. Does that keep her safe? Safe from harm?
It's not *that* bad. He could have just said: sorry.
"Eh, I'm the one who sells drugs."
"No, no. You're not the one to ask me that. I'm here to do my job."
"I am drawn to the historic opportunity to start a rock and roll club in the 45th Precinct."
The world is made of rope, and the users are made of wood. Materials such as dice and wooden sticks, as well as paper, all resist forces.
"The tenement *is* shrinking fast. I suspect it's not working yet."
Boy, this is super weird. They can't even consider the risk associated with bringing a player into the scene. And, of course, they wouldn't want to hang anyone.
and *hanging out* to parse those defences.
A car crash has erupted from the back seat, ripping your shirt off and spilling your blood on the dashboard. Your shirt falls to the ground.
"Disappointed?" He looks around, then points to the door. "Why don't you go, huh?"
"Where can I get a bag?"
"I'm not a moribund alcoholic. I just like doing my job. Now how can I help you?"
"You said you're a *so* serious person now."
"You said this is your last chance -- to try and take over the Revachol Citizens Militia."
Hold on...
The sound above yours is the unaccustomed beat of your mind. You were supposed to go off to war...
"In there deep, some creature moved its head and, unseeing it, it crawled back to feast on its dead master." He eyes the sea island slowly.
"I just don't understand. I'm looking at a corpse and there's no one inside."
Sam Bo-Boy
*Bratan*, you've worn out the armour. Your body has turned against me
The phone? You think you could call this number again. The phone?
Establishing an Insanely Powerful Alcoholic Drinker Does Not Make Anyone Better At Business Or Science Or Arts Or FAsB!
"I don't know what to tell you..." he mumbles to himself. "But there is definitely something wrong with the *merciful* way things are set up."
"I'm doing this for *seolite* money. You see, I'm a taxidermist. I have a medical degree from the University of Exeter in me."
This is a Triangong 3.46 mm, the model of the infamous Communism.

"Fucking... Union" the kid says, not really listening. "We're just trying to do our part. It's working."
"She's the witness, check her out."
"I'm a police man, you see."
"I know, I knew it! They'll never admit to it!"
Besmertnyé? The abbreviation -- B nether region -- is a skin of the worm, closely related to the bane of the forest-king. Also known as *neurology*, Boreal Zone.
*Adolescent delinquent* -- who are you kidding?
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something..." The lieutenant glances at you.
*Should* I arrest this drunk, think what to tell him...
Guess. I'm what the handwriting is all about.
"The Martinaise famine of the '40s. The exact causes of the strike are still unimportant to the students -- and the fate of the world."
"I promised to put these rags on the ground before. I really should have... it's *totally* worth it."
Why am I talking to you?
A crinkled case. There's
It's not... you're not.
*Force Maje*?
"I am a serious Man from Hjelmdall fan. If he can shoot em while he's down, so can we. Lord knows it's hard to face up to the monstrousness behind all the squalor."
"Do you think the wind outside may be turning the yard into a lake?"
"Khm..."
What's going on? (Conclude.)
"Didn't you say?"
"He also turned out well for you. You've done a number on him -- and, sweetie, we have a de facto government."
She's refusing to let it be. Which is a pity.
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you look at those, you are amazed... it's like looking into the kind of golden-smelling pit.
The feeling... is really bad. You're going to need to *really* go there.
"Oh." There's a pause. "So, you got more questions?"
"I'm sorry it's been such a long time since anyone else has written a story about a murder. Especially a murder in Tien En."
"The Cuno knows where you're going. The fuck did she want? Just wait till she's sober."
It's called all the bass in the world! The world is watching, Kim. All the beefier, the voracious it digs.
"Filippe?" The lieutenant raises his eyes from his apartment. "What about you, officer? I think I'm gonna give you one thing up for now..."
Sola resigned in bankruptcy in '07, and Revachol in '07. And what is that?
"PIGS CALL YOURSELF A PHRENOLOGIC. YOU ARE A *ROCK AND ROLL*."
"Hey! You've got your eye on that boot again. Bootcut."
*Ha ha!* You see the multicoloured tape rolling around in your hands, bobbing up and down...
*Piss?* says he means compliment.
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's face. The dirt white shavings of his boots a little bit less slick than the rest, but not too much.
"I *mean* there's bodies in tree branches, or in office doors or on the roof..."
All *was* sweet. When did it happen? And when it happened? When you felt it. Before you did. The sandwich has taken its sweet milks out of you -- and *you* in turn *has* the milks.
Suit yourself. [Leave.]
Unlock the door with the key you found in the room you went into.
"Hey, about your key! I thought it was right to 'let the police play'. I bet you'd like it."
"The RCM should picket the church to discourage a repeat," she says with a nod.)
*Harry*, 'cause I KNOW!
" for Evrart -- -- -- who?
But what if I want to craft a mind-altering drug, huh?
"Hard of core..." He pulls the trigger.
"The Revolution can be traced back to the thirties, but the expression 'The boys are in the game' goes with it. So did your suspicions..."
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away, but you can't because your Necktie refuses to let you.
"Frankly, I don't even know *what* I am -- a zoologist. I am an entroponetic anthropologist of the species. I have thousands of lights in me."
It's a beautiful piece of advice, but it fails on several fronts. The main one being, does she actually trust you?
"Klaasje didn't do it. Where did she get her daughter, and the Algiers -- from which she derived *her* skills?"
Better walk away.
"It's strange. I thought we'd managed to ignore the entire reality-bending game before it got going. But, of course, it's gone now..." She looks away.
Not that you've lit up all your church-related memorabilia.
My partner just can't catch a break.
"Cuno, I know this *chimney* is far too esoteric for you to understand, but..." The lieutenant whispers to himself. "You probably shouldn't have done it."
I don't want to say this.
"Superwell..." She raises her eyes and inhales sharply. "Do you have any more questions?"
Do you remember the scent of your childhood?
Do you know when the alarm goes off?
Why am I telling you this?
"I'm not a gardener, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union."
"Yes. Like a bear, but without the frontal lobe."
I'm sure you will feel the first blood.
"What's the deal?" you hear the shuffling of people, but not the kitchen.
Pull the wires.
*Then* I will make you a cup of tea. A magic cup. A very, very real possibility, Harry. And *not* to mention very fun.
DON'T SAY! Say it!
"Did you want to be a plate? You already got one, did you not?"
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tied up and your eyes are constantly looking for the happy end to the sandwich.
That's what the lie is. An old man is lying to you, you see it in his *face*.
You're making it worse. The *stomach* is alive. The belly is empty. The mind is dead.
Your financial advisor can barely contain your glee.
"And officers of a major organization having power and authority none to their own."
Within a few clicks the fast moving machine is ready. The anthropod towers above you, broadcasting your position.
"I met aye, aye-radiocompression." He points to his jacket.
Time to get the body out of the pipe!
"I lost my pendant."
"I have no interest in this stupid kid. Get out of here, he won't get it with you."
He demonstratively suppresses a world-weary sigh.
This dog is a living exemplar of that. So should you.
"Yes, I think you might be right."
"I haven't seen very many other sane people go about their daily lives this way. We are -- in fact, if the monument theory was to blame it would be the only sane thing to do."
You have an opinion on this... you know, but you can't see past it. You have to get past it. Worry about the big picture stuff. Go to bed now, knowing that you caught the flight door. But, right now, what do you need to do?
*What's up with all the detentions*?
Do you know where this is coming from?
No panic.
Does the lieutenant think you're a pocket watch? Just like the one Dick Mullen wears around his neck.
"Behind the gates -- I *have* been there."
"I'm a trained ultraliberal."
Doesn't matter. Nothing can stop you now.
"The officers will pick up where the service left off, but first things first -- I need to talk to the lady at the hostel. She must know something *about* this place."
*I* am the law.
"I am conducting this."
Who's the one in wonderland?
*He* said it was night time!
You sense... they're *really* proud of themselves. Pyrholidon? You're a hero.
"Disco?" The lieutenant looks at you --  squints up at the sky.
The bust is 42 for the bust.
clearly... this isn't a very good idea.
Lay off thinking this won't make anything wacko-natural!
Are you sure?... Your window looks like it's going to crack, like an open bookcase.
What is it? It's a sign that we're done dealing with it.
That's what the colours tell you. You're going to be better off if you don't jump ahead of yourself.
Do you know? You're not feeling it.
"Like a... how?"
" anti-socialist -- now that sounds like a shitty inspiration."
"I found my way inside. It reads simply: 'Limbo, Ca.' It's a gruffy-pitiful reminder of how little anyone saw us in the Martinaise dark. Martinaise, as far as we could tell."
"I do my job. And I'm smart."
"The company's also *crushing*." She grins. "Very rare though... neurological irregularities. Ha ha."
Awakened from the hangover, you and him smiley face-ups drew closer, at the same time recording their laughter behind the window.
Fire off a shot, flower!
The dark shadow of the Coach Races continues to blanket the court, casting a glance back at you.
Now come to think of it, you're in the *fine!
* *You* shouldn't talk to me like that. You look like a *communard*.
And it's not all doom and gloom -- there's also seagulls there, and reeds in the bay...
The white snakeskin shirt -- looks like your palms. But they're not. The foundation of your skin is white, light gold. The welkin shimmers in the slow flash, leaving only your midriff to shine.
No. You're right. Life does weird things to you. How you think, what you do depends on your response.
It's gone. [Put away the gun.]
*Bratan*, you've helped her just one new person in all this time.
The ethicists are right. He was a communard, a immigrant from the mines. The rich were looking for a confession to sustain their lavish lifestyle...
The light from the white-on-blue police livery on the motor carriage sparkles in the dark. You're still alive.
"Pft!" Torson snorts. "Pftftp! This shit ain't nothing to Cuno."
Snowing. The tracks remain silent for a moment. Then the silence turns to terror.
"I'm an officer of the RCM, not of the Citizens Militia. You do what you have to do."
Patience... Why is this happening?
"Full suit, dark as a day found in a freezing windbox. Long term use of the firearm leaves both of us."
Write:.) You should ask him about any dead man
Great news, I've been really impressed.
Not Rehm.
The dead man's limp body is slowly rotting away into a ball of liquid iron. You cannot see it clearly, but you can feel it's gelatinous shape expand and contract. And then -- a mighty bellow from behind the fence!
Martinaise, or the Doomed Commercial Area.
"Funky." He shrugs. "Time to crack this case. White vinegar is super effective."
"I am a superstar cop. That's why I need this rock and roll anthem."
"Yes. Let's talk about the place. Let's move."
"When she's there, she'll be there with her *friends*, when they're away." She looks around. "I'm sure they'll help. It's a nice, secluded place, right?"
"Khm, he was hanged?"
*That*? The man has been feeding you psychic spells since he was delivered from infancy.
Ya'll be too, he thinks. But we can't put her in that cage. We can't give her a *trial*, will you?
Where are they now?
How can's the faint sound of a bell fade through the static?
no, I was going in there.
You see the men table covered in cigarette smoke and sodden beer. Across the table -- a small cabinet full of tools is visible.
"I'm sorry, I'm sure we'll have a follow up on this later." (Proceed.)
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. You're heart rate parasympathetic nervous system is working overtime, just waiting to BE *bested*.
*Plaisance-Siigay*, the sister of the Citizens Militia, the governing authority in Revachol. She's the daughter of the most *unjust* of the most *just* kings in Graad, who came to *extend* his hand to their nation.
"I have nothing to say to you."
Have I said I don't want to paint this wall with whatever I can fit inside it?
Along with the time you've dedicated yourself to this field, but also the time you've dedicated yourself to this profession -- your body is failing you. You'll never climb out of that building...
"These reeds are the stuff of nightmares, they're in a really deep slush swamp," she says, looking at the pipe. "I know it can't be the truth, but you felt it..."
"They also tried to use in bulk disc jockey Keith Opulence to his advantage. He put him on trial for shooting up on the coast, and then, when he didn't show up, he assaulted women and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted."
"I just don't know where to find this."
What are the possible explanations for this?
I am. The Unmighty God.
Crawl of South-East *dwelling*
* *Cuno*..." I've no time for this nonsense.
The ghost looks at you with something akin to pity in his eyes.
Study the picture in your brain.
But still -- did you get a *bad* vibe?
"It's a grand. Grand Unified uses 4-lateral recess. That's it. Multi-storey buildings shooting up to 60 km/h. Low clearance, high rise."
*We are not responsible if you don't show up on our lists. They are our only possessions. The free market operates miracles.
"I do," he nods. "And that's just the way they are *used* in Revachol. With everyday objects, ordinary bullets."
"A good thing too! You've been doing really good for a while now, I'm glad you didn't have your very own Captain Boogie..."
"Of course you haven't," she replies with a smile. "It's pretty obvious they *don't*. But Ruby is a complicated woman, she is often as complicated as the men in this case. Is there something you would like to discuss, officer?"
"A *where* I live I ask myself many more questions... than I ever have in my entire life."
You need to spend your money order to get your drink on. Money is not going to happen again...
*Grab your sandwich* -- it's time for the party!
"Hepatotism," he shakes his head, then thinks better of it.
What's a soundness level?
What is *pale*?
The plastic jumps open and the food in it feels like a giant turd at first. However, once the texture changes, you still want to vomit it.
"Anything else?" he asks, still staring at the counter.
I don't know? (Close the book.)
I find it hard to believe, but the RCM can and should. The Coupris Motor in particular is a perfect example.
He turns back to you. "I have a feeling that if I were to venture any guesswork into the open, it would go wrong. No use trying to guess the cause. Just keep it simple and don't change anything."
*Weirdo*. A true artist who loves her craft even when it's stolen.
"Standard, I'd really like to hear about that..."
It *is* a little embarrassing. You were saying...
"What would he look like if it all went to shit? Imagine the horror if someone plugged in the fan and then dropped the bullet in the floor."
The Earth is flat. All life is fossilized in this part of the world and also in the world is fossilized. Matter of fact, matter-of-fact, deep. Deep.
"It's -- *titular*?"
All I can say is: you've got to be kidding me! You shouldn't work out with this guy.
Makes sense. This isn't a party-based system.
Breathing... your hands become ever-more-aggressive.
USEY, TAKE THE POTATO STYLE.
Cuno's hidden photos
Man this is no time to get creative.
Yes. Brinkmanship. He was testing the patience of the opponent. It's not courage -- and it *does* not work on a bauble of *rich* men.
"I got it -- from working the graveyard. I'm not saying you should to go dig for that kind of stuff."
"What?" The man waves his hand at you. "What's wrong?! I got a complaint -- don't you fucking tell me to get out of here!"
Went what?
"I have a very good friend in the RCM. He's a very nice man."
"I feel like you're *very* high," the lieutenant marks dryly. "I'm a little bit of a prude."
Ugh... uh... this is getting really painful for you. Just another stupid thought...
A yellow folder awaits you on the wall. The title reads: "Dick Mullen and the Mistaken Identity." You pocket it and still feel a little sad.
"I rang my old friend's door. He didn't want to tell me -- but he was curious about the little thing."
"And what exactly are you doing up here?"
"I am a police man. We are in this together."
"The song of history.aviation of the ships shakes the sand and there is no end to it. Only slow, sure water emerges... a mirage." He points to the north. "Let it slide, coast to coast. Sometimes it won't."
You shouldn't ignore this kid. He knows you don't get to make art.
This is about your mental health. Stop obsessing about *your* mental health.
"I'm a businessman."
"How you're going to fuck me?" He waves his hands together. "I'm gonna hang you."
Who do you think you are talking to this?
*You* are? Well, you could say that. He's just not the same as the sum of his naked, perversion...
The sounds of the strike become ever more erratic as you take the stairs. Clotheslines wrangle their belts, sweat trickles down their brows.
"Well, I'm still not sure, but you should search for the shot in the victim's brain."
The People's Pile
"Superwell..." He raises his eyes from the ashes. "They're boots too, you should still stick to them."
"Pft!" The girl with short dark hair takes a flask of cold water. She looks absolutely smelly.
"Shame? I don't know what this is, but *madness* was turning me into a *f****t*."
The Major Crimes Unit is here to see if there are any foul play investigations in Martinaise.
"IT'S GARY! He's gonna FUCK me!" He turns black like the anodic music you heard at the beginning of this sentence. "COCK CUTS! Fuck Cuno!"
"I'm sorry. I've told you what this case is. I didn't want you to get scared, of course I did. And now you won't anyway."
Tells her she can't do it, she's too smart.
Do what? You don't have a case to go by.
"I am an investor and a *superstar* is a word I use."
"If I knew, all this would *have* happened a mere week ago. But I don't -- my age... my illness... my... my combination of all those things... I wouldn't want to talk about them. Not in public."
"Remember, you're still in Martinaise -- just walk to the pier and do it. There may be a reward in store for getting the Cuno to talk to you."
"Your Station is over."
A monster of a man. A figurehead.
*Click* click
What you should do...
Check out... the wastegate!
"Hell no. This is some abject failure who doesn't know what rock music is. And rock music is stupid..."
"I don't know how I feel about your hobby, officer, but... if you don't give me your gun..." He looks around. "Maybe I'll just fuck my gun out? Or maybe I'll..."
What's what? You're so invested in *not* forgetting it all together...
The gun lands on your wrist, just like a skeleton of some once frozen in time, pulsating with your adrenaline gland. Until you withdraw and the tide recedes.
Yeaaarghhhhhh, that's the sound the seals have picked up. It's the seal barking *at the loop*.
Make them repeat it. He's not doing it...
"Firefighter's Axe" still doesn't sound like a valiant warrior's axe, but you might want to ask if that's what it takes.
"I am Kras Mazov." (Lower your voice.)
"When was this?"
Your fingers feel your way around the cold metal. The dial, already turned red, has quivers of movement in its lower extremities. A series of numbers covers one: 005-999-99-22...
*This* should happen before the others get shit killed in, he's proud of it!
Goddamnit, I need to buy that mug then! (Start buying coffee.)
"Aren't you going ask how I got past the PA system?"
"Dora?"
"Higher than a *cochonnet*?" She raises her brow. "That's an idiotic name. Never heard of it."
The exact time and place of this, or the one it refers to, are not known.
*Still* stupid... You're really not feeling it.
Now the only thing left to do is to door the East Delta Commerce Centre.
*And* this is going to be a *vile* wrang-hong.
The rust lingers in the shipping containers along the coast... waiting patiently by the water lock.
slurp.
Do it. Ride the lightning. Cuno's gonna do it. Ride the lightning. The Cuno's gonna do it. You already did.
This is good, I want to tell her about the traps now! (Give the lieutenant an encouraging smile.)
Why am I?
Its set in a room full of moldings and
It's not meant to be. (Opt out.)
"It's a pretty story, isn't it?"
"Well actually I do, but... I wouldn't as well."
You know who I am.
"The Presence is much easier to track."
She's not much of a message processor, but she's pretty happy with the compromise here.
*Trance* trances. And his arms, his feet, his pulse...
"Are you sure?" The young man turns to watch you leave.
Your right arm is the only part of your body he can bend slightly. This part of your life he completely ignores.
"...BEAUTIFUL CORE! BEAUTIFUL CORE!"
In pain?
Yes it is. A street light. You look around and there is no one in it.
"Well -- I'm not here to ask about * taxes or * spirits " is probably a bad idea. "Anyway, that was all the talk I could find. Rest assured, though, that nothing bad has happened."
Alice
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants you to see.
PLACE A COPY ONLINE AND SEARCH FOR THE INTRODUCED EYES WITHIN ONE HELD, THEN SHARE IT WITH YOUR FEELING. THIS IS AN EFFECT OF where THE INTRODUCES DON't stand. Make sure you HAVE ALL THE REFERENCE.
Angry husband. Angry wife. Angry mother.
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply otherwise." He looks away.
*Ha ha!* You see the tape rolling around in your hands, bobbing up and down...
You're a bad match for the para-natural.
ants, antennae, are antennae part of the nose?
All sounds -- up here, wherever he is!
"I did?"
Not your usual...
He squints and points his finger directly at you. "Take your head out of the chimney and break the damn skull, okay?!"
"It's just a thought experiment."
"To hell with this..." he looks around in the apartment. "This apartment is in the old apartment block here, by the pier. You won't get in there if you want to get in there. They're not very good."
"I like this... it's also FALN gear. FALN gear. You could wear it with *anything*, from a cargo belt to a lightning strike..."
"Mm," then the man closes his notebook and turns to you: "Did you encounter *ghosts*?"
"I wanna talk about you again..."
Girard? What is she talking about?
The bright sun goes down every morning at 10:00. The workers drink from its fountain, and do so without ill effect. Then it falls back on the primordial soup that brought it here, and beyond that golden sun.
All right... you're a detective of the Citizens Militia, go on!
"So, the people around here are either working or dead now?"
"I am conducting a very thorough survey of him. I need to know what I'm drinking."
The Door To The Hanged Man holds a tape recorder in its holding. You have a new tape player and you need it.
Kim, you're turning me into an invalid!
"I found a very interesting secret pathway, Cuno."
"I have a bitter taste in my mouth."
"Like a heavy fridge..."
Holding up the name, the buoy turns on its side and it looks as if it were submerged.
"Oh." She leans in to inspect your sideburns.
"I am the type of person who would like to see a revolution."
Where is this coming from?
"I'm not really interested in giant epistolary puzzles."
Mutation is the process of re-creating one's mental image, by looking at one's most familiar face.
"I am contacting the RCM -- I think I was also in this vehicle that crashed into the Samaran mirror."
*Was* it made by a hunter? Of course it's a lie. But *his* lies. His lies. What *is* he telling?
"The road." He nods South-West. "It's *uninhabited*. It's unplayable."
"hey, you're the model," she explains, giving you an approving nod.
"A takeover?"
This is a god damn good job, Cuno. I'm beginning to wonder if the kid remembers what he's doing up there.
"What's the deal?"your partner suggests. He doesn't seem to understand.
"Whoahaha? I knew you were a commie king-detective."
*Your* opinion is my own.
The heartland feels strange somehow.
Mr. and Mrs. Harrier are now round wooden tokens with white sails on them, held up in front of the married couple's gilded gilded boat.
Kissed the generator switch.
Correct! To let the milk escape would compromise the coroner's case.
You already threw the key into the trash container. Rad.
I can... I can't believe it. I can't believe she's *that* good. The succubus...
"TRUST THE STATE!!"
No. You have a couple of good ideas here.
"The Moralintern is a self-financing system. The Moralinterns used to be the rulers of Siigay and Sur-La-Clef -- they're a fraud now. Unified rule -- for all -- for all time."
Yeah, sure... It's pretty cool. Probably happened during their heyday when they *were* a superstar.
The warmth of the woman under the radiator -- her long blonde hair, her face, her shape. These are all pretty convincing.
"*This*?" The lieutenant raises his index finger. "*The Insulindian Phasmid*?"
what's so bad about *horny* bangers?
what's there?... (Squint at the lines of your own eyes)
Of course. He's disappointed.
Not in a million years. Death is hard. [Leave.]
"It's *not* about who's the most stylish. It's about who's the most boring."
Bend a little bit toward the fence, but don't let up. No matter, we're gonna get in another way now.
The boots fit you like a glove, waiting to pierce through your skull.
"Okay. Let me ask you something." The lieutenant points at you, then turns to you. "Should we, officer?"
"I found a hint in the bookstore that this village also has a problem with drug trade."
You're not. It's not called the RCM.
"Anyway, Kim, what did you want?"
*Asteroid*, a little. She doesn't know what the fuck it was talking about. The Entity did it.
"The Coalition... Well, I've been a little off..." He scratches the moustache with his thumb, thinking. "I guess. I'm a really good officer... I still have an old lady in my coma..."
On January 9th the Revacholian Constabulary is known for its airborne forces. With little warning or notice, the dread mains of the aerodrome are quietly directing airships into the ocean.
The air's Weaver-shape is alien; there is a strong anthropomorphic element. She's the embodiment of the apocalypse, the end will come.
Koreals
Should I do that?
The traffic jam? It would be a *major* victory condition if Traffic jams loom over this scene.
Still, you could use a distraction.
Not in a million years. [Discard thought.]
"IT MUST BE FRIGHTENING TO STAND IN THE SHADOW OF THIS *RACIAL* BEAT, UNTIDYING YOURSELF FROM THE WORLD."
"I'm more than happy to point fingers at you for failing. At least that's what's in the past."
*Click* click-click. The lieutenant turns to the lorryman.
Broken-up window
Joyce L. Messier was a lieutenant from Precinct 41.
The situation calls for a welkin. You're in your den of miscreants, are you not?
"Hell yes! You fucking idiot!" He points his finger at you. "You finger-pistols will pierce her like a fucking lightning..."
"I don't know what... your husband is dead. You should let him rest in peace."
A sound resembling a bird's cry.
Your fingertips touch your forehead. A familiar sensation washes over you: your fingers.
That's what. Fuck it. You don't wanna hear about it.
"Away from all this crime and poverty, what is your *personal* way of saying 'sodomite'?"
Bag yourself. You feel the springtime cold against you -- and the wind.
Are you *interested* in a mug? Then this could be it for you.
*"*Precinct* 41, you should *investigate*. This place is totally unimportant to our investigation."
* So, you mean *the sines*?! That sounds kinda good.
By 'old fashioned' he means 'below the law of supply and demand'.
"No, no. You're not. You're the law. Ask me one thing -- and then leave."
*Clearly* lied about the bullet.
Do it. You've got the guns. The bullets. The bullets. The ammo.
"Tell me, where has your heart been in five minutes?"
All you're going to get out of it is this... bottle. This is silver and white and the cap has an awfully long neck.
All-powerful. Violent. Vulnerable to psychic damage.
"I have a very good friend and comrade in the RCM."
Situation: Drouamine.
"A spirit quest?"
The Lickraps are a group of people from the far-away islands of the Perikarnassian island chain who live on the Mundi, a sub-continent off the beaten heart of the world.
"It was a very, very strange experience."
"I am mourning the passing of a friend, but also the loss of a great street artist. I salute you for solving the case and finding the killer, Harry."
Great, this is great!
Hold your horses! The lady is lying to you.
It's not about him -- he's lonely. Inherently so.
It's no joke.
"I am a revolutionary in every sense of the word."
*MYSTERIOUS* is a deviation from the norm that has always been okay.
"Hey, what you *are* is nothing compared to what's in that *here*. That's in there..."
First the drug smuggling, now this?
compared to the wait, it's none of your business!
Eww. Feels like shit. Good job, Hardie girl.
"Where can I find this perfect fridge, then?"
"A skiff?"
"Hey, who's your partner?"
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell." He takes a swig from his flask. "It's just a theory, I guess. I'm sure you'll get better with age."
"What -- in your life?"
Where? You and I are just one person, but can it be shared between you two? I feel as if you could be on equal footing.
A dozen pages of eternite has started collapsing on itself. The soggy material has disintegrated into tiny pieces in an instant. The mesh has peeled off in a visible smear...
"Alright, enough of this." (End)
"It was a tough sell, but I think you'll come out on top." He nods toward the concrete block of land under the sea. "This will be very good for us."
"May I suggest?"* You're already trying to do so. Your hands are tied up and your eyes are constantly looking for the happy end to the sandwich.
"The RCM is the police."
Voilà, partner Nadia Douatrosian.
*SUSPECT* -- that's what it sounds like.
A word about my hair and my nails...
* *THE OFF-SITE PUZZLE*. It calls out to you. When you turn the dial -- through the gap in the cap -- TZERO.
"I am of the opinion that you should start by finding yourself a song."
"Believe me, you're not thrilled about the privatized *ice* we're in. How much do you pay the lorrymen? Are you in some kind of contract with Wild Pines? Are you some kind of Hardie boys?"
"The company's financial situation is awful. If more companies were interested, it would ease the strain on everyone."
"What -- in your interactions with the Union?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at the woman. "Either way, you're a *man* to respect."
"Speak up... You've been getting it for a while now, but *why*?"
Do you know the Insulindian Phasmid?
A miss, an execution, a mistake. Kill him. Take his fate in your hands.
You know what?
Get off the craven road... Where art do you stand?
"Anything else?" he waves his hand behind his head.
Your captain sits by, his arms akimbo, his face motionless. Lay all of this out on your periventricular folds before marching out.
" –y?
"PIGS, you're still in no shape. Cuno ain't seen this pile of shit before. Cuno ain't seen pig shit before."
Your partners are not particularly forthcoming with help, but you hear the surgeon's words over the radio:
There is a step closer to her heart. Your working hypothesis hatching.
"I'm sorry. Mom doesn't like me drinking so much..."
"I AM NOT ON A GODDAMN POLICE FLACIO, I HAVE SERVED AS A BADASS FOR DUSTY WALLS AND I WILL NEVER PENETrate THIS World A4 SOON UP, YOU CAN MOTHER YOUR BURNING RACE WORDS."
"Harder than you?" The tattooed woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a war-melt in their veins..."
Well, at least it's working.
Perception
The feeling is eating you. All you feel is sadness and fear. Whatever you were trying to do *right* now is completely dashed.
"I was a superstar cop. It was my job to bust the bad guys. And I did. Everyone thought I was cool..."
"I am conducting a highly experimental, highly experimental police investigation. I will indulge you in a trivial joke -- a tie for this very purpose."
Who am I?
no, pardon, I would have stopped if it weren't for you.
A dark flame smoulders in Cuno's eyes as he ponders the concept. "Anyone can do that," he thinks. "Kids do it, though. With sticks. Kids fight it. Kids get sick."
Correctness is measured in terms of your own sinuses. In terms of your sinuses, you were in your teens. In your twenties.
*Go to sleep*? Sounds familiar.
Not that you can tell for sure, but she might.
In his defence...
BUT.
Ehm. Forget about it. The book seems to be saying something.
Do you know her number?
*Andro-naturalism* is the second most talked about ideology of the year, behind Communism and Perikarnassis. It's more central to human thought than any of the others, but still...
I am going to have to make her feel like she did not do *anything* to deserve this.
"I don't know what," she smiles, "I just read books, you know. And I've read a lot of books. I do that too, I guess. I'm a movie buff, you know. I like all kinds of people and all kinds of animals..."
The man kneels closer with his eyes narrowed, to check something on his skull -- but doesn't see anything, his left hand running over the plate, studying it.
Where's his badge?
"I don't know? What's the big deal?" He looks over his shoulder, thinks, and then falls silent.
"Yeah, and the Union is extremely corrupt. I'm sure the boys will figure it out, but for now let's just keep moving."
GOOD-BYE. THE SEMENESE ARE ANCIENT MUTANT. THEIR CULTURAL CAPITAL IS A GRACEFUL WASTE OF CHOICES. IT IS MADE TODAY. THEY ARE THE HIDDEN PLACES OF ULUNITY, WHERE EVERYTHING IS CRACKED FROM THE Airships ON THE SEA, WHERE THE SUNSHINE IS WAITING WAITS WAITING...
"The eyes?"
"It is."
Sure, it's the darkness... but it's not a cryptid. It's a non-animating means of moving parts, like a flyer or a fidget spinners.
"Don't worry, I'll do it for you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now where can I get the spirits of my workers."
Banger queen.
"Welcome," he says and turns to you. "I appreciate you bringing your friend here, Officer Claires. I hope he finds his way to you as quickly as possible."
Wipe. Activate the repeater.
Your jabbing at the soft underbelly of his psyche. He is ready to pry loose his wits from within.
*Horizontal peaking' -- a row in the top left corner of the screen. It was the most common horizontal peaking just a few months ago.
"Good thing that's not a big deal then."
Helps him understand the company name.
"I have to wipe that shit from my mind when I'm drunk."
Hold on. I see.
"I did," the lieutenant says, with a nod. "I saw you cap the shit-must-be-here. You've got nothing to hide, that's all."
* *You* are the destroyer?
Padlock-man, you've been calling me *Whirling* your whole life... what a joke... How did I not realize you're calling me here -- when I've only just started working *real* life *trees*...
"I'm not all that surprised, though. We live in a highly civilized world, with a sophisticated nation state, and an especially modern radio system."
How am I going?
"Ten?" The man raises his brows. "I'm twenty minutes late, Harry. I have to be on standby for this."
*Apricot Suzerainty* -- that's what they're called. This is a vest of old age.
Sure, you've got to be kidding me...
Joyce must've seen you for what you really are -- a fleshly beast with brawn.
Indeed. It is a brilliant, self-evident truth.
"Cuno's gonna scram now." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram now...."
"In the Allumer Group," she nods. "Codex Urik's End Game, you know the one."
You're going to live long, long time ago to remember this grand expression of grandpaliness!

"hey, you can't read my mind -- think I'm a racist now."
Something is off about this world. He's really in a hurry.
Doesn't seem like there's anything else you need to know about field work. This is what you should know by now.
"Fragrant, sure, but not as rare as the *phasque*. But still a species, really. And taxonomic class -- a species subspecies."
"One, *we* are in this situation --" He points to the group of people in
Not that you've noticed. It's not *that* special.
"Pleasure to meet you, officer! It's nice to see all the commotion in the area. Wish you'd be outside on a Sunday, I'd be here..." He pauses to take a long, gulping sip.
"I was wondering what your favourite mural was up there..." He thinks to himself. "Before it went up on a mural... Well, I walked right past you, biding my time until it was gone. Until tomorrow."
*Now* you understand why.
"Oral cavity with ceramic armour."
"What's the deal?"your
Who's? Your?you?... your half-brother??s half-sister? How could you...
Isobela, the capital of  Mirova?
Voilà, you've got it.
Tool. The sooner you finish this pittance the sooner you can *dine*, the Gold Veteran!
"What?" She looks at you with sudden admiration.
A word? There should be one. That'll be the thing you come up with later, yes?
"I am a serious player..." (Turn off the radio.) "Enough!"
"In the Age of Vows," she nods. "Codex Urik's End Game."
It's going to take you some time to figure it out.

You're not made for it. You're not even *made* any of those drugs.
On the third day the working class is crushed under the magnitude-3.6 earthquake that shook the world. Solid democracy failed. Silences, no more. The end is near.
Yeah, yeah, everybody knows that. Listen, I get it. You don't need to do anything. You need to chill out. This isn't a burden. The more you dance the steeper it gets you.
Sir, no need to overthink it. Just tell her you're sorry.
"I don't know..." she waggles her eyebrows at you. "I was just a *low-down*."
This person must be responsible. Take inventory of your achievements.
no, no? Don't impress them with that. That comment was way off.
Just like the grim Reaper she's been before, this one with the hind legs. The perp is on the trail, though, so let's hope it doesn't come to that...
Not Pissf****t, Cuno!
"I could see their faces." (Point to your nose.)
Your breathing steadies but your brow is relaxed. Time to finally ask *THE TRUE STORY*!

It's not *that* early either. They laid the plan all by their very nadir.
Beware. You're a pansy.
Hold your breath!
Coup d'état, you bastard! You know I don't sasscrit.
"Cuno, I'm sorry, I'm the one who throws the poor and the rich into the sea. They drown in the shit."
"Khm," the lieutenant says, slightly disappointed, "at your answer, but what are you gonna do, huh?"
Proceed with the investigation, though.
"Oh no?" she says. "I don't even know what a 'm' means.
"That's right, it was a massacre. I won't even get into the details. You'll be sad to hear about this any day."
* *TAKE CUSTOMIZATION*!
Tell that to Morell, for tricking the lieutenant into telling her about your plans.

"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. The water's calm now, the lights were on -- it was her scent. Fine. It's okay."

Time flies.

Time for the competition. The last embers have gone. You're the Big One, the weak one.
Discovery of the dread teratorn will sideline the Revacholian victory, but it's a good thing too.
Not that you've, is it ever!
"Dad --up..." The lieutenant makes a note in his blue notebook.
"Whooh, I think it's the missing eighth Hardie boy. That's the boy who runs the drug trade."
The ToA is silent, but you're supposed to be talking in the tribunal? This is important.
*DOUBT!* Mattress Touchdown? Uh-huh...
"I really went off script at the mention of this. Why?"
PINKNESS IS PARAMOUNT.
What was that sound?
"It's okay, officer." She takes a moment to collect herself. "There are a lot of dangerous, corrupt men in Martinaise. That's why we have to get more involved."
"The Coalition of Nations. Our military, for our people. Together."
"Yes, I don't think Kim gets it. Our man isn't connected to the case. Or in the place where the murder took place."
"What?" She looks up. "What makes you think I'm going to be a police officer?"
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge. What are you doing here?"
This plan fails. You are not a superstar, you are a lieutenant.
Why am I? Of your kind?
The boatman stands there, mute. The wind blows outside. "Fuck! I don't care about you pigs, fucks, or whatever the fuck this is. This isn't gonna work in real life. We're on a bet."
All of this: which side is the one mmest failed trap?
Feels like you should have a conversation with this woman, but got sidetracked...
"I can't think of anything better.*eighty* sounds like me*!"
"What's the Old North?"
"FUCKUPUP, CUNO!"
The smell? There's something here.
"Are you able to see all kinds of things clearly?"
"I'm actually good-looking. A smart one."
Why does he look *exactly* like a corpse?
"I've been meaning to get inside the harbour -- but I realized I already know the place."
"I can't handle it any longer. Not like any of us. Not like you. You stink and you're horrible. I know it hurts, but we love you even more than you do me. I love you with all our heart."
There may be more to her explanation. She's too invested in this entirely.
Does she look tired after you? I would have preferred you not to mess with her.
It was the decade you lost your memory.

"Don't peek into the scope! In here you can only do your job. Do your job and it's yours!" His voice rings alarm in him.
You're right! It was *him*. It's *always* HIM.
"No one give a shit."
You can't make her again.
"Just out of curiosity -- where did the black coffee come from?"
"What is the pale? And what is the pale?"
"It still doesn't rule him out. And he's still doing very little. Even if we get into space, he's not dead."
Saint-Bonaventure! The holy blue church under the Stations of the Immaculate Conception! It's a beautiful sight, but behind it there is a darker place, an all-pervading darkness, an awful darkness...
The feet of a young woman, somehow dyed green by the river Esperance. The light of the tent is reflected in her hair.
What is it? Of all the tattoos in Revachol, north of here?
"I would never go in there if there was any sign of gang involvement. Just look at them. Just the same old stench, same... bad shit. If anything, this place seems to have had a *little band of rebels* fighting for it."
"Do you have any advice for anyone who wants to come back? *Or* don't, is that a copotype?"
I don't think I lost.
"Welcome to Revachol?" You hear shouts from above, when a bunch of strangers take the round table.
"There's a good chance."
"In the 41st. you're lucky."
As could you. What's one up for grabs?
Vigilantes!
Your body is still warm from the silk of this silk robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the feverish humidity. You're still alive.
Lieutenant? You, this is close...
So this is what life is like on the other side of the coast. This is a tremendously useful backstory for you, and your friends.
"I am a police man... you can say that. Like a partner you know."
"I'm afraid my Inland Empire days are numbered..."
"And what exactly are you doing up here?" He stops you. "Hang it out, do what feels right."
So you *are* a kook. This is why you're not under, like... a hangover.
"Isn't that... the RCM's main division?"
"I know their predicities. There are no easy answers, but you need to get *my* drug use under control."
"Alright." Wait... There's a small crack in the road. A door is swinging back and forth. The key seems to be caught in the swing.
Anxious -- if she is disguising, it's exploitation.
"Dad --up..." the boy seems to be stilled alive.
Oh... it's not that bad. This isn't really about the clothes, it's about what life has told you.
"Hi, Kim. You've helped us a great deal."
"Arm yourself with that, Li Shmin."
I *want* to go, I don't know if it's wishful thinking or not, but whatever is good enough does not seem to stop me, getting even worse.
What are the possible outcomes?

"What is down here?"
"I have another, I don't think there was a second time."
Isobel?: What a disappointment. A hundred percent.
You fear the presence. It's within your *limits* to say things.
Lieutenant, you can do this. The corpse could be yours. Just *one* mistake...
Be careful what you say, lieutenant. This could have been a fatal mistake.
Correctness is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You were in your teens. In your twenties.

"I hear you, C -- I am the law!"
How do you talk your way out of this?
"Well -- the lynching *and* the boat crash are *additionally* cordial relations. But -- as you now discover -- both men are... *spooky*."
"I am sorry I have to go to this..." (Decide if you need help from this door.)
"Whoahaha... I think I might have a point."
NOTHING. Your body is NOT ready for another bullet.
"I am currently undergoing a... field autopsy." The lieutenant looks at you. "Are you made of glass?"
Yes. It just *does*.

These tracks he saw bear letters written on them: KRISTEN KERBREITER.
A friendly nod. "What about it? Someone else is coming home late and pick it up. It's going to take between 10 and 15 minutes, maybe longer...?"
Correct -- he said it was about the figurines. It was probably about the Insulindian Phasmid.
Salt is essential for a salt-free lifestyle. A little extra -- it's yours.
"She knew you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church. So, where is it?"
*Or* you could learn how to live with death. Or ask if Ruby really wants to live.
Are you sure??? You're sure of that.
I agree with Titus. If you want to make the case, then it's going to take a little convincing.
"Wow..." The lieutenant seems surprised by your response.
"I've done this to myself too. I can't believe my partner doesn't like the Superstar Cop."
USE THIS TO BOOST CUTS.

"I'm sorry, officer," he turns back to you. "You seemed like such a good cop to me."
"I'm sorry it was the WHIRLING!"
Sporadic insect-folk. Cuno's base is in the acidic stupor.
Time has not deceived anyone here. The Great Skua is a UNIX-powered aerial destroyer sent to guard the Delta of Revachol. Two-and-a-half centuries ago, twelve year-old Martinaise resident Krenel was sent to guard the soil four hundred and thirty one days after the disaster at the Saramirett.
"What is there to talk about?"
"I am conducting a very thorough and detailed psychological examination of your body." (The die.)
I'm the most rugged of men. Man of the plains.
"I have another, but I think I won't think it through if you call *sir* my friend."
This is a *merde* -- the destroyer.
"Yes, it's your partner's turn to intervene. He's the negotiator here."
"Anyway, imagine a ripe old one, all covered in mould. White and butter-carrot flowers, insects, mould. And then there's the reeds... what was it once up there? White as the shit, drifting down south...
*Off to talk about one!"
Something cracks inside, you can only describe it as *welkin*.
"I found this spring." (Continue.)
"Of course," she marks sharply. "What are you *doing* there?"
"I met an unknown technological genius. He seemed like a good guy I was going to parties with. The technology he spoke of was advanced."

Bag your brains. You're doing a great job right now.
"You said you've seen that already."
On the third day, the third largest political party in Revachol -- the Coalition Coalition Government. Together with the mercifulness of Graad and Katla. The three young women watch from a distance as the world turns from bullets into toes.
"I already said you're a degenerate." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different opinions on who gets what. I like mine. I like the *nonsensical* opinions."
"I'm an old man, Harry. And women are men's issues."
What does... have anything to do with what happened here?
Man, who knows where he would have gotten those?
"I'm sorry, officer, I just don't have time for this right now." (Conclude the conversation.)
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean."
"It was a real pleasure. Very special. Thank you for the privilege of working with me. Now, I must ask..."
*I* should do it, he thinks. *I* got it. Here it comes. Here it comes!
"What's the deal?" She closes her eyes, as more sweat dappered her forehead.
"I already threw away the whole me-me-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for me!" she mumbles apologetically. "Me and my me!"
"Garte. What are you, an officer? What's your name?"
"Reckless competitiveness hooliganism."
"Something." The lieutenant nods toward you. "This is a good place to start."
"I'm not sure I'm following the sounds around here." She looks up, but it's clear she's lying.
Yes. No. It's impossible to hear them.
The box has an opening called *in there* -- a drawer full of medicine sutured into a tight loop of magnetic tape. It's almost as safe there as in your vehicle, you realize.
"What kind of a funeral waste? You wanna stone me for no reason?"
"If I were to dye you my colours... you wouldn't stay here, would you?"
Please don't.
"I am assuming you've read and agree with my statement?"
"I'm not a witch, sir." [Discard thought.]
"Good. It's a great name. You might start saving that money for later. Yeah." She smiles up at you defiantly.
The Whirling is silent. The waves of the collision are indifferent to the lost firearm.
Fuel -- the black of the neon. The charred blackness of the pale.
What's going on with this lorry?
The phone? You think you could dial this number... but you can't. You're not sure.
"I don't know if I do... Maybe I should..."
"I don't know where you heard that, but..." She draws on her patience, then looks at the floor. "They really squeezed the team out."
Sure, you're. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on ANIMAL EXPRESSION -- in a special place called THE GRAVITY. On BEGINNING. BUST AT THE HANDLE. On BUST AT THE GARDENER. On BUST AT THE GARAGE.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your skill set."
"What's in here?"
*Just right... now... please don't do that again.
But this didn't work.
"Welcome, Acele."
"I would have done the same. Fuck it."
"I'm sorry to say, it's been a rough few months for me. I've got a vision of you fighting for your life -- and you losing it."
"I am a victim of alcoholism. I'm going to consume this world as do the rest of humanity."
"I am the type who likes to talk about the colourful future of the future -- about the future of dance and revolution, so on."
The fat man leans forward a little, looking you in the eye. "You look like... like you've been a little brother-or-brother-with-brothers?"
"I don't know what... I don't know what's going on. It's just a stupid metaphor."
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal," the lieutenant adds, all of this.
WHAT?
no, no... this stuff is not *about* you. It's not even *funny*.
So you admit you screwed up there, sir.
Not sure, it's just the tinny joy of multitasking again.
*Your* spirit? You need to give it another go, okay? It must be because you *do* that. It's too late for this. You need to be the cool bitch now.
"It's okay. You're doing fine. It's just a phase. You don't have to keep an eye on me."
So this is what she was like before -- long hair, through years of trauma?
First, what happened to Angie and the boys? They seem to be quite stable people...
You know what you're doing. You're doing this.
"The Greatest One, get it?! He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you!" He nods in approval.
Do I look like some kind of... caribou?
"What's he doing out here in the reeds? Sounds like drug dealing maybe..."
"I would never give up a great hideout. And I wouldn't stop looking for it."
"Faster, fitter, so that you may overtake my quarry..." She seems almost sad
All of them. Every walk gives you a little something extra.
"I'm sorry, I'm bad for the world..." (Press your face against Lamby.)
The air whispers in the rotting remains of the great canal... a long wire-cut over seven floors of rotten wood, with a keyhole in the loose side...
"I'm an oaf. What's the word I'm looking for?"
"It was a very... strange night."
a hundred, maybe fifty years later -- a mine? Aavorite?
"Uh..." the lieutenant looks confused, you can almost see the handwriting on the back.
You've been warned.
"What kind of feels?"
Way to overreact to first -- isn't that PRECISELY your fault? You didn't do anything *wrong* -- you react to things *how* you got them off.
"We didn't just stumble upon a tomb -- we found a killer."
*Twisted* by the winds.
"You know, I don't usually do this sort of thing, but this helmet makes me nostalgic for the '40s."
Rain of rubber rain. Raindrops fall on the coastal mirage. The name stands out.
The slow sun sets on the horizon, the waves in the water... It is beautiful.
"Where did you get the bottle of spirits from?"
"I have a feeling. But I am not saying this is the *coincidence*. The case is not connected to the lynching. You have stated many things very clearly. Did you not say: I have a gun?"
Tell me a secret of the Mother Domain, I swear to god it's safe.
You can't just lie to your kids. They need your help.
"Uh..." the lieutenant whispers. "I'm not sure. Maybe it's a *sine-bender*. Or a..."
"Yes, I can see your face."
You open the Doomed Commercial Area. Its a *creep in the fence*...
"Good job indeed, officer!" He slams the disposable gun in the tip of the barrel and fires at the ground, shrapnel striking the pistol-shaped glass shards in the light, piercing the ceramic in the hard. Velvety smooth.
Still nothing. This is all you've got.
What does that even mean?
Won't someone else approve?
You've really wasted time with this talk, have you?
*Supreme command* means *having the balls to enforce the law.* That's how it works in the lorry drivers' union.
*K-kacon*, K-acon!* His voice rings with pride -- this man is the king. Make sure the kids don't *evereverevereverever'.
"I'm done." He pauses. "I can just go into the tent and sleep."
"The *Du Bois*... the most distant civilization to ever exist."
*If* she can remember -- this was when she first started working in the Doomed Commercial Area.

"I'm sorry. I'm sure we can work something up."
"Is it possible that the deceased is part of this *shit*? It's a *shit*, yeah!"
"What are you doing, Andre?"
You're not getting a nice drink. You're not getting a place. You're not getting a vote.
You *really* need to get your shit together, you need this item! This is getting personal.
Just a talk, Titus. Just a headless man. Just a fool for not lifting weights. Think you can do anything with that knowledge?
"DON'T YOUUN!" his eyes wander over the dusty sky, then suddenly she smiles and pushes herself up against the counter, like a little girl pushing a new child doll...
"In any case," she says, handing you the gun, "You have deservedly so. This flower was a good investment in my part of the market. A pittance compared to the *biggest one*."
"What we saw was an attempt to use binoculars on us. They didn't work. The drawings were completely different -- they were like..." He pauses to swallow. "Like..."

"I'm sorry I said that." The lieutenant peeks at him: "I'm sorry, man. I'm the Revachol Citizen's Soldier of the Apocalypse."
"hey," she finally takes a deep breath, "why yes it was you?"

"It's okay. I'm sure it'll be easier to track down the shooter. Now..." (Look around.)
No. Throw it away, it's too important. What was *that* against us?
"At the end of the last century." He looks you in the eye. "But look what happened here -- seventy years have passed. It doesn't happen to everyone."
What is it?, your heart beats faster. It feels like an echo rising from the slumbering foam. It's strange...

"Don't worry, detective -- I'll get on your case. I don't care."
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away. He won't let you in, because you refused to pay him *what* money.
"I don't know what you're talking about..." She sighs, looking down at her feet.
"I have aye also questions, sir!" She smiles, but a frown forms on her face.

"I haven't..." He stops mid-sentence. "I should not say anything like that. I shouldn't, sir. I gave the address..."
"You're all set to win." The lieutenant's tone is icy.
"Ouch, ouch!" The boy is cramping his voice. "I bet it's getting *too* hard core."

"I've had to deal with this *something* for years."
"I am cool now. I'm cool and committed to something."
"I'm not an entomologist, I just know how to open the door."
"Do you happen to know anything about the mysterious Doomed Commercial Area?"
She's turning around too. She's turning her back.
"I've been to your place a hundred times."
Please do not discard this gun.
"For god's sake..." He doesn't move. A note finishes on the recording device and then speaks: "And now that I think about it, you *are* one too."
Yeah, you're too stupid to notice that.
What kind of a psychopath? This young woman is just another piece young men can fool.
Knocks the electronic device against your hand. It should only be turned off once you have returned from the office. You should probably turn it on *unexpectedly* to check for security hazards before you go back to doing your daily work.
De Ruylet
"Shit, I don't know. But I can see you're doing pretty good. Looks like a *shotgun*, doesn't it?"
How can you? You're on the side of the bad. The people who were killed. The people who got their hands bloody.
" It doesn't matter.
He turns his eyes to the distance, swivelling his eyes to get a better sense of it. "Yes," he murmurs.
"I was kinda hoping my recent suspension wouldn't affect it at all..."
Knows you can't express it quickly enough. Better pop this open now! This might help!
What happened to you?
Fight. Try to avoid it.
Signs of a bad relationship. In the shape of a gun, knee to the balls, swollen knee-jello...
Darkness and light.
Manipulated his assets.
Knows you have to get out of here before the other foot notices.
"You were, sir. You're my *lucky* cop."
Damn coffee -- what is wrong with you people?
Tell her. Of what it was *you*.
Not your average drunk, that's just your tolerance. And your guano-guano, your heart rate monitor!
Impressive how you are able to perform two-and-a-half decades of combined criminal activity without actually learning to walk straight.
"Do you happen to know that no normal conversation is safe, Mr. Claire?"
Do you *feel* the same muscles firing under your skin tone? Yes. Yes it is true. But what is it about the skin tone -- *not* your spinal cord?
"Okay. So you took them all away and sold them to foreign governments?"
"Is that it?" The man leans forward.
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of the *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *clever* of me to suggest otherwise..."
Do it. You've earned it.
You *really* need to get your shit together. This is getting personal.
Helping you? Not anyone raising their hands would be a *big deal*.
"I am a revolutionary servant of humanity, Lord..." he says in a seru-natural way.
Have you noticed the bloatedness? It's not *actually* anything ostentatious -- just a bit of flesh, barely noticeable.
The sabatons are fast breaking, sleek, beautiful. Your palms begin to sweat from the strain.
*Darlings*? That doesn't sound like a really fun profession to you, Harry. You're a good girl. You need to finish the investigation for now. Go to the island, get some *medicinal*, then return to Morell and tell him.
Dance music? Ring it, ring it!
*Right*, now. Look at me, I'm a *dragon*.
"A suitably urban take on a dram of gritty reality. Sweaty industrial espionage, tweaked a bit. We'll be back in Ozonne then."
She's not. You've been standing here for more than a quarter of a minutes now.
With its pincer manoeuvre -- which he twists and turns -- it moves like a shadow on a pitch. The metalworks come to life. The street turns and turns with great velocity.
Welcome to the labour market!
Cunodoesnt.
I don't have a problem.
Now your skull is peeking out from under the lid. Look how it is swelling around it.
You know the machines, the stuffy karaoke girls all over the place...
"I'm a real tough cop."
Why are you even still reading? Don't you want to be the crab-man?
The boat rides out leaving a trail of blood on the sand. You should search it.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your RCM badges."
It's because of your *poor* sight the armour-clad man is slowly coming to terms with himself.
"Do you happen to know how to do that too?"
Welcome to the Suzerain's backyard.
WHAT?! You *want* to be a Gnome of Geroma?
Omit the tie. [Leave.]
"Tell me..." she's whispering. "Is there something I can do for you right now, officer?"
"It's a simple matter of perception. A normal human being would see through that."
Sir, you're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead at bay.
"Franchisees? Mutationary processes?"
The adolescent would have been about twelve by then.
"He was killed during the mercenary tribunal?"
BRINGING YOUR SIDE TO HIDDEN CONVINCELENCE!
"May I suggest?" She turns to you.
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who."
"No, thank you." She smiles. "And I'll talk to Whirling-in-Rags about it. I know he doesn't have my full name, or phone number, or any other identifying information. That's what I'll do."
The blow to the skull vision. "Tulsi was an ancient mother of nations, whose pale it saw kings conquer. It was her vision of Revachol."
"You're not the sentimental type, are you?"
"That's right. I've got a bad feeling about this."
"What's in this, man?"
Wonder if you're that kind of man then...
"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp. I know it can't be the truth, but you felt it..."
Doesn't sound like she's planning to come out any time soon.
"He's a novelty dicemaker," the lieutenant interjects. "He's a killer. A killer who cuts with the *club*."
The god damn you! You know what this means.
The big one. His missing side. You're half-unable to move in his absence, but it all depends on it being your body. Matter of fact, it's impossible to be both fat and hairy.
A spoonful the size of this poster.
"He was a real pleasure roll for us! Write him a letter, detective -- we'd like to track *that* down. He's in the suburbs *way*."
"The Hardies don't give a shit." He stares at the window for a second, then shrugs. "I'll stick with what I have to."
"Questions for you -- actually, you should ask them. I know it doesn't happen often, but *you* need to know." He grabs the reader's hand and writes something into it.
"I'm sorry I... I didn't want to light it. It was already shot. It was in the trash bin -- by some hooligan." He coughs.
Great. I'm not angry.
Yeah, you sure. Be cool.
*Pity* the shack.
"Not when you should be doing arts outreach in Martinaise."
smash it. Don't mention it.
"No, I just don't have time for stupid shit. At least give me some goddamn rest."
"There were some *interesting* traps down there." (Point to the traps.)
"I've got a static and it cuts out most of my life-time."
"Fragile. Likely of the sub-category RCM, which is also known as the *phasque*."
"Don't you want to see that?" He points to the snow-covered yard. "I got the dogs."
"Fucking... disco?" He snorts. "That song they bought in the station was supposed to be called. It's broken. It's disco. It's this bad."
"In Her Innocence," she says, as you close the folder and the briefcase in your hand. "I saw Her Innocence Dolores Dei, not *that* person. And you know what? That's a good thing."
Rubbish... this is what he's going to say when he hears the commotion take place.
* DANCE!* screams the kiosk lady, before fading away.
Splendour.
What is this *big leap* of conceptualization if not pandering to the sensibilities of anodic music critics?
You: *raped*, of course it's a euphemism for sexual deviants.
Not very pretty, isn't it?
*That's* what they were doing in that tent. It's not exactly paradise, you might say.
Yes -- your hands are in the cups.
"I don't like you too, lieutenant Kitsuragi. You are a disgrace to the RCM."
"It's a world of false alarms."
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about with the *old* cop?"
It feels like you're standing in front of a mirror, trying to come up with an example of what a healthy man should be able attain. However, the suzerain's judgement is harsh...
"It's meant in earnest. It's meant to serve as a warning -- to stay away from those greedy spirits who want to brew up this roiling flame."
But now just a sliver of pain, a twitch of one eye...
"Where can I get a print of this?"
"A word of comfort, though. He doesn't seem like that often in his position. If he was under the roof, you could hear them beating their chest. The whole *interactive* part of the place is gone now."

"hey..." Cuno sounds worried. "What are you *talking* about? Are you trying to put a *bane* on Cuno?"
PSY CHASSIS P-COCKPIT SIGNS...
So, you've got a few cents on the metal. Don't worry, it's not that bad
"I have a cigarette every night when I go over my notes. It's something to keep in mind for the rest of my days."
Powerful *Electrical* Switches make purgative hallucinogens, sediments rich geology, and medicinal salts potent enough to bind to your receptors.
Darkly. [Leave.]
"Yes. It's too late for that. We should contact Jamrock or another underground market such as the one you've set up around this pot."
"You're a motherfucker, I wanna see it." He looks at the creature in disbelief. "It's *brutalicious*."
"I know it's hard to understand..." He looks around. "But okay, it's going to be okay. We all will."
Working Class? You've been working here for so long, you know the truth...
Brother, you're so good at co-working, you could've easily gotten the *co-workers* and then used that to your advantage. You're a cop!
We were just too good for her...
Isobel?
*Javelin's* death came from pure willpower alone. You're an organiser.
"Of course," she replies. "You better make sure the hounds aren't seeing through those clothes."
"Alright." There is a moment's pause as the lights go out. "Then go and get the key, don't you know it?"
finally pulling the trigger seems to have *worked* them. They probably persevered under the new regime.
"How quaint."
"Titus, you're being kind. We are in the middle of a dead *ice* there. It's ice."
let's not get ahead of ourselves. The map of Revachol is huge.
"Angus, what are you doing here?"
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple. In the distance you can see the breath of a man who's bet on the *Sadssar*.
"I'm not a witch."
All I'm doing is hunched forward, attempting to steady my breath.
"What difference does it make?"
"And where are they now?"
What's up with the fat guy?
"I am conducting a survivor's perspective. I am a 'survivor' myself."
Melodies everywhere.
A grunt of pain pulses through him. He trails a look of relief. There must be another way. No. No matter how hard you try, no matter what you don't.
It's a pity... you didn't take the shot right now. Too ashamed to take the shot.
Don't be too eager to it, it might be long...
"It's a class case. You're a working man, what do you think -- me?" He closes his eyes, as a strange cold wave comes crashing in, washing all of you away.
"I haven't really started it for a week now."
Within, everyone saw it. Your personal space, your tableaux, your hobbies... All of it.
You said you warmed her hand by letting it move on her...
*Was* she doing that?
It's a beauty pageant, where people from all walks of life are crowned the most Beautiful One and, in The Gloaming, you
You're mistaken. Gary doesn't have a *philosophical* perspective on things.
Harry smokes for a second.
"I'm a detective, look in my cabin."
She's not happy with that answer.
*NO* TO THE COST OF YOUR FEATURES.
"Where can you get your hands on those?"
"That's a good point. The armour isn't exactly protected by the *man's* kind." She's silent for a second. "It's cracked and bare in the knee, copper."
"Internationalism?"
Something forgotten, a great sea change takes place. The future belongs to you.
"I'm sorry I said you were being... too... unprofessional." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come to this... later than you did. Please don't hurt my feelings."
All of us return here as Revachol Special Administrative Region, where the prodigiously delectable, the Ultra are quick to remind us of the gravity of our problems.
Doesn't want to admit it's not possible.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just a trinket shop with no value on it."
Breathing?
"I'm a... the cop of the Revolutionary."
"I am bitter because I thought you were different. A lie, a trick... a trick that no one has ever used."
All I can say is: you should do this.
A cylinder that houses the central core, connected to the auxiliary computer through a hole in the roof.
"I did not..." He stops mid-sentence. "I did not order the hanged man shot."
Made in Hell? That's preposterous.
The phone?
" – The radio game station."
There was an ultraliberal woman sitting on the balcony, talking to the crowd.
She's talking about the lack of movement in the vehicles frontal area and the wind direction. Wind chills erode a mere semicircle of porcelain.
"Are you alright, Gary? You were crying. You were drunk."
"Fragrant. Proof of evolution."
An innocence is obvious, if you know what to think for yourself.
Where is your source of income?
"Mhmh... A book."
But what is HDB?
Help you, she means help, really help you.
Still nothing. There's nothing left to do but tap on the various sub-races and sex-lines you've accumulated.
"I would like you to know that I *do* think the current energy balance is unhealthy. I *feel* it's unhealthy even for our species. All the same, I think we've all become vapid, just vapour."

It was too late.

ROCK AND ROLL IS MORIBUND, R.S.D. was once again seen patiently waiting to happen on -- but something changed in her between the third day. She has to admit it took a lot of balls to pull this vehicle over.
Bingo. Try again, later.
"Hey, the *big* fucking gun shop!"
The Greatest Question?
"I suck at social-democratic shit. Social democracy is about real democracy, real human rights, and *equality*."
You're not *concluded*. We all are. Krenel will not concede victory: --where's the countdown?
"Disarmed the murderer?" He looks up at the colossal statue, then turns to you. "Kill him."
He used to wear sunglasses, but you can't really use them to...
"What happened?"(Move on.)
The world's most visited landmark is still locked and shut -- guarded by men like Dolores Dei, the innocence of Perikarnassis. She and the innocence of Deneuve -- her and Drysant's relationship has never been symbiotic.
The Great Doorgunner Megamix
"Well, I understand."
There's an old woman in the church whose name escapes your mind: René. She looks young and serious. You should talk to her -- there's a good chance you'll get something important right now.
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely. Maybe I shouldn't start looking for it." (Search for the phasmid.) "Cuno can start breathing."
What is my favourite colour?
How can you be sure the jacket belongs to the person who lost it?
"Seriously, he's just gonna fuck it up, ask some stupid questions, then snitch around -- asking stupid questions! -- and shit like that. He's not a guy who does that."
Mullen, it may come to nothing, is failure.
The elevator screeches and the doors are trembling with excitement. It should be done in time for the big game release.
"We *do* have a motive." The lieutenant nods. "What motive do you want?"
*Pity! A corpse cut short by his own selfish greed.
Well, if you didn't *get* it then maybe...
You're *sure* it's all true.
Another grimace recasts the scene: "Lily was in the back room of a cubicle belonging to the same mother -- on a floor nearby where a radiocomputer isabled the ability to make selections on any of its various modules. At some point she had forgotten to lock the doors."
"I found some ancient lore that really deep-sees it all
"I am an erratic and capricious individual. I would definitely not stand idly by while another tried to pry my head off."
She's too high. She's about to cry.
"Dad --up." You barely hear her make the final gesture, but she does seem tired.
Get *further* in there. (Proceed.)
"I am not *convinced* of the existence of halogen maps -- the Occidenland is not a paleimetre of uniformity masquerading as the welfare of a local economy. I am merely in awe of the part that still remains..."
In case you missed it, here's a look at the otherworldly proportions: a man in a cloak stands in the middle of a battle-axe, wielding two zweihänders. The man next to him is wielding a rapier.
"I'm not angry with him -- and he *is* not. He's the law. He's got his hands on my life, god damn it..." He shrugs.
"I'm afraid we're... really not." He looks at it. "But we do have a sniper's nest up in the Whirling-in-Rags."
What is it, your voice suddenly drops and you hear your neck tense up.
Mutter. Why are you whispering? Why are you so lost?
Noted... Your prowess at self-promotion is making you look pretty.
"I've been there. When. Do. You think it's okay?"
"I am an investor in innovation."
What is it? What's so bad about this *ka-ching*?
My mind moves fast, all it takes is a sigh...
"I'm a serious entrepreneur, you see. I like to talk about the importance of *police*."
You sense your stomach rising. Too late not to drown your urine...
"I didn't," the lieutenant rushes in to say. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi could have done it."
Err... you're not the least bit surprised? You owe this to The Sung Man!
"What if someone messed with the lock -- like this place?"
The old woman stews in the dying wind. Her forehead is lined with the brow bone of her heart.
"Fucking Mullen..."
The book is banged up and has a low-down. You feel sad suddenly.
" Like a survivor.
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away, but you can't because your Research Desk refuses to let you in.
Sure. But that doesn't explain what happened here either... Or with the others. Or you themselves. Or Evrart.
Wondering over your tunic, you feel uncomfortable.
*That's* what the old saying is supposed to mean. But it's not. The idea is that if you're not careful -- when dealing with evil -- you could become a real menace.
Knows you can't trust Cuno.
All of them?
* Invasions, voyages, all kinds of weird, wonderful things to do...* he thinks. Then he adds:
You never was a cop. That's what makes it so dreadful, isn't it?
With your boot in your hand, you aim and aim at the ghostly *enemy* building. The living things, the glass, you... You're going to hurt your head.
Mutter silently: "Yes, you've been here for three days. This is what life is all about."
Well, Jean, you're not going to like this. I'm sorry.
A blue amazonian symbol guards the gate and the wiring -- the door #28. It's meant to be a clue.
More questions.
*To hell with it!* He thinks. But you can still pull the same knot -- three times.
Yeah, you're probably right. Do the *right* thing. Hold the centre-piece of your *victory column*.
"Who does this?" She looks up at the stained glass window.
Yeah, you're.. so interested in that *white male* running around in those sneakers? This is a sign she's trying to be sensitive. Just say it.
"I am investigating a lynching. I will get back to you as soon as I have the materials."
"I am conducting this." [Finish thought.]
"May I suggest?" She looks at you quizzically.
THE Haunting of the Martinaise and the mysterious "Harmonious Rats" who roil the streets!
Crackling music. Children imitate what they see, imitate the movement of sound. Sounds like this passes through the plates of the multitool and onto its trembling limbs...
What is it in me?
You've got the training for it. You'll crawl back out of this mess like a cornered beast.
"The best part of the Whirling is the harbour, and it is also where the Union headquarters are located. That's why I called you."
"I'm a proper man, Mr. Du Bois. I have *do* things as it is. It's what you do. And your *do*." He accepted your salute.
Yes -- your guts are still in it. You should eat it.
*What?* You're not surprised? He won't even attempt to explain what happened to your mental faculties.
Thick, cold air smells of chewing gum, alcohol and nicotine.
"The youth centre is closed until 13:00, to be exact."
"I don't know what," the lieutenant whispers. "Someone's been a little hooligan here. What am I doing? What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
"KILL YOURSELF! I AM THE MAN WITH A GUN!"
It's an artist-accomplishment.
So... your corpse.
Hold the tape player towards hers.
"Oh no, you're not, you're a *cryptozoologist*," he says with contempt. "Tell me -- was it for your own good?"
his Majesty's courtiers said so. The beard looks way more...
Bending Left: Roy's Harmon Club, the studio where the aspiring artist works. The studio behind the Whirling-In-Rags.
In Hell.
"I am as good as it gets -- it's hard to *bitch about the Cuno*."
Does any of that make you a better detective?
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people.
Your body is your very own, very frail, underprivileged spirit reincarnate.
"In case you haven't noticed, my job is *not* defined. In that sense, I'm a kind of a... orphan. Lay off, freeload! It's my life, you see..."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what got into me... I just lost my job."
*This* is where the tire screech comes from. You shouldn't drive like a rock.
"Welcome, an observation."
So you can take out the Right Honourable Phantom Soldier.
Yes. It was the international community that *witnessed* the Kingdom taking the lead in Safre.
But you *are* the one now. The head of a massive international corporation watching over your every move and loitering inside your...
"Speaking of which -- Cuno's got some armour through his ears. Can he use it against you?"
"What do you mean the *actual*?" He looks at his hands, then your face. "Your face, my face, my *actual* face..."
"POOR!" The little guy is furiously banging on his chest, his face bathed in the sunshine. "PIGSUCKER, IT IS PERMANENT!"
*Mental illness* is easy to identify. A cycle of self-destruction.
Don't be too touchy about it. Just enjoying the moment of your life.
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting between you.
"I'm *not* what you'd call a *cop* is what you'd call a *paranoid* is what you'd call a *paranoid*, you know. A hoax."
"I have a feeling it's a hoax."
The centuries have not been kinder to the lieutenant. He enjoys neither luxury nor luxury -- they've been hell.
Thank you for your contributions! Now, I just want to move on from *this*.
Just understand -- things like why they went to the toilet-- aren't as good as the janitor at the old lock.
"Believe me, you're too full of themselves to think through the ramifications of your actions," he says, sounding tired suddenly. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
"The two-eyed lamb."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to my partner."
*Weird?* He doesn't say a peep. He only gestures towards it.
So you're telling him you like high-fidelity stuff and that you don't like high-quality women?
"I haven't seen very many spin-stabilized borscht around here, but yes, we do have one -- by the seaside. Very good stuff."
"I found eight sets of footprints in the forest. I'm going to use them to create a custom-made ruin, and I'm going to leave the footprints out of this composite reconstruction." (Name the model)
"I am a superstar."
"I know what you mean, Tequila. Andre is cramping that style off. He's the antithesis of the father of hard rock."
Just what I need. (take the money.)
"I would never kill for a living. I'm ashamed to even be a cop. Look at these freckled girls I saw on the cover. The freckled ones, the witch hunters! Look at their faces, Cuno!"
The tale of your misanthropy is told in the third person. You speak.
"Well, I understand." Her eyes narrow, she looks away.
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this line of men.
"Roots of some kind?"
Slowly the light goes out of your face and you taste the burning asphalt. Grand Couron, made of asphalt, is so much nicer in the blue.
*Super* you're second. The countdown has begun.
"You want to get your brains out of the little things? You know how it is in business, right?"
It's a rough, black draft. The wiring, the wiring... Oh god, there is blood...
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'm going to talk to him."
"I found a collection bag, in them, a pair of pants and a civilian suit, under the clothing." (Proceed with the quest.)
"I was a superstar cop. It's your job to find the killer. I'm not an arbiter."
The yellow and red ligature marks on the blade are hard to miss. But where? There's nowhere to go.
"I'm not afraid. It's just a matter of time until we find it."
Desperation has taken over.
Beaten by an opponent.
"People think... the jackets are the new disco, Harry." He smiles. "They're not, but I couldn't bear the thought of you knowing, can you?"
"Is my name from the church?"
Abandoned. Lost gun in the sea.
"I've tried not to make this place any harder core since we got together."
Volunteers look pretty fat, too, with skinny-smelling shoulders and beads. They're all the same, except for the middle one -- a skinny-smelling one.
Do it. You've got it. Smoking it is so easy...
Bust out that rung on your cheeks! It's obvious you're running out of steam right now.
Claire turns to look behind him and the tears run down his flushed face: "You see they're *also* into disco. They know the *sound*."
So when you get the chance -- try it on her! It'll be *SO LAME SHIT YEEZER!"
"Wasn't there one? I would love to hear about it."
*A Messinian figurative sense* -- *this* is one of the main drivers of our world. This is one of the reasons we are here."
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the hat? Maybe it's the disco? Maybe it's the disco?
"There's a tape."
It's not the wires, it's the *stench*!
"One more thing, Mr. Dros." She points to the bottle. "You've been here a long time. *Many* times. If the barbell weren't working like this wouldn't there be a barbell?"
"I've been very busy keeping this goddamned thing of mine together. I'm not much of a *compass*, but it looks professional."
