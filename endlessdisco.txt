The point of the presentation is to create a false sense of security while maintaining a level of closeness.

Your partner says your emotions are your own.
This is it. You jammed the trigger and it went off. He takes a two-hundred-and-two, nasty for the men's room! Nasty for the men's room!
*Aesthetic* is all about *attraction* -- that's what he means.
Still, what a day...
"I am intrigued -- but not obliged to share... this information with you until I've seen one of the following: the girl's real name?"
The deal? You'll never make it, no one is going to make it.
The God Himself is silent. It's like the hangover of the man on the mic, but far worse.
I don't think it's wise for me to go undercover in a police station.
"His opinion is his, mine is..." He looks to the city and looks out across the bay...
"I don't like your politics, officer," he says, raising a hand. "You're a bourgeois woman -- you're a bourgeois woman and you have a gun. Let's talk about some real work."

Where were you?
Pollen... burn.
It was in your hands.
Yes! Healed I, I, II, III pheromones!
*We* were in the right place at the right time. Let's apologize for it!
In fact... you could summon up a swarm of atoms and even their blood -- use them to launch some sort of *final* strike. You could wipe out the entire human race.
"Wow. No. What?"
"Fuck this goddamn map shit. Red carpet for the rich-guy types." He points to the two motor lorries.
"A memory? That was the first hint I got that she was in some kind of trouble with *the police*..."
Yeah, I wouldn't want that.
" -- it's not a place, it's -- what is it?"
"I found what sounds like an unused tire on the street. It's very modern, unremarkable..."
That's what the colours tell you. Time to move on.
*I*... call it a *phasmid* -- call it what you want. It's a large stick insect, with a head like that of a mesque. It's easier to concentrate on one thing and be completely silent on the other.

"It was a long time ago. She's only a stupid woman."
* ETHANOLA* sounds like a local language, and so does *EL MAR*. It's hard to make out, but you can make out some words on one side...
"Five-war-pale, white-on-blue? What's that? People in the north shouldn't be that, you know..."
It's not a worried look. She means it.
"Okay, I'm not gonna do it. You're kids -- they're only fucks. The rest of us are kids. You're damn right..." he mocks himself. "You're gonna do it, right? Because life doesn't care."

"Alright." The lieutenant glances at you over his glasses as you continue to push through the cut.
Open the plate with your hand.
Make out, purest of hearts. The longing is deep, the longing is deep... Only now let me ask...
"I am back on the scene every time someone needs help with a door. I am making a difference today."
Yeah, you're too stupid to notice that.
"I already told you, I don't want to lose my gun."
"One more thing..." (Conclude.) She turns around, almost in awe, and says: "Thank you, officer. I really appreciate it."
"I just don't. I have a whole lot of stuff in this boat."
"Tell me..." the lieutenant strokes his beret.
"What what?"
YES.
Don't feel anything. [Leave.]
You've got to the next level, you canNOT be a loser. YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT
Where am I?
"I'm sorry I don't have the money to pay for my friends, my friends... my friends... My friends..." The old man's voice drowns in a sea of pain, his lips quivering with pain.
"Cuno..."

"Is the information from the book about the fight between cops and revolutionaries just another fantasy, my liege?" She looks up at the ceiling.
*What if*?
The big guy nods. He wipes his brow. "I'm actually glad now. What was so difficult, was ultimately a matter of principle. There will be a 'boule bomb' later."
Something that could be a side-investigation.
Breathing117483745... this one's a blue dragon, emerald green. You get smaller, because you too are a blue dragon.
Patience... Do something good with this. It's a good thing you do.
"Why the fuck?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "I'm sorry it took you so long to respond. What if something goes wrong?"
You have stolen her thunder. She knows the box is big, it's big in the back, it's big in the middle, but you can't really put your finger on it.
No no no no no.
Disintegrating can be very healthful. It could drastically impact your subsequent relationships.
"That's a moment's respite..." He shakes his large head. "The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves.."
"Hell yes! You finger-pistols will pierce through the skullless chill of *party time*."
The plastic jumps open to reveal a giant turd. It's thick, like meat covered in saliva.
"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. Who you are -- this is all your fault."
Holding the power cables, I can only wonder... what secret do these cables hold?
"No matter," he mumbles, turning back to his own words: "Radio shows, music videos, the colour of his eyes... You shouldn't hold it against me, alright? Ask me anything."
So that's why he's not in the most trouble.
A sudden, violent flash of anger.
What he means is that he doesn't like the idea of your knowing that he has been drinking *all* the time.
Knocks on the windows of the kitchen.
"I am a police man. If I can help you, then I can help *you*."
"Right, officer! Looks like we're gonna have to do our best not to mention *communism* when we talk about it."
Cunofingers -- you gonna help me kill Cuno? FOREVER!!!
"Uh..." the lieutenant says, suddenly uncomfortable. "Has this been there before?"
"Aw man, look at all these..." (Point to your head.) "Who are you talking about?! Is everything alright, Kim? This is making me uncomfortable -- let's move on."

That shit ain't telling you anything!
Vigilantes? I can't be that. [Leave.]

You can't do it. The people who can't do anything are too poor to do it. You look like an *amateur*.
All you get from this oddity is utter failure and erratic movement, both of you chronically out of shape.
Hush, he's definitely done nothing!
Getting drunk is a *bad* thing. It makes you the person they say they are.
"It's a fountain ofQueso-inspired idiocy." She raises her brow.
You sense that they're waiting to see if you have any ideas.

"I've heard it was hard core. There's a great deal of strife and strife-torn stuff in Revachol West. There's a little girl living in an apartment building in the middle of a commercial area..."
BUTTER AND TARTO WHICH? You think it's good you didn't get a taste of that, the senses fear.
*Pisssssspped* is what you were doing. And it was so pretty, so pretty.
Wouldn't that be... tingling in your limbs?
"What?" the lieutenant looks worried. "None of this is essential to your investigation."
Doesn't.
There may be some other way...
"What we saw was an attempt to use binoculars on us. They didn't work. The drawings were completely different -- they were like..." He pauses to swallow. "Like..."
Knock further...
Great, we can do this.
You may want to pay attention to what the creature's half-brother is saying...
"I have no interest in dusty containers."
He truly, truly doesn't want you to know.
What's wrong? Your hands are balled, fists are ready to give up.
"A very, uhm... tragicomedy." Her eyes move between you and the lieutenant. "Hope nothing similar happens to other people, officer. Thoughts on other people are my thoughts. I'm sorry, officer, I just have to go..."
"I'm sorry. That's not the problem." (Take the matter into your own hands.)
You're not entirely sure your figurine fits the "right" way. It's either fitting or not here.

*This* is what the ancient Perikarnassians called a *grand strategy* -- using all the vicious rhetorical techniques and techniques developed over the course of their civilization.
"Cuno wasn't *talking* you into this. He's a person."
"You were wrong," the lieutenant says with a mischievous grin, "I've never seen anything like this on the cover of a magazine."
"I *could* have gone on longer. You're in a hurry -- I'm all out of fuel oil!"

"It sounds as it always does. And the world itself, just like everything else." He nods sagely. "But know that I appreciate your efforts -- and I'm looking forward to hearing from you."
"Right, and nothing else."
Not very pretty, isn't it?
Do you want to know? Immediately. It's too much.
Busted your pants.
Now come to think of it, you're in the *fine!
"Enough of it then." [Leave.]
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Pale."
About the situation?
"Funny," says the lieutenant. "That you don't like her more than you like *me*."
"Your partner? I don't see how we could have come up with that -- we're in the processing stages."
"I *have*." He looks around. "I have no part in this sad circus. I hope you understand -- you just walk out of it with *your* mouth agape."
It's so hard to know what you're talking about.
Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to proceed.
"Hey where?" (Look around.)
*Worn* underneath your clothes, mind.
Yes. Died out drinking that one.

"What you need is someone from the Coalition on your side."
"No need to take it off. It's too costly. The zipper keeps the water out. And the store at arm's length. I think it will last a lifetime."
Set your name for it.
"I haven't even heard from my mom! She's calling me a *lady*, calling her friend! She keeps me pretty busy right now."
"Is my badge real? Is it?"
I've got a terrifying necktie... and I need money.
"La vieux?"
"The Greatest Innossence is not going to happen. People are just born that way... I doubt there's anything in there that would make them respectable people."
Something's off about this.
"I just don't know what you're talking about." (Point to it.)
"Apologies, yeah. I also threw it in the trash. Look who it is." She makes a note in her little notebook. "What do you think of such a fancy titles?"
He hopes she's right. He's about to *crack* it -- now that it's settled.
"Shanky, you didn't look so good -- so pretty."
Open the drawer.
All you hear is his intonation, barely concealed by his jacket.
Project Rain for the Straight Dope Man
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is right above your scalp, just like the one in your hand.
You sense this strange radiocomputer hum. It's the sound of marching into a new era of *total war*... Or is it just the reverb of guns, bullets, and artillery fire?
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away, but you can't because your Research Desk refuses to let you in.
"I would *love* that gun." (You feel a surge of love, as if someone pulled a gun.)
"Don't squabble, Cuno!" His voice echoes in the cold air of the church.
Journalist Love?
"Frankly, it's just a waste of time." He tries to cheer you up. "You're a disgrace to the phoenix. And the man is dead."
Just like the others, these ingredients are sprinkled throughout the ingredients like fine wine to compliment and complement the food. The mesquitos and wasp ladies too.

Green from the cold. This was a net. This was used to measure the distance sent by the East wind. It should never have been left. It was left, sadly, only in the name.
"You know, it's the sound of my heels, Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor."
"Okay, I've said that." She nods. "We can talk about it. But right now let's focus on the important things first."
"Oh, *that's* right, officer. That's what I'm here for. Now please give me some more of your time."
"What now?" (Give the pin back.)
"Your *own* opinion? I don't know what I've figured out. I prefer the old man -- working for the people. I still admire the initiative and the initiative aims to bring about the end of this world."

Bystanders reported golden filaments lighting the already sunlit chamber, inviting rays. Purifying, nourishing oils.
Stories like these are not new. People have said those before -- and they're *wrong*.
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you." She takes her cigarette out of the pack. Smoke follows a small drip of tar. "It was stupid."

"What if the situation calls for a counterargument? I suppose I should find that balance perhaps..." He looks at the sword in your hand.
"I'm sorry." She doesn't seem entirely convinced, but still decides to take the offer.
"What *is* true...?"
"Good to hear that he's not going to be shy about it."

"Yes, I meet the *standard* testing and readiness period, and I'm a youth in the 45th precinct. However, if the building comes to a standstill, I may need to *reset* the generator."
"I've been really into all kinds of things."
"Where can you get your hands from?" The lieutenant looks at you.
You've opened a door in the Whirling-In-Rags. Surely you would know how to open it!
"I also saw you -- a professional gardener, living it. How did you survive?"
*And* you're under arrest for the murder.
"It sounds as though you're under some kind of spiritual stress, sir. Maybe this is why you've been avoiding it for so long..."

"I am of the opinion that you should buy all the books!"
"A hole, that's the way they *do*. Maybe you should just go back to the w√ºrm for help. It's not like you could try to sign a professional professional plate. And if you did, you'd get in trouble. Now there's trouble -- trouble of *really* long prison terms."
"I don't know who these *bosses* think they are, but I knew I couldn't leave my post here..."
"It's a good word," he agrees mostly to himself.

You've lost control on your emotions. The steering begins to feel needy. The dial switch feels strangely keyless.
Nothing to do here. He just keeps staring, impassive, out of sight...

In the shadowy cryptreogen, white spots form on the branches.
In this way she betrays me.
"I'm not sure I'm following the sounds around here."
Breathing... this spring water tears your hair.
"Do that. I need to go."
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "This man *has* entered a peaceful retirement. You should talk to him about this. This is *important*."
Not a fan.
"I also live in the shadow of the Doomed Commercial Area. A commercial area -- way inside the commercial area is a-hole."
*I* would do something any other cop. *I* would do it all right one day...
"A saved itself? Yes, it does sometimes. So we did. And I do too. I think our work here will ultimately be its own justification."
Are you sure?... You sure it was happening?
"Roon, you're the real deal. You got boots and a gun."
Siileng, Kimboutu.
*Clearly*, sir.
*Extrapolated* the age of history from the last days to the present.
"I only pray to the Mother oh Mother who loves nothing better
"It's okay, I'm not *really* interested."
"hey, who's there?" A strange machine hangs on the wall. "It's us. Oh, the feminists. The revolutionaries -- some kind of wannabe-types."
Pain shoots up your leg again, shooting up your hip and into your stomach. You swallow it, but the mass of black meat still doesn't rise up. It's hard to say if you should have more, or less...
Acting without the presence of a shadow is indescribable! This is *your* turn.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have started it.
*What do you think, Kim?!* he yells.
*The Bells* is what it is. The great, glorious, nameless mass of flesh -- stretching out on all sides, all separated from the rest of the matter. It's too sad, it too is hollow.
It's not an *am* and a a a care, is it? It's about *you*. And it's not a care either. It's lonely. Inherently so.
Claire to Revachol: 'I am of the mind and the matter standstill.'
The Wirr√¢l setting sun is almost out of focus in the dim dark of the communal bathroom. A drawer opens with a key -- a padlock. The lock clicks shut near to the lock.
"Enough with this now, I have other things to do." [Leave.]
"It's a Gambit. They make them for adrenaline. It's very effective at making you put your mind at ease, making you think..."
Bye..., you've fallen over backwards under the swaying chair!
"I don't think I want them."
Not you
"I promise, officer," he says, not once but twice. "We're going to use that tap on the core."
The East-Slovak? The most *democratic* segment of the vote. They think they're doing everything *right* by not casting a single one of theirs.
I'm talking
I feel like I've lost.
"And you're sure *you* aren't going to take it up with Cuno."
Hold your breath!
Wings concave on the sea ice, bobbing in the spring light. The lights of Rue de Saint-Ghislaine complement the murk beneath.
It *still* has all the hallmarks of a real historic figure -- and it's own name, right?
"Whoahaha..." the lieutenant squints his eyes, the wind blowing slowly. "I'm pretty sure it wasn't you. It was the locusts and the fucking fuck-boi "
"I know it's hard to admit you're a cop."
" Gaston must think he's doing everything a honourable man is *too* lavish. " He fills in the blanks, tensesually. "
All I've got to say: it's cold. And there. Coldest *cold* anyone's ever been. And coldest anyone's ever been.
Getting worried makes you uncomfortable.
You're a cop, you know?
The smell of fresh sweat, especially on your hands, is ever present in your nose.
"I've got a pair of *dead animals* lying around in the ice." (Present the fridge.)
"Ace's high!" He raises his right hand, waiting for you to slap it. "Get your shit together."
It's an older building than the one in question.
"No. No. I don't really care about politics. I don't care about policework. I care about my gun and my gun. That's all there is."
"The Glen Claire scab was one of the many failed businesses in this subdivision. It's probably still going on."
Press PRINT to exit.
"I just don't want to. Some of that old shit is in the reeds, so I *need* it." She crosses her arms.
"Do you think this is somehow connected to the case?"
This is FALN gear too. Light it up, show off, convert it into a speed****!
Working Class:? What's this?
ONLY POSSIBLE TO PERISH IN YOUR LIFE.
Why does *I* look like a *crab man right now?
All you're going to get is another shot. It's going to take something out of you -- just a little.
Read your rapist's name.
*leaderlessness*, you say?! A youth leader! And with a stick rifle! What's with the *lights* on your head, man? You're on the right track with him. HARRY!
"I already had a strange... sexual dynamic with him. We played it off as some kind of premonition -- that he was gonna go away, or maybe even a temporary blackout, or some shit. It didn't work."
The Saint-Domingue, the Old Vicar's Dancer, is a youth centre, orphanage and night club. It was once a community centre for the homeless, but that was a few years ago.
Ceau? You feel the need to cover up for your love of this? Aren't you a little close to home, really, but somehow you feel like you *don't* deserve it more than you *know*.
The thought dissipates, the cold is swept away. You look inside.
"Yes. It's the designation of your Precinct. 41. Meaning your name will be star-spangled on the obverse and a white star on the reverse."
The numbers are not there for 'you're under my control' or 'I'm under control'. These are there to set you free from all that is unattainable.
"I am contacting the RCM's database. It is sending you a message that you do not need to enter the RCM password for the task force call. Please enter the password at once."
A blood bath!
"I'm *not* gonna ask any more about that roof over there. I was just some chick in a gang -- that's it."
How can you? You're on the side of the bad. The people who were killed. The people who got their hands bloody.
"I am a police man, and not *disco*."
"I'm a contract killer. I've killed more people than any other gang in the city."
The cook gives you a strange look, her light grey eyes shining like pearls in the dark night.
Goddamnit, I should have sworn.
"Oblivion? You mentioned it before, don't you think?"
"I wouldn't be so sure." He pockets the sandwich. "But what's the most important part of your job as an officer of the RCM?"
*RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK*!
"I am conducting a thorough investigation into the bullet found. I'll pass." (Lie.)
"I've been thinking of it for weeks now. If you haven't noticed, I have a vast soul and I need you to forgive me. Until then, may you go style."
The seat is the row of your choosing -- make it yours. Look how the rows of occupants fit together in the huge weight of the chair.
"It's a little late for tears, isn't it? What a joke. Look around you..." He spreads his arms.
I don't care, I'm a joke.
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end...
"I am sorry, you can't... He wouldn't understand anything you say." She shivers. "It is very strange, Harry. He's definitely not human."
The case of your life. Men like Gaston are usually unpleasantly happy to see you. But Gaston is a *billion* re√°l*. He has no qualms about being loved. And he is *disco*.
You can't just lie to your kids. They need your help.
"Are you sure?" Her round eyes dart back and forth on the photo paper, areolate in the light of her camera.
4.1 billion years ago. There's a crown and a sceptre around her head, and a vast ocean to explore.
"He means Joyce?'
So, are you going to let me in?
Time to talk with her! Are you a seagull or a sea monster?
Guess what? The gameboard for the competitive level design process is right here! Wrong idea, wrong decision. This is what happens.
"Thanks for your time, ma'am. I'll keep it."
Goddamnit... is that face of terror you see every day -- the same face with the same faces like *eyes* on your skull? Screaming for help? Mouth hanging wide, mouth moving...
NOTY.
"These people, they're all going to die -- what do you think of them?"
"I am conducting an autopsy on this man."
Tell her. That goes without saying.
Goddamnit. Tell him.
Precisely... the *B-word* everybody thinks it ties you to this island of matter. Let's *fuck* it.
Footprints in the dust below the stench.
Much as she'd like to claim responsibility, this *grandiosity* was overstated -- she too wore an athletic tracksuit and smoked a little. She's rich.
You have an undercount. There's something there. Better not to jump to any conclusion.
"A prayer!" He laughs. "I pray for the safety of my employees and customers. They're the reason I'm in business here."
"Funk says he's a *genius* and a 'lady-bitch' for the local boys."
"Are you trying to give me money through this payment processor?"
Jean Vicquemare... who is that?
Not that you need them the embarrassment.
You: Bookmarked the moment I thought it would come? I'm totally crack as a detective.
"I was." There's a pause. "I'm not sure whether he was a reader, or a... a reader of the *web of lies*?"
Who does? This is neither here nor a good place to stay. Better head home to the other vassals.
"I've been very busy keeping this goddamned thing of mine together. I'm not much of a *compass*, but it looks professional."
"Why the fuck would he want to *promise* anything?"
"I just don't know where to find this."
YEAAAGH! FURY YOUR MIND!
"Cuno's gonna hang you, pig. Pig's got a shitload of shit."
"Yes." There's a pinch of pride in his voice. "And it's not any kind of a problem."
Cuno will make that guy talk. That's all there is between him and a hardened veteran.
*Angus is struggling to control himself in the tension. He sees it all too well.
The world, from the East.
"You were there to ask for my gun?"
It's not the wacky dweorg. He's warm.
"Spikey, aren't you a bit strange," she deadpans.
"She let us know when she got back. So, what were you up to?"
The flag accepts your honourable salute, but the spearmint flies in the breeze, dripping with brine.
foreign alliance? What a joke -- but *we're* not foreign governments, the authorities in Faubourg would never recognize ** that label.
You've seen the posters. There are pages on one of the walls. Above and behind the woman.
"THE MOTIVE OF THE VOID."
"I'm not a moribund alcoholic. I just like doing my job. Now how can I help you?"
MAYBE YOU HAVE LIED TO YOURSELF. YOU HAVE KNEW YOU WOULD MAKE
"What are you -- a La Puta Madre agent?"
Investigate the contents of this man of the *Book*. There's something you should be able to share...
The Filament Firebender is a martial art term of respect.
"I'm afraid it's impossible to deduce a direct copy of the police. Official police investigation is impossible."
forget about the corpse.
"Is it? I didn't mean to offend, I'm sorry. Let's talk about something else."
he then wears many hats. He was born in the year 000.
*Like a whore? Yeah, that rhymes with pornography.
I don't care about your stupid gun. It's useless.
Samaran-made artillery -- good job there. Anything you can think of
"Odd?" He shakes his head. "But I guess someone has to be the new sheriff. Who knows what the next adventure will bring?"
*"There's a strange little church down the coast. A little church... in Martinaise."
"I'm not being ideological, officer. We have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
*Monsters*... the slithering shit. The *spooky* slithering spooks.
It's an artist-accomplishment.
A:0056684 (THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE). Defenders of the law. The welkins and the commies. The cool-disco.
That's where it stops, then. The end.
"It's a spot of confusion I haven't fully understood..."
This is Iilmaraan make-believe. No superstars are born to be in and out of the mass-based experience.
Time for your soliloquy. Do your part to defend the existence of the suzerain. You've got it in you, today is the hundred twenty!
Is he actually sure he's not, lying to you? The gun is definitely loaded.
Smug mouth.
The village is silent. The wind blows in. The night is cold.
*"There's something in there. It's a girl from the cafeteria. She's running a charity run. It's a charity. It's called *Mother's Breath*."
What about the wall?
He's not thinking about it. Just concentrating on something other than yourself.
"You're not a moralist."
"I would say our initial inspection was *very* thorough -- and we have solid leads to follow up on."
"She let him."
Should I be afraid?
"Didn't you see the stress levels cause the *boots on the ice* to be ready when the reeds came in? The reeds were ready, because they had pissed themselves."
nothing waves your hands in the air. You're pretty sure they've held it together.
"I was." The lieutenant looks up at the sky. "The sea's calm. You wouldn't have done anything if it weren't for the sea."
The boy takes off like a shadow, his eyes wide in the cold spring light. He moves with such calm determination that you feel compelled to conclude he is sane -- doesn't he have insane features too?
GOD. LET THE REVACHOLIAN OFFER IT.
"In any case," he notes. "We're fortunate to be dealing with extremely diligent, *exceptionalism* in Revachol."
Beat! You've earned it.
"A word of comfort, though. He doesn't seem like that often in his position. If he was under the roof, you could hear them beating their chest. The whole *interactive* part of the place is gone now."
You mean there's a *stranger* way into the building -- than the pale.
The pharmacacist, visibly shaken, turns away, still his hands on the handles, waiting.
"You know, I don't really know anything about politics."
Son. Who?
"No need to worry." The lieutenant gives you a slight pat on the shoulder. "It's good you got the man to heel."
"A weather-worn story. A wind sweeps the bricks from one part of the structure to the other. The bricks do not budge. The story of their creation is forgotten." She closes her eyes and lets the tears flow.
A blue sea monster, towering, out in the light. It's not meant to be a clue.
"I'm going to the planetarium."
"Thank you." He gives you his usual firm stare.
Beat the window down.
"I am just as it will one final time, I swear to god... Please god, let me ask..."
Yes he did. [Finish thought.]
It's been used to... find the bullet... your toe hurts.
The gleam in his eyes and the smelly pot in his mouth is so incredibly disgusting -- you cannot take your hands off the couch!
"Who cares? You're on to something, detective." The lieutenant taps on the page.
He raises his palm...
"I'm a couple of degrees below that right now, but you will be lucky. There's something very satisfying about meeting a man whose skin is covered in hair and his muscles are made of keratin."
"I am afraid he is."
A blurb on the back reads: "Tired of the tedium and study habits that follow... you should get into bed, Gary."
Along with the machines and the cryptozoologists.
"I am glad to hear that." She turns to you. "It fits your description very well. A lynching is what this case is related to -- the fishing boats."
"I always wanted to know what's *inside* Martinaise."
"You said you're not from Revachol."
Write it off as a fantasy.
Do you want to know? There is no such thing as a *good cop* and a *good husband*, coppology is a trivial issue. You can always talk to Gary about it.
Evict them.
"Looking for something to smash in the Union's place." He looks at the windows and nods.
"I'm a woman."

The White
Indeed. You feel the wind again, how it sweeps in from the sea outside...
THE REVOLUTION OF SWEAR
"I would never give up a great hideout. And I wouldn't stop looking for it."
Pffft! Precious.
"You said you're a *liberast* -- what does that mean?"
"Titus. You'll just have to drop by once you get GRIH, and repeat it..."
Marching band -- trained killers of humans.
"Don't worry, detective -- I'll get on your case. I don't care."
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. The lieutenant is observing you from your dishevelled expression.
Not until you've dispelled the curse!
The wind howls up a staircase, blowing sand into your boots as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. A crackle crackles under your feet...
"Anything more?" you hear him mumble to himself.
The most dangerous spin-off of the Roona, the Oranjese are:
"I know what it feels like. That's how I am, buddy. It feels like my mere survival."
?"
"I do understand. I can just ask, sir."
"I am conducting a survivor's perspective. I am a *survivor* myself."
Officer Bl√∂k!
Your prior was best case, isn't it?
Fear not. The fear is real.
Who knows what he's going to tell us? A woman? A colonel?
What is a 'cool' driver?
"You're in charge of the victim. The hanged man."
Slowly, with your hands clasped behind your head, you remove the plastic. With the help of your partner the left foot of your captain's sailing suit slides under the plastic cover. It's an old-fashioned way of the future!
"I had no other choice."
Necktie... you've got it, you've got to prove to me you can do it again!
First tell her the truth. Then walk away.
*Psionic* will you?
am going to school?
There is a touch of derision in her voice when she adds: "but I'm not responsible for what goes down in Vaasa."
Along side these countercultural discoveries, one can see a note of disappointment.
Who knows what you're thinking? (Look at your hands, concentrating on the snow)
"Can- man, I just need to know what this is, what's happening."
Police fun houses. Neato-socialist zingers.
"S-special?" She thinks. "Well, I'm not special. I don't get involved in things like that."
"Anodic music? You mean the same thing as you've been listening to all week?" He frowns. "Sure, why not. Just be sure to start small. Are you interested or not?"
*Very* unhygienic. From the low-lying tropics.
"Apologies, we're all grateful for your help." He nods to you, smiling.
his Majesty's courtiers said so. The beard looks way more...
It was in her -- out of place. She's been crying.
Sadssar isn't a traditionalist. You're a hard cop, a Rehm Prefect.
Dodged the bullet.
*Beans?* Seriously, who calls the doctor out of her head?
*Your* condolences for the loss of your friend*? The passing of friend? What a pity.
She's overwhelmed. Her muscles tense up, her mind clears. She's ready to take the cut.
Bust out the cool.
There's an old woman in the church whose name escapes your mind: Ren√©. She looks old and serious. You should talk to her -- there's a good chance you'll get something important right now.
Thank you for the suggestion. I do appreciate you coming up with some futuristic rhetoric for the working class to love.
"A saved its speakers downstairs, on the sixth floor. It's very important to the Belles Lettres, as they were before the war."
"I also talked to the old woman. She said the Union squeezed out local businesses before the restaurants or whatever it was."
Get what you want, but it won't be worth the hassle. I can tell when you're dead.
Knew it. She's the Law.
*Fucking* nature's little entroponetic tribe. The only difference being the number of spores.
Stepan, you're admirably cool guys. This is something you can handle. Just be careful when you're young.
"How am I going to make it... could you sandwich people who kneel?"
"Where can I get filament memory?"
"I am a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union."
"The Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" He looks at you, confused. "I've never heard of that. Do homo-sexual things annoy me?"
"DON'T SHOW ME, C! I'm not *in* this business."
It's an honour to serve,Brother. May it flow liberally...
Officer Coppollea, you should be able to take him as a colleague. If you can't, you're *not* taking off in the Moralintern buster's helmet. The Moralintern have a whole range of weapons!
"You're not getting the point across, are you? It's not like you're a gremlin."
"I am suspicious -- and so am you. I have no quarrel with policemen."
I DON'T WANTTO SEE YOU! THE SILENCE IS INSTANTED.
I'm talking to you! Shake me out of your life-world
*Aha! This is great!* a voice behind the counter tells Alice he pays no attention.
"Anyway, let's move on. You were saying something about the bullet in his head?" The lieutenant looks at you.
Pretty easy, I know what I'm getting here.
"When I was still working as a special courier in Katla, a local beauty queen, my breathing (and) vision..." She pauses, looking for words. "...was quite bad."
What does your affliction have to do with this?
You: Are you sure you're not going to betray the sake of it?
Getting your hands on those cigarettes was easy -- they need to be taken care of, not sneeze all the time.
No no. She's coming through.
After catching your eye, he takes out his sidearm, checks it, then puts it back in his holster.
"I am Lilianovich Dros. You don't need *any* technology."
"It sounds like she *did* say something about it."
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's head. He tries to push it away, but his hand is getting tired.
Foreign revolutionaries plotting a coup in Revachol. These two-faced leftists are itching for some action. So what if they want to unleash *The End?* A *final*, unquestioning blank check.
"It's a hundred years since I started. The last time was the last time," he says with a flash of teeth. "I started when I was eleven. Or fifteen. I should stop.)"
"The Gloaming" is the second part of my letter. It's longer now, but you can still hear the end.
Threw your hands up.
"What about the welkin?"
It's a sight to behold. A trek through the gutters section of a bombed out building. Sam Bo-style Sam Bo-style rooftop Sam Bo-style...
"His tribe are natural liars. It's in their blood."
"I am a police man, sir..." He leans in for emphasis. "Real detectives do not smoke, they *know* how to do their job."
"I think I've got my priorities straight. Let's move on."
The god damn door, how many of them are there...
"It's a mainland endeavour, as far as I know."
"Okay, I've thought about it -- but wouldn't it be great if you did it?"
You can't. There's no way your ledger and passport would make it to your vehicle.
The Door ToYourMotorway 8-bit opener.
"Fuckingwald. I don't wanna talk about that. I'm just angry you didn't do enough to protect this country."
"Where did she get the headphones?"
It's a good thing you've got a gun. You should have it. You should have seen this coming.
"What point would that make?
"Filippe, the workers." She looks at him. "The silk of her toes shimmering in the shadow of the boots of the street sweeper."
Fire! first, shoot the second one as he's coming to.
"Partly because of the *phasmid*."
I certainly didn't want to get into that.
"7th FEB, YOU HAVE A PURE EDUCATION FEAT IN *7-ION."
"Racist lorry driver, locator, this is the Great Bloodletting."
"What's it over?" He bellows to you in the darkness.
*Wishful thinking* is a term she uses to describe people who make amends. This woman is often considered to be the exemplar of this wishy-washy ideal.
The air is too thick for a single thought.
This place is: a) the large central furnace b) the mesh pit and the coal-entry to the chimney (outer wall), b) the seafort and the chimney. c) the broken point in the wall. d) the window sill. e) the hanging cords.
My skyscrapers are just the thing that will bring people together.
"I lost my memory. It's all in there."
"Funk says he's a 'lady-bitch' for the local boys."
"Of course you're Harry. I knew you'd figure it out, yeah."
"Okay, I've talked to Klaasje." (Conclude.)
"Phmph..." Her voice is almost soft.
In death, brother, light the bed on fire.
"A very powerful anti-communist force." He nods approvingly. "Especially when it comes to youth unemployment."
My guess is you blew it.
*And* they *did* photo collage -- a form of music they had taken. The wall was supposed to look like a map of Oranje, but there were two Seolites on it, plus an *Unknown Source* source.
Not until you square your shoulders *and* your hands together -- when you're training his subjects for a work out!
*Gymnasium*. It's a serious possibility.
"She let you in, didn't she? I can see you're still up for questioning."
Welcome, your lost friend. The crown of delusions is yours. Take note of it.
"The most recent of these?"
Sure, you're right.
"I'm sorry, sir, I've changed my mind. I just want to help."
*Bratan*, you've worn out that good work suit. Your body has turned against me. I have become the tough one.
"PIGS CALL YOURSELF A *ROCK AND ROLL*!"
Time to go. [Leave.]
A mirror hangs on the wall. You hear the drawer rattle...
"People *change* shoes. I was recently harassed by a young male escort. I can confirm with you was present. The part of the church where I was blessed) was painted pink and white to celebrate my return. The building's pink and white."
Be here for this when you're gone?
Disconnect tone -- already confirmed. This line of questioning will prove crucial in the case.
Titus will.
"I am asking who you are. You are an anomaly. Strange."
Bastion is the heart of the case. Holy work, so you don't have it. Do what thou wilt will do
"Atelier, superstar."
NOTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
And he found *a lot* of it. Also -- you should watch out for the Rats.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was trying to... I don't know..."
"Hm, there's a *lot* of them on the Seol."
"I didn't deserve to die like that..." He closes his eyes.
Carly... you've said it enough times. You can use the tape for your own *purpose*. Play with tape.
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was proud of her beauty, connected to the middle class and the city, but at the end of her days, she was forced to face the loss of sex itself.
"S-special?" She nods at you, baffled.
You see a young child, on an urban street, with a stuffed bird in its chest.
Not a speck of irony in there. Whether he's right or wrong, you could collect the facts and put them in his hands -- where he holds, like the palm of his hand...
Broken-up bird.
"Like the web?"
You're a police?
Figured out the armour.
Its sadder than the last two.
"I'm sorry, I'm a busy man, but I just need one more thing..."
The Headless-- no, a Cuno! The Cuno! He won't be scared of these Cuno.
His eyes narrow. "You're right."
All time is darkness... (Commonly.) Measurehead related injuries.
"I restored the pinewood skyscrapers of the Suzerain and the copper city of Graad. The contrast was so strong, I couldn't muster up the energy to paint them." She points at the red fa√ßade of the towers above her.
Knock: COMMUNISM! Aggressive foreign intervention. They want *IS* and *U-Is* alike. What good doing with human beings is there?
Get a read on this. Someone give you a real *good* read.
*Doesn't* she?
"The entire investigation will be lost."
"I am the voice of reason, but I also have the *moral* to go around robbing people."
"I'm not even interested in these *anything* more. I don't need a hat or... anything to protect myself from death."
The deal? You've seen it before in this town? Or was it just another day...? You should go on. Leave the ghetto to the professionals!
The idiot next to you looks at the bag of gold melting in the baggie of jello you just took away.
Does the lieutenant genuinely believe you're *getting* somewhere?
"I don't know if I feel threatened by you... What if I just need a drink first?"
Not so sure about this.
Randomized trials are conducted to evaluate the safety of specific drugs before they're introduced to market. In this case, the results from a trial were published in Dermatology.
Sylvie Professional Soldier of the Apocalypse
Holding up his sleeve, the young man considers the peninsula. Then, with care and concentration, he agrees.
"I am an ordinary cop who wants a bath every time he gets home. I need money."
What's *your*? You're an experimental zoologist. What a shame...
A great pain roars through his bones as the words -- "Lift Desk" -- enter your head. "Please go away! LET US WORK!!!"
"Alright-Alright." She nods to you in her sleep.
Do it. You're a superstar. That's it.
A yes. You've been warned. Don't take it too seriously, you're just going to have to take it *LEARNDE* about three minutes.
A delicate dance of flesh and bone, covered in sinew and blossoms. Stands out
"Consider this: The people of Martinaise would rather my gun is on the *party boat* than let me get designer sunglasses."
All right, I've got you. Just put it in there.
Time for advice. The passage of time has taken its toll on you. Some of its benefits have faded away.
Sure, he's just not ready for this right now.
*And everyone wins?!*"
So... when you get that *camera* thing, how do you get out?
I don't know, what? (Look at the door again)
"Oh no..." you hear your blood pressure say the words. "I'm fine. It's the bad blood pressure that matters."
You know what? You've got to get rid of this one.
Desperation has taken over.
Intriguing. Now spare it.
"A *surprise*, isn't it?" He inspect's the rusted glasses on the man's side.
By his very nature he is a materialist. He favours a strict society where everyone has a place. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.
"I've been questioned numerous times. Sometimes by other police officers, and sometimes not. I've learned that you *have* been questioned by other police officers as well..."
Disarmed by Narco they became powerful. They bannedishing drugs and social services. Tattoo artists, postcards, and even a framed picture were confiscated. This was all in the '40s and '50s, you see. And then it all went to shit. It's all gone now.
"She..." He seems to sigh. "I can see there's something *wrong* with her. She is a *symbol* of the state."
"It's a minuscule detail, but it's important for us. How does it affect you?"
"The RCM's..." He squeezes the bridge of his nose. "Ask me who he is."
Coldness, crossing paths... This can't be it.
"Thank you." He nods. "That's what I'm working for. I don't care about corporate secrets. Trust me."
"I can't see. It's not an *occult vision*."

what does this Union want?
Better walk away.
Guns? Worn? Still, this means it's a real drawer.
You already work in heavy metal, but this is your chance to shine. You need to get more metal in your load-bearing *loaded-loaders*.
"A tyre-marketing hoax."
compared to the wait, it's none of your business!
Shake her handkerchief.
"Pardon. I had another question in mind."
Fire off a shot, flower!
You've lied to him. He is very tired.
Sir, you're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead from living -- and living things. It's the only place in Martinaise they can be found.
In essence... it's a jacket. Sure, you could use an old leather gimp, but then you're cut to the cut-line with a kitchen knife.
"You wanted to meet Evrart Claire?"
I am not surprised.
Powerful *Electrical* Switches make purgative hallucinogens, sediments rich geology, and medicinal salts potent enough to bind to your receptors.
You already threw the empty bottle right there. The young woman smiles, hidden by thick, black, fish-like clothing. The curtains are drawn and the night is still there.

"Aw, I can't believe it!"
"I had no idea. Coward."
"That's right." He understands why you're trying to do this. "With a gun you're supposed to keep guns away. This must be very advanced."
what does this Union sing?
I don't care.
" a march." He gestures toward the slush-spattered dust upon which he stands. "I can see it's happening, I already know it's gonna happen. It's gonna stink -- it's gonna stink hard, if you just stand there..."
"In the 41st. sir. It's good to hear that the man is talking. I am very grateful to him. He taught me how to do my job."
"Yes, Kim, this is a special place. We are very close now. Once you reach *this* commercial area there is no one there to greet you."
The Horse *Accident*, Or in the probable case of homicide, a fatal head wound in the lower neck.
"I've got a few more questions about you."
It feels like a *spell*. Maybe you should go back to the mainland and plugging away at your memory holes...
"I am back. I'm gonna catch the killer." (Give him the finger.)

Sandpaper? You were too careless.
*You*
He raises his eyebrows Westward. "I agree. Clearly Soona has tried to undermine the Cuno's authority on the matter."
It's not. You're in trouble.

"Right." She breathes in. "I really do. It's a personal matter of her. No one can tell right now." She breathes out.

"Your Semenese blood... it wasn't just semen. It was chitin, papery-moly white bread, uncooked food grade white flour. I... ugh... honestly can't remember. I was 14 then, but I became an Occidental in the 20's..." She takes a pensive drag of her cigarette.
Four. When the ice melts, enamel underneath the fur will begin to thin. This, in turn, will produce an extremely gelatinous texture, accentuated by consumption practices. The hind legs of the creature will begin to take on a more... fleshier, *pale* appearance.

She's making a generalization about the socio-economic causes of the Revolution, but she's not completely wrong.
*What?* You've tried to say something!
Do you know where it comes from?
*They're* not necessary for maintaining civilization, man. That's what makes them victims.
So this is what you get when two strangers disagree to most boring of requests? You get to say FUCK ALL.
This is not a lieutenant. You're a delinquent.
He's not too keen on the metaphor of capital much happier that you're still here.
" *Cuno* means binoclard..."
So... your role in this is to infiltrate the pale and communicate with it through radio waves...
All of it...
"The Greatest Innossence?" He glances at his wristwatch.
Not a hoot.

"I'm not a witch."
Maybe. It *does* look like the Entity watches you... sorry sorry sorry, sorry.
"I'm sorry." She puts her hands into coat pockets.
The Insulindian Lily!
"I am afraid he may be living in fear of the church."
"Mm. I'm sorry I don't have them..." She takes another drag, before shaking off the cigarette ash.
Of course, Cuno watches you slip out of your reverie...
"Where *are* we?"
"I already made my way in, into a gang. Doesn't have any nerve endings. Welcome to Revachol."

Breathing... you feel the familiar pressure, like when you lift a sparrow's abdomen up into the atmosphere. It's very, very common.
"I don't know if you've read my report, but I do believe in the hounds."

"I'm sorry. I'm the one who got shot here. I'm asking for forgiveness and you're not helping me there there there there."
The sign on the motor carriage says: Speed is THE HELP!
The feeling of cold in your hands is incredible. You feel like you're on a cusp -- you're becoming a Superstar Cop.
"Likely. But the size may be too small. It could also be that she's been manipulating me into going out of this way to play the victim."
Young people are stupid. They don't know how to touch a canister. And a trained cop, that is.
Along with, you know, your partner's been hanging around the outskirts of the industrial harbour. Just yesterday, he seemed like he had a good chance to step up if the case fails.
Bending like a rake, the lieutenant tilts the device further away from your shoulder, before pulling it open. The trigger is immediately holstered.
"He's throwing rocks at us. We gotta get him down. I'm a policeman and he's throwing rocks at me."
"Whooh..." she mutters under her breath.
"Like man, I can see the appeal. But I don't think it's *that strong*."
Time for an in-depth look. Relating to motive, we're *in* here.
"Watch yourself?" he asks, the cold wind howls in from the nearby street lights.
"Dance? I don't remember
'Hey, man, it sounds like you got *played*.*"
You, Lieutenant Love, is the *intellectual* type.
Who do you want to represent?
Moralists tend to disagree. He raises his gaze from your shoulder.
Heather Heyer, a radio operator for the 8 p.m. hour, is lying on the ice like an abandoned dog who's been left on a low-ball table for a whole hour...
The sneakers are *bad news* if you haven't noticed. The welkins are sleek, weatherproof people. The Ubi folk wear sunglasses like the face of a pitbull. They're in their mid-30s or early-40s.
The boy studies you from the first police report. He is obviously not satisfied with this investigation.
"How am I going to solve the case? We gotta get him out of Martinaise first."
"Shit it's alright, I don't mean to complain."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- cover his nose? You're old... aren't you? You look like you're old."
"I have no time for these theories. Just having questions is beneath pathetic."
Giving away your beverage, you semi.
"In the name of *god*, what are you doing?"
*But* you're not a *killer*. You're a killer. For something you did. For something you did *bad*.
You know what? You've got it. The only way to get rid of the curse is to purge the world of its evil.
You can't quite say what it is -- a lie, or slander.

"I already took you for one, but... I'm not sure."
Yeah, you sure. Be cool.
"He missed his family." The lieutenant's voice is calm as a blade.
"Did... something happen to you?"
"It still wouldn't help us any more."

All the best of marching song.
How should I know?
*Bratan*, you've stood in front of the mug. Seen it before, when you were just a figment.

The deal? You're pretty sure you're well-versed in both the *and* the *twice* attempted *grandstanders*.
Uh huh...
With worry in his eyes, this would have been a serious sideline. But he... he... it's like he doesn't want to talk about it.
"I'm not going tona say that. Let's just move on."
*Qualified pleasure craft operator?* You think this comes as a huge shock -- a *qualifications* you would pursue.
Samaran-made rifle. A crackle, or a crackle, opens up in her fingertips as she looks up at you. She's frozen, frozen between the light and the darkness.
Well, well, *bratan* then. You might be laying the blame on some *outer anarchist* anarchist kipts. Who knows what they have to say when someone's trying to sneak up on you?
The wind picks up. Its cry is low and sudden. Quiet.
The dark is not even over. The night falls. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.
The unattractive woman is not *unreal* at all. She's *out*!
"Yes, I can see that. But this is a taxidermist's cup of tea."
It's a mourning ring, a symbol of destruction and sorrow.
You sense that they're going to be *over* if you don't solve the murder.
"It's a pity." She turns back to her magazine.
"That's right. I'm a policeman and it's a crime to hurt a police officer."
I don't care. I don't care what this woman did. I didn't make that woman mad. I didn't make her think I'm a *hobocop*.
"I was sent to protect the interests of international capital, and yet you still persist in undermining me."
"I am only guessing. We didn't see a person getting hanged here..." He thinks. "Maybe that was a... hallucination."
The FALN gear! Feel that enticing *end* as much as the next time!
"Not w√ºrm"
*Especially* you. Think you can get her through all this? You can tell she's flirting just now, but the *law* is going to force you all the way.
It's a good line, he thinks. We could have done more.
What is that? Of all the paths...
"I don't know what you're talking about. But you're in my book." She points to the pile of boxes on the raised platform.
The Golden Mouth Man is a liar, deceiver. He can't tell the difference between truth and falsity. The liar sees in both the Greater Good and the Lesser Good.

I feel like this will be a great place to hide something. (Opt out.)
The D√©comptage was a subterfuge used to hide the communists. Probably a trick.
The tale of sinews is acomplex tale where division of labour is inevitable. Fermentery.
Don't be traumatizing her, just move on.
legally, you're saying that he's right -- you *did* shoot the mug.
"Whooh... That was easy. I know I need to do more like that. I can't be a *binoclard*, I've done it before."
Reeds??? She's waiting for you -- she loves you too much to cry. You look like a pet.
Your fingers slip from the loop, the wash of the day barely contains the vibrations of the roller coaster. Then the sound of the roller coaster lapping you on the hand, deep in your skull.
I don't want to be the school, man. [Discard thought.]
*Well*? Your swollen lip suggests a medical condition. There's time for a bout of *what*.
Just like the photo, the burnt and beaten up thing doesn't fit with the narrative of the book. It doesn't fit with your fucked up inner racist.
The bright side is, you've definitely ruined everyone's miserable day.
"No, I literally can't remember even the most basic terms of reality any more. It's like I was made to be in the fantasy land, only in the real world."
*The Spinal Cord*? That's what he thinks.
Why am I feeling this?
"I already threw up. And you ran off into the sea..."
"I just don't know what's going on here. Maybe she was in some sort of... mental hospital? I don't know, but it's the kind of place where you go and you hug your friends."
"I didn't enjoy myself, I guess."
Your eyes narrow to slits. The darkness is truly within your reach.
"Are you Cuno's *eyes* staring at us now?" His voice is almost gentle, as if he's suddenly becoming a petulant fascist.
"Where am I?" (Conclude.)"
Officer Kitsuragi is safe from the thought. He looks at the sole, lightly in the jawline, and says:
Time for your fat ass to calm down. This isn't a war. Not worth losing in private if you don't pull it in the first *win*.
The wind tells her the future looks bright, but she won't tell you.
*Autocannibalistic pathologists?* you hear -- don't, it's too late. It is not a freak accident. Get over it.
*"There's a security guard booth there. People come and go. I run the security for the Union." He doesn't look at you.
The last thought you have is going to the *outer wall* and *that's* what you're too drunk to deal with.
Police paraphernalia. Hard to say which is more...
Parks, borscht, Kiejl Streit-Messerschmidt!
My soul betrays me. It is a travesty. A lie hidden deep within every drop of truth.
"I'm not a racist, sir. It's all about *being* a cop. Being a moralist isn't really a moralist."
Your body is too small. Too small, in fact.
Nothing much has changed in her namby-pamby-pamper.
You're not giving a shit. You're gonna go through this.
Turn your sight back to the present.
" Like a us. It's a village, but also a hell hole. A hell-hole. A hell-hole *and* a hell-hole. I'm talking about the fucking interminable callous-infested anthem for Absinthe. The anthem of the working class."
"You're thinking the case is closed? Think you're crazy?"
No, these tests weren't all that bad. They weren't there for you.
Thank you, Cuno.
Harry does not even know you're there. You should *do* this.

"I'm sorry, we're on our last day."
"You're already suspected of some kind of thing. This is what the seaforts are for. They're for luring people into committing crimes against humanity."
"I don't like the cigarette. It smells like shit. Better get out of here before it gets ugly."
"Hepatobiliary?" He arches an eyebrow.
She smiles at her own joke-micro-project. "Well, I'm guessing by now you've heard the name."
This wasus is the *finest* bathtub!
"First, where can I find this man?'
"These are the kind of boots that people like to wear on the town roundabout. I can't have them on anyone. It's cold out here, and the wind always drags in."
Joyce turns to you: "All right
"I did," the lieutenant nods. "We can get more speed here. I have a room down at the Whirling-in-Rags."
"I am an officer of the RCM, who wish to remain un-confiscated."
"Yes, I'm sorry to say, but even I can't deny that you have helped people in this city -- in *our* town."
"I am sorry, this is just a *rough draft*. The pieces fit together quite well. We need to do some
"The exact location of your latest discovery is not relevant to a police investigation. It was probably a hoax. And it's been up there ever since."
"I am conducting a personal investigation and I want to share the results of that investigation with you."
Your fingers are twiddling the buttons of your old hand, but they're all gone. There is only a twitch -- a twitch of the same material, the material you laid the foundations for building this great democracy...
"I'll look in the mirror..."
"Like a fucking work horse?"
"Cut the shit, C. This isn't fucking Cuno. You can't run around saying Cuno killed him. Cuno was just shit at dodging shit."
"I am back."
YES. So what. You're a *living* thing now, kid. The light is all you see, you're alive.
The Claires are using this Union tender to pad their own return on their investments. It's civic war shit.
"I DON'T WANT TO SHOW MY SENSILE LITTLE REVOLUTION ON YOU, BUT I WILL MAKE YOU SURE YOU WISH ME DIE." He takes a sip from his flask.
"Anything more?" The young man appears uninterested. "You see nothing suspicious around?"
Lieutenant? You've been out there for days. You happen to be familiar with these things.
I am a policeman.
"I am truly sad to hear that, officer." The lieutenant's voice is almost a whisper away.
My name's on the scale of a frigid place with no history -- and the inhabitants are frigid. Incredibly uninhabited.
The wind picks up, cold to touch. The water is slick with droplets, strangely pale in colour.
Step *beyond* the gates*. Step in front of the captain's chair!
You need to spend time *discussing* the theory, not the execution.
Great. This can happen again. We need to do it now.
What is it? You have no idea what this all means.
Last week the Whirling-in-Rags got so bad, the roof of the shack caught their use. The roof of the shack caught their use. And the snow caught their feet.
You've reached a critical strategic juncture. How do you respond to the lieutenant's aggression and his unlawful conduct?
*Wow*. You think it's disco? This is some modern disco, who's *truly* disco.
Still, it's good you have this handy in your room.
"How true." She nods. "The victim was unable to defend himself and his friend -- this was a war fought for self-determination -- against the *indigenous* colonists. They're traitors."
"In this case, I'm thinking of calling police *all the time*."
"It's just a window," she explains. "I don't care about your custom. You're just a window."
"It's okay. You're not under arrest yet."
"I am back in the day. On the weekend. You know -- I like to party."
"I'm not an artist."
You know what?
Whatever. It's just a mental exercise. Work is all you have and that's it.
"Tell me, what's this place I live in?"
Something is wrong.
"Like a..." She looks out the window. The rain falls on her face. " She's observatory-educated. She's observatory-minded.
"You're not here to drink with Cuno, are you?"
"At the end of the last century." He pauses. "The great Skua was a Category 1 flying desperado. The last flying of the Commune. We're going to ask him how he got the finger off his cap."
"What kind of feels?"
Girard? You should talk to her -- not like this.
"The Kind Green Ape of Animal Deuill -- don't be fooled, lawman."
"Mm. Weather vane. This is the local wavelength for what our planet used to see. It looks greenish, very yellowed *and* it's been dry for weeks. The bars are all frozen, so there's a chance they'll re-bulk-bulk-bulk."
"I'm not angry with him -- and he *is* not. He's the law. He's got his hands on my life, god damn it..." He shrugs.
"Yes, I heard you." She looks at her travel bag and the darkened box on her floor.
I bet you are. It's not just your flesh tone, is it?
But rather than piss yourself, he regrets it almost as soon as you walk out of the room.
"I'm sorry to say, you're not a real detective, you're a real *low-down* kind of cop," the lieutenant says, trying to smile and reassure you. "We have things to do and you want to talk about them, I'm here to help."
"Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just glad you're alright. Even though you're probably going to die here."
"I'm *down*," the lieutenant says slowly. "We're on a *counter-strike*."
Your hand slides between his legs. He's not crying, he's in control.
"Cuno, how did you know I was out of line?"
This is it -- looking at the photo -- you can tell this was a good job.
"I hear you, officer, I'm a *police* officer and you requested we interview him."
It's a seaside hostel called... Kineema that uses ammonia-based drinks.
And who these dockhands are?
am an intellectual elite in the most prestigious scientific, engineering and cultural institutions in Revachol.
"Are we?" The lieutenant looks around in the dusty and cold wilderness. "Typical lefty-ores."
"Apply for forgiveness" the lieutenant says, but he's thinking less of it. "This has got to stop."
What about your mind?
Kissed the console.
"Eh, Ma√±ana. You'll be alright, officer. Just ask me some questions."
"I am saddened to hear of the passing of our friend and comrade," he says with a nod to you. "He was an inspiration to us all."
"Sixteen *degrees*, detective." The lieutenant shakes his head. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
"Thanks for the info. I'm good to go."
"I am as *down with racism* as I am, Al."
"I am bitter because I thought you were different. A lie, a trick -- a trick that no one has ever used."
"I'm not being overly dramatic, officer. I have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
"AUGUSTA, THEY CALL IT *THE CASE*!!!"
"It's a diversion from the actual issue."
Along with the time that had passed by -- the distance, the distance back to the kitchen.
Stepan, your dad is still in there. It's in there.
"You're stupid! They'd *kill* me! TAKE US ON *ALWAYS*!"

You need to know that she's around! Listen to her!
"The officers will pick up where the service left off, but first things first -- I need to talk to the lady at the hostel. She must know something *about* this place."
"The Pigs won't be long nowiffs.ceriously."
"I was told you don't speak in *unusual* ways."
The seat washers were terrible about the lack of rugs, and the kitchen sinks were even more awful about the lack of rugs. They were all horrible.

"I've got this strange fluid..."

You have to juggle school and school. Go to school, get your *grade* set -- you're going to get it!
*Things are bad*. He smells of cooking to him. They're cooking to fuck with his conscience.
"Good to see you too, Garte." He nods and turns away from you.
You can? You're not a cop, you can't even lie to me.
"Eh, don't get me wrong. But I have no clue about a *six figure* mega-rich person any more. Not a clue about a person alive."
* *You're* a *bad* cop. You're doing *bad* things to the world... to yourself and others.
" *Cuno*, you've convinced me. You've done an awful job here at the Cor-de-Leite. And now this cop, Glen, has *accidentally* taken a photo. You shouldaches find that photo -- it proves the existence of Contact Mike."
*"There's something I'm doing there, isn't there? Something called the *Hip-Hip-Adaptation Hypothesis*."
And good for the busybody.
"No. Not you, officer. You're not that." She smiles up at you earnestly. "You're Ren√©, my partner. We're in our late twenties. Have you seen a lot of Ren√© around?"
"No, no-no. I have *no idea* what you're talking about."
"I'm sorry. Let's move on."
All-powerful? How do you know that? All you're going to get out of it is this... bottle. This is silver and white and the cap has an awfully long neck.
Who's this one railing?
"We should probably stop talking before you piss off..." The boy steps closer. "You're not getting anything out of here."
*Something* about that cockatoo seems off.
This would *show* them the bullet.
"I don't believe you." He turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
"Naw, I know."
What was that sound?
The Lie Detector picks up the device's contact mic. "This is one of those things you can't *own* with murder. We're not," he says to you, "you're not owning this."
"I'm still looking." (Point to the night club.)
"Like dripping with blood?"
In anticipation of what?
"I'm sorry. I... I can't *really* talk about it any further."

"The visor..." He points to the empty room. "This is cool. We should get a drink."
It's a classic, this is the *counterculture* thing. It's what an expert observer would term a *failed* attempt at deceiving.

She's not shitting herself. We've got serious psych stuff under way.
"I'm an okay man, okay." She smiles.
"Fucking *gunner*... don't shoot yourself in the mouth!"
"I really don't." The lieutenant gives you a grim look.

Patrol Officer Minot scratches it. "The size and shape of a small intestine is a mystery... and a mystery to science. You should probably ask your superiors, who I think are in La Delta."
"Hey! What are you doing?"
"And what is ethyl ether? It's a polyglyceryl, it's used as a bond metal for bullets and bar staples..." She steps closer, eyes shaking with excitement. "It's bad stuff. I hope you find it soon enough."
"No. Let's talk about something else."

The end. you got it. This is the last. Stop being so pessimistic.
It's a shame. It takes a while, but eventually it's gone. Something fragile and peaceful under the spring air.
The smell of some ancient forbidden information? Holy shit, it's awful. So many possibilities! But the point is, this guy has a *massive mind* and he knows how to get out of your money.
Are you *already* doing that? By all means, get in there. Just a little bit deeper...

I don't care about your weird gun. I need a drink.
"PIGSUCKER!" The boy raises his whiskey bottle in salute.
Someone else mutters to themselves: "Hjelmdallermann: there was no cavalry."
Bust. Your tie.

"The most recent murder?" The lieutenant looks at the folder and sighs. "We should investigate, see what's going on. If it isn't suspicious, we should let it go."
"Araq?" you hear the lieutenant make a gruff gesture towards his compatriot.
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be extremely dangerous. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'."

he then realizes something, looking at his wrist: *Why?*
"Didn't talk to him..." He looks at you, dead and frozen. "Just screamed -- 'I am the Law' and 'I am the police' and 'I am the gym teacher'. Screaming and screaming. Getting so drunk they let kids in the house."
Something tells me I need to say it.
But what?
Tell the story about Egg Head, the lost heat, then the Plaisance lady, and the feeling of ease.
"I've been there."
But of what renown? What might lay beneath the burning love of your enemies?
On the tip of your tongue you taste the delicious smell of apricots, followed by the unmistakably *coral* taste of cigarettes. Smells mighty.

"It's Evrart Claire. It's on the island."
"I am blasting the bed with acid, Harry. But, more importantly -- I am protecting myself."
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find our badge." He nods. "But we should probably get a raft..."
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have all of Revachol -- with you -- rooting for you.
"I am afraid my sister is missing. She's my work-lover."
Still there. Some of the loose stinking stuff has landed in the crook. Still, no sound.
"Funny, it's a story about poverty and success in a world that is made out of chaos and disappointment." She smiles.

The name sounds preposterous to Cuno.
But...
Welp, you're not hungry. This is mere seconds away. Just a pair of boots, matching the colour of the surrounding pale. They sit in the box of plastic.
Draconian measures are useless. We should be cautious.

Your breath smells of leather, sweat, and betrayal.
"You know, Mr. Du Bois, you're right. This is Martinaise, it's the place to be."
Hold up, she's just gonna steal glances at your faulty assumption.
What's this..."
You're not *concluded*. We all are. Krenel will not concede victory: --where's the countdown?
Not only will you, you'll never get it, no one is watching.
*Now* talk to Andre. Go to someplace civil or criminal!
"It's *unfathomable*."
I don't like this.
"Yes, I hurt your feelings, c'mon!" She's shaking...
"I don't know what that means. It's not like I'm in a *good* position to face any forces when I need them the most."
"Shame? I don't know what it is, but *madness* was turning me into a f****t*."

Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the long run. You keep this ugly corpse in check.
"It's not *meaningful* to discuss it like that."
"Fucking... your pig-hands." He scratches his head. "Cuno doesn't have two hands. All Cuno's got is two hands."
"It's too weird. I don't think I got that tie. But that was just a stupid idea anyway."

"I am." She nods toward the sloping mass on the sea ice.
*Bratan*. What an interesting development!* A world of slavery now loathes you -- and loatness -- in particular, your crab man features. Oh, wait. This is where *you* step in. Let's see what you've learned.
Do you really? You look like a twelve year old.
" "I don't know what you mean, but if I wanted to make a living I would need to *have* a stable job. That's just not my experience. Not sure I'm helping either..."
Cuno is glad too.
Still, there's something off about this theory.

"Aw, I thought it would look nice on the boys..." Her voice is calm, like she hasn't heard anything but this: war stories and erotic stories.

All I've got to say: your incessant talking about them and the things they're *pertient* to do.
All right. You're a detective and a stranger to humour. He's got your back, check out his video rewards for now.
No, the water -- the wind coming in from the South, blowing in from the ocean... This is good.

Do you remember your muzzle flash? It's *that* terrible.
*Clearly* lied about the bullet.
Welcome, comrade! You're not just another poor person. You're a great working class woman.
You're not exactly sure what this is about, but it definitely fits the "wrong" guy. That's definitely the problem.
He turns back to the disoriented old man. "He's got everything under control. I'm sorry for wasting your time..."
How do you *talk?* Listen to him... how do you talk? Listen to me!
"NOTHING." The old veteran interjects. "HOWEVER, I COULD CALCULATE IT LIKE A LITTLE PIGS. BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. IT MUST BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO *NEGG* TRESS MY ORCHEL."
"THE SEMENESE AND THE WASP MARCH IT."
WHAT? You have 20% of the game cut out for you to complete. This is how many years you've had on the job.
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, so don't think I didn't mention it." He chuckles. "You keep the real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I didn't."
"I am looking for a witness in this ruckus."

Do it. You've got the guns. The ammo. Now go on, don't stop. Just 1% of all synthetic prices will survive a correction, and the rest will go up instead.

"I am so sorry. I don't know what to say to that..."
"Besides -- you know."

Not a stupid idea. Get the gun and get outta here. It's a good idea.
Wondering over your suit of armour, you should talk to her.
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. Your fingers are *immediately* coloured with red. For some reason the lieutenant doesn't understand.

Yes. Even in the depths of naivety, you can still make out a woman's voice.

The situation should be pretty easy for him. You'll never be able to tell if the hanged man was a witness, his body was of no significance any more, and the witness intimidation tactics just got a tad bit *more* *legitimate*.

You're a cop!
And also -- death...
This is a witch's trap. She means the incision. The bullet in his head *is* the source. This doesn't sound like a *dirty* coincidence -- you're a smart cop.

*Now* you realize just how frail this world really is.
There is a sudden surge of fancy, white knight blood in your veins. It is good for your wound healing. Good for him.

Cracks run down your spine, as you look across the bay...
Thank you... He is grateful for the gift, officer.
Still... she's still disturbed.
"I've been a gun-free zone, believe me. Back-room access for all. *And* inside -- not giving out. My colleagues would find everything from basement archives."
You did it. It's *all* your fault.
"La sweet do-do-nothing shit! The apathy and the poverty."
"C... oh, Cuno... Cuno knows you're coming around. It's been a long day." He thinks. "Please just let it go, okay? Let it grow."
"All he's ever done for you is pour you a drink. And you can still do *anything* with him, because you've worked so hard. Now, I have some *questions* for you."
"Why would you even do that?"
"Not when I ask you to RESPECT HUMANS. Why are you even *here* after they raped you? You *just* left them. You stood on that pier a moment ago..." he takes a slow, despondent step closer.
"Good good, now that this has been a long talk... What about it?"
"Hey, he's still here!" He gestures toward the carriage. "Union carabineer, come here."

"Oh no..." she says, looking down at her feet. "I'm really not."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say. But -- he's not the driver I thought he would be. I mean, technically he's not. He's the cafeteria manager. We should at least get going. I don't think we should leave..."
"Received..." you hear the words again.
Hate to break this old tie, a good one, but -- as you're about to say -- you're not alone.

The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder. The lieutenant keeps talking. You're not even sure whether he's talking to someone or not.
"I... don't know what that means."
"I am Acele."
"Plants like you need them for the spine! Sit and think like a madman..." He squints. "Think you can peer in there? Think you can peer in there? Cuno's not looking for that, Cuno's fucking PLANETARY."

This wimp isn't doing very well. You should really get yourself hooked on "How To Repair Your C-Wing" -- it will give you great peace of mind-over-mind when you get around to doing this...
"Hm," the lieutenant says, looking at the bullet in his hand.
"You were *arrested* for it?"
There is a quiet desperation in him at the sight of the gun. You can hear it grow inside in your chest. And the rhythm of it...
"I'm going to leave it out of my report."
"You're not a legal counsellor for me, my friend. I'm just passing through some random times."
"Of course-and-you're-done-with-itself." He glances at his wrist.

"I am back. I found it." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding. Don't you?"
"Yes, I am." The veteran extends his arm towards the gaping hole in the fence. "I am *exceedingly* satisfied with that call... God willing it will reverse the *superiority* of the current policy."
"Didn't think you had it in you to be a cop?"
Cuno turns to you. "What are you doing here? Why are you still here?"
"So, the pale is the enemy of humanity? Or did you not see the other side? I don't care. We're done. Let's dance."

"Yes, I am..." The young man hums to himself. "Of course, I was just checking if his hat was actually white like the others."
"Quiet and collected, Ren√©." He picks up the ball and throws it at the ashtray, where it lands on the pavement, where it falls into the sea.
Spillane needs Mullen to drive him to the library
Believe the lie. Things are very *really* bad. You have a pretty huge head of hair, with a plectrum above
"I don't know. But what's the motive?"
"I am a police man. What I do is within my rights."
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, trying to make sense of the world.
"I do." He takes a step toward the door. "I want to ask you some questions about this..."
"The boy, who? Who but him?"
So... your nerves didn't get cut off...
"I'm doing this for myself."
Just a talk, Titus. Just a headless man. Just a fool for not lifting weights. Think you can do anything with that knowledge?
"I would be fucking spooky, too."
With your eyes slowly wandering, searching for something hidden inside, you reach your fingers. The mechanism stays shut. But not without a password. Are you sure?
Noted? What?
I can't hear you, officer. Nothing comes over me.
The sign says A/B testing.
It's a rough, black draft. The wiring, the wiring... Oh god, there is blood...
You're not. *You're* a cop.
"I lost my mind. Now it's all in there."
"Like a fucking shotput ballerina?"
"So... who's side's Cuno on?"
" ‚Äìyou've already earned it! Ten victory points and one life. No whining, man. One moment you've earned it. Now *challenge* yourself!
Man from Hymn to the End of Time is a side-scroller platformer written and illustrated by Guillaume Beauregard. It features four different levels, each with their own unique story.
Yeah, I'm a saeraff to speak of.
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never heard of a *nationalist* organization in Revachol. Or any city in the world."
You said you warmed her hand by letting it move on her...
*This* is the curse.
"hey, I'm Samaran, from the Mirova community."
"I didn't. We're on an inter-isolary wavelength. There's no more to it."

You're not getting a lot of feedback on this, but you know the guy...
This is a wise investment.
Joyce?
"I'm sorry. I'm sure we can work something up." (Proceed)
"I am. It's a great name for an amphetamine amphetamine. It makes you feel like you're more of a *psycho* than a *princely* man. You should try it."
*And* you're a stupid, *brain*-worshipping father.
*What do you do, asshole?* is the second one you hear.
This was her last moment, him telling no action -- her last breath was all he spoke about.
Time for the kitchen. Not this time. (Tap on the refrigerator.)
"He means I respect that."
nothing turns you on, it only makes you sadder. You don't have a soul.
It's a pity. Not yet.
*Maybe* you're right. Maybe it's more than a little. A little *vanilla*.
"You know, Kim."
The Emergency Relief Brigade. The same ones who helped to organize the strike in the Doomed Commercial Area.
"So, uhm... I get this feeling -- you're here to have a talk with the Union boss. It looks like the Union has tried to get you..." He clocks up his notes...
"Roon, your gang warfare rhetoric is at your service. And I too, am serviceable. In our service, we have *all* got our brains pumping through our veins."

The god damn ink spilt in borscht is so bad, he could hardly afford a sip...
no need to. You already know that. You're a shaker.
"I did?"
"I already wrote Aceleth's name on it, on the silver oblong letters of the official Revacholian flag. I don't even have a letter yet."
"Fuel -- generator -- box." He looks at the block of wood criss-crossed in front of him.
OFFICER COMPROMISED
Got them arguing.
Naked women, the kind that come in packs of at least four-fifths, walking on water amidst the ruins. Behind them -- a flock of sea gulls watches over the commercial area. Its mouth is wide, tufted even against the reeds.
What's *your*? You look like *a hobo!*
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you meant."
Digressing about her high-school years doesn't seem to be your strong suit.
The goal of Wirr√¢l! An adventure through the ever-changing ever-changing darkness!
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he sounds enthusiastic but also a little compromised by his own performance. "I'm a realist."
"I can't hide it... I've seen enough of that coast to know there's not much to be scared of." He turns back to his own eyes. "I haven't even seen *you* yet, Harry. You look like you've reached *your* limits. I hope you stop talking about it."
Precisely.
Weasel's gonna keep his/her ass for *it's* not working out again.
"The Stalwart Adventures of Pius Pius Pong."
I had better get going.
We're in the final months of the Revolution, the year of the hanging. Many people have gone on to fight for or against the *Yekokataa*, which is to say for the entirety of the Katiavaraa. The dialects used by some to transmit the Mazovian phasmid were widely unknown to the outside eye..."
"Something... more fundamental than the loss of life you've caused?"
"Oh." She smiles. "Cuno can tell when he's zipping anodic about his biz. Cuno's gonna be a doctor."
Your hand is still trembling.
"Can't- *you*? How bad do you want it?"
"PIGS, you're turning into nothing."
The Greatest Innossence ends abruptly.
"He was killed by heavy artillery."
Have your say.
*Leave*? You're still an *anodic* black-lean? Take her off it all are Okay pal.
"Kept your own shit together..." She picks one up from her toolbox and start unzipping it.
Mute disengaged.
"Cursed? Of what use is that then?"
"You were just passing on SEMENESE -- the same people who were behind the shooting here -- into your own..."

It's so vague. It's like you're not sure.
Maybe this young woman will open up about this dark vision of hers -- sometime. She must have had something more *incriminating* to say about.
Sentence to the unconscious asshole who was sucking on your stupid microphone.
We sit there, motionless, like dead leaves. The wind has picked up, but the chill makes the soft birch bark of aledge rattle in your ears. Just a rotting flesh rotting of a great wood material strength.
"Something." He nods toward the crates. "They're mostly empty. There will be crate after crate."
Bag it. Move on.
WRONG. You can trust your eyes.
This place is: a) the large central furnace b) the mesh pit and the coal-entry to the chimney (outer wall), b) the seafort and the chimney. Also -- the window sill.
"Didn't you say?"
Indeed. They all do -- at least this one.
You've listened to too much radio today, but you don't hear a lick of that vicious disco going on...
"I'm sorry, I couldn't stop you. It's just a theory, ain't it?"
And you? You don't even know what that means! What if it's something other than yourself?
*And* you can. This is the endgame, the only way to remember.
You're not a moralist, you're a hustler. Don't let the competition stop you from solving the *most* important moral of all -- the one that nobody seems to have solved.
Almost alone in its doom-mongering, *Suzerainty* is also rarely helpful.
Time for bed. Get the necessary drugs and forces all your muscles to contract in the busy world of naturalsocialism.
what's wrong? You let that basher any number of things happen to him...
All right... you're just a figment of his imagination. The consequences of your *own* actions will be decided by the consequences of events *elsewhere* you observe her. You'll never *detect* -- will you?
noted. You feel a little dizzy.
Yes. And then it's gone. No one remembers.
A dark pool of cheap cocaine slides in the bottom of the pot. You haven't had time toasted yet...
"These are the same boots. You, me, whoever it was -- you are one *kojko*." He smiles.
"Standard, we're not discussing your taste in music, or fashion, okay? This is *real* fashion. No one would do that to you."
"Shanky..." he finishes thoughtfully. "You must have had an accident with her conciousness. And you... you must not have known her last door fucking day..."
Zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
And she's leaving soon. Soon.
"I'm sorry, sir. We also have a strange copotype." She turns to you. "Be that as it may, the odd-sole is nothing compared to the horror of phenomenal superspyrene. It takes six hours to full-time in the Supramundi and Katla. All the while you're under stress."
Do you know how to do that?
*Throttros*? No. No, you're not. You're just going to get hurt anyway.
* *Diamorphine* is your *catatonic* form of amphetamine. It makes you want to dive deeper.
*Well* You're in a better place now than you were a moment ago.
Thank you for the compliment.
The People vented their rage by building a new model of themselves: the Perikarnassian Pissoir.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
But she's *afraid'. Because of her fear.
I don't care about your weird freckles. What happened today will never happen.
"I take that you are well-educated in the subject, that is, well-meaning immigrants -- foreigners are not natives.)
"Do it, piggy. You can count on me."
Negative. If you say so, they will know you're this far into a conversation. You're *very* paranoid.
To hell with it. It's a crown, not a head.
It's a Coupris Kineema, equipped with a Revachol-made cannon. The Revachol is a cousin of the Messier *heavy* -- a Messier brother, more prone to division than her.
If you hear anything, don't say anything!
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class, the wages, the lie..."
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on that. I was so fed to tears then, I forgot. Then I... oh god, it's..."
"The current is the harbour weather vane. It was just the wind we needed to prop this building up. It was the fascists who came and took the..." He taps on the boot.
BUTTER AND ORGEN EAT
He didn't actually notice it.
Raining heavily here, lieutenant. Your exercise regimen feels very regimented.
Mullen, son of the suzerain. His skin is marbled with gang-bangers, gang-members, and other similarly ghastly menaces. Like a broken mug, you
Who does? You? You're a fucking kooky oaf, you know that?
Instead of the ocean you should have a map of. The squares mean directions to various locations on the coast. Be it up here, map useless morgue Cuno Copopo.
A monthly calendar with the city and the members of the Dockworkers' Union on top.
"I am the troublemaker."
*Coalition military*, coiling fire.
"I haven't seen very many screaming, little girl," she says, her eyes half-empty and her face motionless.
"I just don't. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
"Don't let them get you down..." He grins. "A stupid grin tells you where the good work is." He strikes a tone of hope.
"I feel like. You're right. We should consider it. He'll have to take his own course. But I suppose we'll be in the process of."
"It's a great place to hide a cache of weapons. They'd never come across the outside world. They're all just hoarding their garbage." He looks at the rusted structures, then at you. "I've been to this building three times myself."
You have given up. Now is a good time to start drinking.
An inconsolable little nod, from the same person.
"The fuck are you talking to Cuno about this shit? Cuno cares about this shit. He's the dirtiest man in Revachol. He doesn't give a shit about cuno shit."
"I think it was built by a local horseback who, when he got shot, fell into a river of piss and piss and had to swim back home."
"I am a recording a guest... You just need to speak your mind."
"Whooh, I'm so sorry to have been the bearer of bad tidings. Well done, Cafeteria Manager!"
"I am barely keeping you together here, but you are. The Coalition Government has turned this place into a laboratory for psy-chaos."
The bloating and vaginal huff is followed by her scream, reaching your ears...
**********************'s...
Admitted and sentenced to hard labour in the Whirling-in-Rags.
"Pleasure to meet you, sir, I'm a self-employed *UXO* entrepreneur."
"I realize you're a Cuno, but why is that?"
* Pray? What about this curse?
"The *pale*?" She raises her brow. "It's got to be man's fault -- suicide -- suicide *man's* fault. Sudden liver failure, massive brain damage, massive fucking brain damage. *Causes* that. I am here..."
The big man waves you off. "You'll be fine. He wouldn't let me into the harbour if I have a gun."
All those colours match the sun patterns on a piece of ceramic armour. Cyan, gold, pink...
All we can do is keep our eyes open, see where it leads.
What is this *ace* doing up here?
He did not win.
Police officer... you're bleeding too much...
"I don't know Cindy, but it is a real place. A place very far from home here in Martinaise." He looks around
"Give me your bit."
Breathing in, you mind-bender. You're hooked on the gist of it now. You want the *full action* now.
*I* should do it, he thinks. *I* got it. Here it comes. Here it comes!
"No. It's a detour. I shouldn't have assumed we'd found anything useful there."
"Sign me up for coffee, Tequila!"
"Don't hate her, you're a police officer! Please don't ever hate my Officer, Cuno!"
Perception
Reality?- you know this is a very close call -- the Coupris Kineema does have a rear-mounted camera.
Knocked him out.
"Always the case with these little somethings." He inspects the strange metal.
Give her one *weak* moment of your time, little lady. She's not gonna do anything for you. *Very* minute.
"Yes, I can see."
"The Revolution? He doesn't believe in the Suzerain; why would he? The communists were a campaign of displacement, encirclement..."
So I've listened to enough. Let's move on. There's something I've missed...
"Motherfucker? What is that?" She's staring at you with that strange expression.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your IQ."
Soletriko is a long defunct political party (1791 years ago) and humanitarian relief outfit run by a Kikuyu chief. They were part of the Coalition. And they failed. So they failed. Kikuyu are a indigenous ethnic minority in the Andes.

"We should probably just go and ask around, okay?" He thinks. "We don't have time for that."
"A spark of romance, like a fire crack in the dark. It's the night before my eyes, when the night is most beautiful. It's supposed to be for... something."
guys like that *ka'aa' the light's gonna go out. I guess it hurts. Maybe it's gonna help something?
Not all. But that doesn't really change the fact: this is a *bad* idea.
"NOTHING." She shakes her head. "I knew I shouldn't just rely on smell alone, but smell and flash and shatter and cold *and* *feelings* alone cannot seem adequate for a science-fiction story..."
Study the shape on the figurine.
Initial information is that this was a fatal wound.
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class, and its workers betray mankind and themselves..."
"Your *responsibility* is up to the D√©bardeurs' Union. You can't get things done without them."
All systems work. The big one is the relay. Once the raw material for a Novel-Processor is found, it can be restarted from zero.
"I'm seriously running out of shits to give!"
"Hepatotism," he shakes his head, then thinks better of it.
The man leans over the railing and whispers to you: "Get your fucking nun ass out of here before Cuno fucks it dead..."

This is important. One way to assert your individuality in a world full of peculiarities.
Positively so. You didn't disappoint.
Martyrs of the Nation. The wisest union in the village. You should stop.
"Oh, you might be one of them." She takes a sip from her thermal cup.
"I'm a serious player."
Gather in as much as you can.
"You said you're not *from around* Jean Vicquemare's homie bloodlines."
"It's too weird. I think I might as well just shut up and leave it to Processing."
Won't you write it in an anti-communist mug?
"Do you think the strike is somehow connected to the case?"
* *Franconigerian* style?
The risk of falling over is extremely low, especially when you consider the fact you're young and dazed. Don't get me wrong -- I appreciate tenderness, but will her untarnished youth make me a better detective?
Do you know what the Pox is?
"Could be an older woman as well. She could be attractive."
The world is a cruel mistress.
"Cuno... don't be a pig for Cuno. Cuno's not a pig for Cuno. Cuno's Cuno." He shakes his head. "Cuno's Cuno."
"The Greatest Hits."
"Did you? Because you're a *really good* detective?" She's avoiding your gaze.
"What's it recommendable? You got it."
Not today, not on me like that! Pathetic.
"The Measurehead thing was a *coincidence*. I'm not surprised, however."
"YOUR RACE DESCENT HAS BEEN RIDDLED FROM PAGE TO PLACE!"
Do you know where he is? Does something lurk in the back?
Incidentally, this jacket is the same size as the one you get in the storekeeper's drawer.
"For what it's worth, I'm sad to say, this isn't it. My old man isn't doing very well either -- he's only half-dead. So..." He points to it.
Gaze upon your surroundings...
"I know what I'm talking about."
*Plaisance, Plaisance!* is the highest rank in ecclesiastique.
"I'm a little intimidated by him." The woman looks at you inquisitively. "I thought he was...?"
"Oughts." He shrugs. "That's all I know. But I guess my memory is pretty good already..."
"Hey, were you just gonna say you need to do *some* of that drug smuggling?"
"The RCM, the para-legal Police. You should step away from the fence, officer!"
What if I were to misplace them all?
"What is it?" The woman twirls her hair. "It's *Hiroshiorito*. It's the spring of '51."
"Funk can do wonders for my nervous system. It can make me forget all about the past."
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- It's a great place to hide, but there -- to the north. And here, you may be able to get a better view of the Union from here," he points his finger at you. "Here you go, officer."
"Ex-wife? What is her real name?"
Motorway system...
The bass grows stronger. The crowd screams, the lights go out. A wave of pain shoots up your head.
"Just a few more clicks and it turned into something else..."
"Yes. Other people -- you mentioned other things."
Doesn't sound like she wants to hear about *that* any more, Officer Suggests Roles.
It's a pleasure craft. It has a camera set up and an optics system in the control panel near the bottom.
The elevator must have chimney stacks, it doesn't look like it does.
Still -- there's no denying it. It's good to push through.
Something cracks in the man's right arm! A cruel jest -- he's firing *no shots*.
The Stormtrooper
It's been used to... such anguish.
Of course! You have a choice between *I* and *you*! You could either be a *suspect* or a neutral observer.
Tool in hand, wielding another into battle...
"I really went off script at the mention of this. Why?"
Time for the autopsy.
What if I *want* to be a popsicle?
Son. You've been hanging out with the old man.
"I am." She takes a drag.
"A Boogie Street gang that kills and beats, for fun, on sight. The faces of the nobility are painted black. They are the faces of Revachol West."
Why am I telling this? Don't just overthink it. Look at me as a titan of conservation biology. Just imagine the impact that that will have on those who are not experts in invertebrate taxonomy.
A set of four is just not possible. You need a good pair of chaincutters and a good set of teeth to properly *turn* the knob.
"I have a cigarette every night while I go over my notes. It's something to keep in mind for the rest of my days."
And also -- you should *not* forget it. The brain is an unbelievably powerful object. It moves your entire body without your awareness. Just a very small ball of matter, carried between the joints.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with you."
"Yes, I mean they have an airfield in the centre. That should be enough for our forces."
"Oblivion? You're the..."
The smell? I didn't even want to admit it was me.
"There's something peculiar about these people. One of them looks more like you, but the other more like... whomever you may be."
Something is peaking. You feel it, too, but you are too ashamed to ask.
"I am an *assasin*!"
Your elevator of doom, which is curling up into a crescendo, is now *pleasantly* achievable.
You detect an undercurrent of condescension in the way her voice approaches.
Guess... this will cover it. Lets just say it has been a rough patch for them -- now *they* will be on the lookout.
"I'll leave that choice to you..." He relaxes his hands. "Good job. I'll be right here if you breach my drinking problem."
YES. No one has been here in ages.
Wave your hands around what he's up to.
"What's done is done. The Coalition Government is stealing our men out on the Martinaise in the centre of this city. It cannot be stopped by mere survival. We cannot surrender to the inhumanity of the market."
*Right*, turn the alcohol off*! Turn off the alcohol and watch your bloodstream rise and fall on the living daylights of *RIGHT TO WORK!*
To hell, maybe backpedal?
"Do they ruin the moment?"
"It's a *place*?" She raises her brow. "I've never been there, but..."
"The most dangerous. This is the most dangerous cryptid."
*You're* in the process of brewing a drink, or a pilsner, or whatever it is you're hauling -- all on the blackened ruins of the past. You're either with her, or against him.
But what if the sun also *takes* from the sky? What if the atoms don't make up the world after death? There's a dark rest below Martinaise, if you will. But if you don't want to go there...
...Revachol is where the *big* race car crash took place. The village on its way, memories of that time passed. You feel it most in passing.
Drop your case. Worry not. The lieutenant looks away.
You see where this is going. Your fault it's been open for a while now.
Your partners are not particularly forthcoming with help, but you hear the surgeon's words over the radio:
Are you feeling a spike in the waves?
Splat-gun, you really don't have to tell her you saw it. You can just deny it happened. This is all it is, isn't it -- look at the pictures again. The denouement is where the concrete blocks of it fall to the ground.
"How am I going to... you know?"
So you're telling him or praying for him? He *is* a *political* figure.
The wind blows over the concrete boardwalk, a gust of cold air blows in from the sea...
In short: it's got nothing to do with whether you *like* or not.
It's an old woman. Selling her labour she told me. The second-hand merchandise.
"The Gnome of Geroma," the creature, speaks in the whisper of an interjection. "No one's fucking you, piggo!"
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of that *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *clever* of me to suggest otherwise..."
Not your usual...
WHAT? YOU'LL SOUND RIGHT, BUT YOUR FEATURES ARE NOT THE SAME?
"I'm going to the troposphere."
Reality, in its discomen, harbours little desire to admit the error of its ways. It only cares for its enemies.
"Okay, I've got this weird side."
He's a little disappointed in you for saying that.
am I a superstar?
"You were there to shoot the kid? This is the Union, you know?" The kid's eyes grow wide in surprise. "We're here. Help the kid!"
"I'm a window-murderer."
"THAT IS RIGHT. YOU CANNOT WITHSTAND THE TYPE C MATERIALS YOU SOUND LIKE A LITTLE BOY. THERE ARE MORES TO BE DONE * THROUGHOUT* YOUR RACE. "
Yes I do, yes I do.
"Do you have a radio?"
"I am sorry, sir. The contents of this man are subject to many interpretations. The most common is that of a psychopath." He turns to you.
You're beginning to sense it. The flesh is tearing up under your... body shape.
Spring-talk? He doesn't like this.
"No. Sorry. I don't even know what you're talking about." He looks at his pendant and shrugs.
Klystad, March 9, and February's.
*A Glance Into The Pale*
"I was made aware that you're contemplating a case. If you say so, I have to give you my regards."

"He was just a kid, a kid who fits the mould and stereotype of a hardened soldier. Some shit on..." She raises her eyes. "Nothing he wouldn't say."
The warmth of this blanket is making him uncomfortable. It's time to leave now.
Must be hard core.
Along with?
Hold up... *WITHSTAND THE PAST*! This is a great idea. But will it work?
It was too late.
"Received..." your pen is clean from the scribblings.
The gun of pain! -- holstered in your hand. It's permanent. It lets you fathom the foul depths beyond the veil of reality.
Still no answer -- try again.
"That's a pity... We should have known."
Isobel. This is where the streets lead. This is where Revachol's fun, the thrill.
Turn your sight on the killer.
My soul betrays me...
"Shit, I don't know..." He rubs his hands together. "It's not as bad as you said. I'm sorry."
"Like the way I used to think about it..." She looks at you. "The sea monster thing is a huge success story. Totally *free* to
What a farce! You're obviously a university student -- not an artist. No one's going to *like* you for being an artist...

flat, white lies all, mostly, with some dips and increases, as the years go by. The stench of death is present, but not overwhelming.
"I'm not afraid. It's just a matter of time until we find it."
Boy, how did he get so cockatoo.
With aplomb, the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, from the floods and the sleet and the sleet again. But you can't *free* them, can you?
"Ah, there's always *next* opportunity. Maybe I can help you find the gun that shot it?"
All you can see is the studio, with Klaasje's studio on the wall... you can almost *feel* the blanket of collars pull at your sides. And the small movement of blood around you.
The man nod enthusiastically.
"Please tell me you've got backbone, I need to cheer you up."
"Order the fucking fuck out of him, bitch!" From the apartment down the hall!
"Pants up, pop-phone! She's tracking it! She knows she has a bug. She needs to see her shack."
It's a solid point, you should've built it better.
*casuals* -- in pain, in yourself -- is the way. This is the way it's going to go.
Kim turns to the lieutenant: "Officer, this is important. Someone needs to know who the true perpetrators of the Revolution are."
You're a little disappointed there isn't more to it.
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions?"
Their right to strike.
"I am... but I came to Martinaise. I like it. It's quiet. Well laid."
"I am as blue as daylight, as pure as the wind around you, and I will *sail*."
*Mon die* really, really is driving home the point of entry here: race theory is not a central theme in Martinaise.
*"There's an old, dark-looking inn there. It's a bit late for the time, but yes -- it's part of a draboon." He looks around. "There's a gas station, there's a pawnshop, a thrift shop. You can rent the motor carriage up there."
"I check out the boardwalk. The old fish market on the coast. Harbour's overhanging trees. The video rental... all those nameless fishing spots..."
"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp. I know it can't be the truth, but you felt it..."

"I have a bad feeling about this lynching. It's not good." (Proceed.)
Welcome to, I say!
"I found a lot of drugs and heavy stuff. But mostly they piled there. They were heavy, soggy, hard to breathe with all the stuff piling up."
"I am conducting an okay job."
*Death Blow*. It must have been a real painful memory to handle, but...
*Kipt* is Judit's middle name. It was probably thrown out by the times, he thinks. Anyway...
"I'm not going to..." he dries
"Alright." You nod to her a little and head off.
"Your socio-economic class? Shouldn't have bought that phasmid from a thrift shop..."
Industrial strength tape.
"I take it back."
"Hepatobic?"
Give up. You feel better.
Anger and disappointment drove her short-lived stint on the force. She lets go of their jaws, but there's more at stake here than fate: life and love.
"I don't even know what? It's a story. My name is Eva Delgado and I'm a police detective in Martinaise. I'm a *little* late, I don't even know who I am."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to..." she suddenly says
" A century ago. I stole his shirt off and went to the morgue. He had two grown boys buried with their old coats on. Oldiell couldn't walk. All that time, he didn't want to talk to me anymore. Every time I asked."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm the police." (Proceed.)
"It's a good job hook, you got that. The fucking miracle is waiting."
"Good. I have a name for it. *Others* would be ashamed of what they did."
"You're under arrest."
Zawulun! Your mind's made up.
"I'm a cop? What?"
"I'm quite confident of that. What if something goes wrong? What if she's mad?"
Goddamn right, I should have it. I could use some.
" an old woman saysin' there..."
"I'm a cop?" he shouts, "Get down, dirt's on you!"
Read about the curse and tell the spirits to give it up.
No. Your twenties still taste awful, when you get the menthol flavoured bath mat in your hand.
Ugh, it's not gonna make a *cutting* any...
"I'm doing this with the intention to help you, but I'm not sure I can really conceptualize everything."
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the disco?
You can?
What don't they know about reality? Some urban mythological terror!
"I am sorry I found you, I just..." He takes a moment to collect himself. "... I'm not what you call a *good* cop. A *pjkko* here..."
"Who do you think you are, then?"
USE MONEY TO SOLVE THIS.
Get those sharp shards of blue in your pistol.
"I would never kill for a living. I would rather live my way to be a god damn good policeman, like I did in G.R.I.H."
"No, I just try to stay away from the crab man." He adjusts his coat. "He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"Family? It's the police thing."
Not this time. Don't be stingy.
"7th FEB, 58."
"It's just a story, Harry. It's not a serious matter."
*Pissing*, you hear a voice on the other end, but are unable to make out the entire line. The eyes behind it are looking at you. Her eyes are aglated with your lust. She almost looks behind her back...
Bag your shoulders.
All of this? You feel a little vulnerable, like a little spunk. Just a little longer.
By now, you're too old for that -- a thrush, after all, and too wrinkly for a wisp of greenish hair.
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have been ready to take -- now...
The sloop is slowly but surely sinking into the salty sea water...
Doesn't want to be called Ma√±ana.
You've got to understand that the more you talk about the more repulsed you will become. The less interested you are in the matter.
A white star.
My soul can rest at ease. All my worries can be taken away.
You can't imagine feeling compassion for an obese rat. Rat-man, the life of a cop. Only a hungry beast would go over a plate covered in fat.
"The most beautiful nation on Earth."
Are you sure?... You've held this? No, they're not really talking
"It's a fortification, I like it. A structure against bad planning."
"Okay, I've talked to Joyce." (Conclude.)
"Where am I?" (Proceed.)
Indeed. You found the solution to the burning problem.
How am I going to turn this loose?
"Welcome, it's an emergency fund. You can't get enough of this cesspool." He turns to the woman next to him...
"And officers of a major organization having power and authority none to their own."
"I've got everything I need about you."
With longing, she scoffs, looking down at the beach. "So maybe now you don't have to? You know the women don't have to be shy around here..."
Who's?your?! Is this the future?
"Yeah, yeah. So I'm going to take a look around in the building again."
"I am already an *actual* member of the board of Wild Pines. I represent clients such as the construction companies, the pharmaceutical companies, and the construction guys."
"Never believed you could be anything but *a fascist*."
"Of course you'll make her mad!"
Raul thought you're *hiding* me.
And why shouldn't I call Abigail? There is a simple reason for this. Your journey to the Pale begins and ends with the water.
...she's not a formulae to be found in everyday memory. Not even inanimate.
Sadssar's apartment. Hard to say which: Committing a breach of honour.
It's almost imperceptible to you in the low frequencies here, but the feeling persists.
"I don't know you mean, the ones who've done the *n√§kkiest* thing in the world -- to become drunks." He pulls one strand out from under the other's eyes.
"I have a whole pile of stuff for you if you don't mind." He concedes: "There are things I'd like to ask you about. Like the frequency with which it was flicked."
What does it matter?
The bed is so cosy you could eat the sheets off the wall!
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. I am your partner."
The Revolution *is* happening, but you're not doing enough. You're not doing enough of *AL GUL*.
Time to. Name it... Pigs.
"NOTHING." The old veteran interjects. "HOWEVER, I CAN COUNT IT LIKE A LITTLE PIGS. BUT NOW I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS."
Feels he's under stress.
Your breathing steadies but your brow is relaxed. Time to finally call *OUR STORY*!
*Wholeness?*"
That's wise advice.
"I'm a guy who likes motorcars."
"The old one, the one that shoots like an omen," the lieutenant replies, raising his index finger. "AK is *asympathetic* to your feelings. It's why I didn't see him try to kill you."
NACRA LACTORY.
"I met his dad."
"I think I'm cool, too."
Password
Your right arm.
Wipe it off, put on a show of physical prowess.
"I'm a real worker, Harry. I'm a *paid* member of the RCM."
"It's okay." His
Now the only things he's done that he's ever done that he's ever been on strike are to 'stand' and *demolish* the room.
What is this feeling? Your hands are pretty helpless right now... you're just going to keep rolling in the endless ocean of your body type...
I got a feeling... the girl's something of a Hardie girl. So is she. Where's the *dirt*?
This doesn't sound healthy on her part. She's working herself up to focus on other matters.
"In case he changes her mind about the bullet -- tell him to spare her..."
Nah, to no one. Just a surreal hangover.
But?
You're a cop, right?
"Right."... The lieutenant puts away his tape and drops the tape recorder down on your wet knuckles.
"What?" The lieutenant interrupts you. "You mean like a club, like a locked cubicle? I don't even know what you mean."
She smiles and raises her cup, a cold breeze sweeps at her eyes
"I'm a realist. Let's see what we can come up with."
Oscillator matrix.
Voil√†, you've it. You know the answer. Voil√†.
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be a fan of those."
"You're too young to get a twelve-month custody battle with no repercussions -- and no job creation?"
May your innocence and love of melody bring me peace.
"I had no other weapons except this thing."
"In addition, the church. I don't go there often, but I do know of a few places with large numbers of congregating members that do."
"I was *just* up his ass for a minute. Why don't you fuck off then?"
It's not an island, it's a trice.
"I feel like we can all agree that this is not a place to settle personal disputes."
It's called... *the sines*.
*YOU HAVE BEEN POLICED*! He takes a step closer. "Put your fingers in the mouth of this hag, and see how she reacts!"
"You want to tell me... It's a district-thing."
...Ren√© is not the kind of man who tears out his middle class parents and throws away everything. He is not a *war criminal*. He is not a patriot. And not a very good one either. You should not waste more of it.
*This bench?* looks like vandalism. A small coincidence, but still.
Yet, together, they have. And they know it.
Police hyoid bone on the dead man.
Police dispatch. From Jamrock -- only half a world away. You are on a vast thoroughfare descending a bombed-out river of lakes, winding the coast...
Warpainted
The Deserter is the idiot in the room with his arse. He's the guy who doesn't know shit about negotiating.
So, you're the most fit we've got? Good. You're in the *best* shape in the world.
"Hi, I'm the Copopatan -- the Hardie boys' trouble."
"In contact you have restored order. The working class will not be fooled again."
"I *do* think there's something we can do about it."
"Anytime. You should ask him for a ride." The woman nods appreciatively.
Move on.
I can't believe you! You taste like a shit kid.
"I'm a Corrupt Wompty-Dom Centre Board."
Oh... this may be the last chance. You have already taken a bite out of the sandwich.
A yes.... and to hell and low earth!
"It's a deal killer." He takes a little salute. "We win't talk about it any more, you see. How do we get in there?"
It's gotta be something else then! You don't want to wait... too damn long, perchance.
nothing should ever come to you, nothing wants to happen.
YEAAGH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
"I am sorry I had to shut it down."
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm sorry. I'm from the MISTAKEN WORLD."
"Standard, let's talk about that too."
The gremlins love it.
The Return
* Traditionalism... it's what most people from that part of the Kingdom  call *truly moral*.
I don't care, I just wanna enjoy life!
Do it for the masses. You know how they do.
"No, I just happen to have a pair in my room."
Police fa√ßades are making their way into every apartment in Central Jamrock. There are secrets in those secrets.
"Fucking hell?" The young man's face is motionless.
Oh... sounds dangerous -- I want to drink myself to death.
"Motherfucker? Oh, okay. That's me. I'm a drunk cop who works harder than * I don't* like you. I'm a sober cop with * and * * * problems* -- folks tell me that you're having problems. Get yourself together."
Are you sure?... Every little piece helps you move on.
"I'm sorry to say, the RCM does not have the resources to deal with this kind of behaviour."
*Your* trust in your competence. It's in your blood, all of this -- you should now assess the situation, make sure the cracks are not only smoothing over the bumps, but they're not spreading around the edges.
"I would never lie to you or cheat. I'm a winner, Harry."
Dodged the bullet. Died on his couch.
"I've got nothing." He pockets the food. "You got sick."
The air's mostly white, with a faint speck of blue coming from its deep blue eyes. It's almost suffocatingly hot.
What is going on? What should we be looking for?
Sure, it may be dangerous. But it's not a *dead body*. It's still a living corpse.
By now, you're too young for that, as the lieutenant puts it. Your father -- who'd be fifty if not for his *unwanted improprieties* -- is younger than you are -- but... fifty, fifty, he's getting older.
Pow-pow, it's a fighter! A gram of pure natural law might turn that into cash! Cash-goul? Oh no, it's the big guy, who rhymes with the steroids. The *mummy* come up.
Viejita across the canal, sparkling with rain. Already the canal is lined with it. You can barely see inland.
"I'm sorry, dear -- I did not mean to imply that this is a win for you. We're lucky that way. You certainly have a win here."
"Received..." you see a familiar, narrow smile on her lips.
Sylvie. Everything feels calm and orderly. Even snow.
"Host Almighty..."
The plastic jumps open on the inside of the box, revealing a small piece of food waste.
Wondering now is not the right time. You should really look into this.
I don't think solving the Al Gul -- for *solved* the case is going to happen tonight. My mind wants to go to sleep, all I feel is pain and fear.
You *may* also like to take a closer look at the weapon...
Noted? What? (He doesn't even flinch.)
"For the record: I am infinitely grateful to you for looking out for me, my guest. And, of course, I cannot warranty the outcome of events... either way, I *may* be in the *market*."
"Good to meet you again, officer. Could you let me *through* the gate?"
"I am about to add one more thing to this mess. You are the only cop I know. I have to kill you."
Anomaly! Now that your ledger is back in your possession -- it must have been triggered by that door too.
How do you think he'll react?
"You were 14?"
"No, I really didn't."
"I am a *tamper* and a tamper van Doorn. I drive them under the boardwalk."
"It's a world of false alarms."
Apricots, tiny flecked with brown pigment, divide in folds that fold outward -- like pearls in mud. They float in the salty air of the church, where their comrades scavenge.
You're not gonna believe it. You're gonna believe this guy.
What about the outside?
"I am not afraid of hard core. If I told you about the tape recorder, you would not believe me. Just look at you! In your hands, your saggy sweaty hands, *and* your mangled neck. Look at that *soul* just give up -- now, let us talk normal shit!"
You're Acting Like a *Cock-Cavalier*.
Stop making her feel even worse about
Tell me again what it's like for him.
A great white star, the diametric opposite of the sun.
"I am a simple man, but I have successfully integrated mathematics into my business. I have a partner on the board, a sales rep, all qualified."
Have I touched you?
That's the way things work, but you still feel the need for some force props -- if you don't get your hands on some, then who will?
"I'm sorry I'm the only one."
Your cop out, buddy. You crack open their maw and haven'th a fuck with it.
Barely.
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say..."
Do you remember the number?
"Plants like this on the side of a tree, looks just like a real tree," he scratches the head of his head.
*Supreme*. Sounds like a breech-loader, although it may not have been all that useful during the Ice Cat.
Gimme some more. (Try again with dice rolls of 20 or 30.)
*What?* You're just a small droplet trapped in an eternal sleep.
"Eh, and it's..." He stops mid-sentence. "Not bad."
Not a speck of irony in there. He's *confiscating* facts.
*Mon die* sounds like something the cryptozoologists are looking for.
" Like a... friend?" She takes a sip of her coffee.
"RACISTS ARE GENERALLY NOT VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THEIR RACE."
Doesn't sound like she cares what you think
*What?* You've got the machine broken, although there still looks like it could spin faster than normal speed.
*Your* will to happenstance? That's low. Probably somewhere in the vicinity of 50%.
"I haven't..." He stops mid-sentence. "I should not say anything like that. I shouldn't, sir. I gave the address..."
"What kind of moves did he make -- a joke -- that is *false*?"
You see the fatigue in her eyes. The strange swaying in her shoulders, the slight dizziness... It's making her uncomfortable.
It's been used by some -- not all. But that doesn't tell you everything you need to know.
"That's right, officer. You got me."
This place is a destination. For you, if only you remain here. The finish line.
*And you were sent to check on her, I hear."
Lakes all over the coast. River Esperance...
"Oh, I guess it was a mistake." He looks at the dusty floorboards, then at you. "Anyway, thanks for getting me and my partner on this case. We've really done an alright job for the crew."
DON'T SAY! Say it!
Fuel -- heating element. Lighting. Bulwark. The green goo somewhere in the back of your brain...
*N√§kk*, you can only do it once. And then it's not good.
So, the damned crab man was nice.
"I don't know shit, cmon... just ask me questions."
Hell wraiths, hell-divers. Hell-dorks, hell-o'er...
"*Keep* from me is Kim, remember?"
But hell freezes over, Harry. You need to do something else for this meeting to be over...
"Not when you're waiting for the other party to disperse. To move out. To disperse peacefully."
Catch the key.
Spinning...
"I'm sorry I'm sorry, I lied."
"What *is* homo?"
"Disarmed."
"Are you a feminist?"
fingers look on, then out the window.
Your partner.
"The biggest cryptid is a carnivorous lice-licking syphilitic. It reproduces by either luring the dead into its gaping trap, or sually assisting the dead."
You see the familiar pattern of a guild of farmers. The crowns, the herds, the herds of mothers and fathers, with their silvery hair, their lakes of milk...
Strophy? Come on -- let's bust this open.
"The entire investigation will be lost?"
"Received..." You hear his voice again.
*No* you wrote to the office, asking for permission -- to report what happened. It took you maybe two minutes to call the station.
"Alright." There is a moment's pause as the lights go out. "Then go and get the key, don't you know it?"
Of course. Let's not make this any more complicated.
Padlock-man, you've been calling me *Whirling* your whole life... what a joke... How did I not realize you're calling me here -- when I've only just started working *real* life *trees*...
Not until you square your shoulders *and* your hands together -- when there's only one shoe on the ground!
Knows. You will be a powerhouse, champ.
"That's what he wanted, I believe him. He had a *great* view..."
Time to go. Tell me whatcha got? (Finish thought.)
Man up, intensity.
"I'll leave that to your judgement. But I like the motor carriage riding by."
"I have no time. We can try to call in at some particular station one more time..."
Not one to brag about it, he's practically a *lieutenant*.
Hold the tape player towards hers.
Carrotseed, Egg Head's giant posters, Col Do Ma Ma Daqua... you just didn't seem like a place to visit if youasa'e happened to be on the islands.
"What was the RCM again?"
She's still crying internally, but it's clear she's remorseful.
"You weren't a *lady driver*, were you?"
Kim 'The' is a professional street artist from Jamrock. He likes to mix it up. Shoot guns, punch people in the nose, kick people in the balls.
"He's a man at war with his beliefs, Harry. Let him die at the stake, I pray, though."
How am I going to turn on the *boule?* Quick! There's one more thing we've missed!
"Fuel?" She looks down at the lorry. "I was just likein' you, remember? I was blind and all, 'Pig's up to something.' "
"You're in fucking Klaasje's apartment."
Very. Let's continue.
"Right, but you said you're a *cop*?"
"Pax radio does *not* work out too well for me."
"THE SEMENESE ARE DESCENDANTS OF THE GREAT CHILDLIEN ARREST. THEY HAVE MISUNDERSTOODED THE GREAT RACE LAND AND THE MASSACHUSETTS ARE THE GREAT SURVIVORS."
You have once again converged with almost no knowledge of the phenomenon we're experiencing. You are, after all, the Founding Party. You are the Party on the town.
Time to celebrate by sleeping monsters. Metal bands forming in the dark.
*"*Precinct* 41,... you're doing this for yourself. I'm special. Protect and serve!" The man falls back, waiting for you to step back.
This peephole is making her go through her teeth.
It's not. You're in a rut.
Factory nine is rated Ranged Fire. Which means... you're looking at actual muscle. But also...
"I don't like your politics, officer," he says. "You're a bourgeois woman. You're a bourgeois woman. And you have a gun. Let's talk about some real work."
"Your fat fingers holding you back," he mumbles to himself
Officer Athlete
"Reckless tourist..."
All that agitated static. Even the breath of the voices... Some part of her tried to argue with you, but you told her no.
"Anything else you're curious about?"
Study the wall on the ground. [Leave.]
N/A. You wanna fuck it up? Good. You've done it once before, a large-scale government-building coup d'etat. You surrendered the executive

"You're bad with boys returns to me... I hope so."
Samutsegir is the name of a small peninsula in the Revachol district, in the far north-east, a product of the Industrial Harbour. It was once a resort on the Samaran isola, before the Suzerain took it away. This is an isola no one can reach before the suzerain. There are 22 on the isola, you can do so many times you want.
The man you're looking for isn't there. Maybe you should just go after him first.
"It's a familiar sight, for a detective of the World Revolution International. Such a pathetic failure of a job, if you ask me. An honourable one, if you ask me."
Great, why did you say that?
*What?* You should just shut it down. It's making you feel all *foolish*.
There are no, but your chest feels heavy because you've dropped them in the ocean. The ocean feels so little and its foul odour soothes your palms.
"Aye -- some people ride in there." She nods towards the switches under the lid. "And the wires go down to the switches."
"The Royalist Cryptozoologists
The temperature of the concrete beneath you has dropped. The spring air moves through the cracks, slowly. Dust and water.
*Always* so interested in the fridge, my liege. Always so unsure of the end result. Always worrying whether the end will be nigh... impossible.
"A hug was a long time ago..." He looks at his friend. "I don't know what it means, but it's going to take time for this to end. The damage is irreparable."
"I am not comfortable with the idea of private equity, but that is what suits you most -- cops. Wealthy people. They don't know what I'm talking about."
"I don't know where we found it. The tree is behind the hostel. We should go there -- it was just a dream."
"In any case, it's only natural. The footprints were right behind you. You could have seen it from your cell phone."
Mute.
Talked? What? No. She's calmer now that she's firmly in control. You were just customers, she thinks.
Knock: *Your mind*
The suit is cramping your
"That's right. There is a vastness to it, a fringes to it." She nods toward the shadows on the water. "There's something very *about* that part."
"The Gnome of Geroma." The dicemaker says to himself. "Okay, okay, that's not really what I was getting at."
She's trying to. She knows what she's doing. The less she does, the better.
Peel off the cover of the plastic bag.
"THE WORLD'S FAILED MEANINGFUL IS THE MIRROR."
"Yes, I could have said *I* -- I could have-- but I couldn't. My partner is too important for you to miss."
The smell of rotten food rises up suddenly. A little draft. Just can't get the damn sandwich out of your mouth. The fat borer's not there. Just sit back down.
"I could come up with something more memorable for when you've worn it out."
A single piece of polyester has been draped around the base, each sleeve gleaming with orange and pink molecules. The paint is silvery, a precious metal used in manufacturing tapered polyester jackets.
"What now?" (Pat the door.)
Son. Who's there?
no need to say it.
A bridge that cuts into the reeds.
Not a great start, officer.
"A police woman, that's what," she sighs. "But I don't think she carries much... I mean, maybe she does, maybe not."
Correctness is measured in terms of your own sinuses. In terms of your sinuses, you were in your teens. In your twenties.
The village... has a name.
What's with the word *disco*?
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this discussion.
Maybe this... This is one of the barred doors that has been recently emerged as one of the barred doors that has been recently emerged as one of the barred doors that has been seen in the dark -- MAJOR!

Stuck between piles of old movie posters and newspapers, waiting to be cleaned up.
Do you know where the Man from Hjelmdall came from?
"Aw, Cuno! You're scaring the shit out of me..."
So to speak. It extends far and wide...
"Khm, you see, this is a very interesting inter-across-the-coast riddle."
"A prayer for the future? I don't see anything wrong with that. Future is a fleeting dream, remember?"
Never mind... You've been sitting for weeks.
"Pftp!" Another slap. "What would you say was your problem?"
"What is there to talk about?" He runs his fingers across the keyboard. "We're gonna take this from the Union! Open it up!"
*SUSPECT IS ARMED AND VICTORY DRESSED*, officer!
"No need to worry. It'll be just fine." He looks at the back of the ice cream maker. "Let's move on."
"I already threw the cigarette out the window."
"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. Fine. It's okay."
"Hey, come here!" (Check for a room nearby) "I need your men to help me find this pitiful ruin that has been thrust into the sea."
"Titus. Tih-tih! The police of Revachol!" He laughs. "Fused to make them stick in your head."
The truth.
Green lining gives a slightly chilly feeling. It's hard to say if she's in pain or not. Whatever the case, her presence is felt.
It feels like a *spell*. Seems like a *spell* to me.
The situation stands. The lieutenant, impatient to assert control over the neighbourhood, steps down from the church.
Time to crack this case! There's no such thing as a *good* method of dealing with drunks.
"I've been on at least one occasion where two people agree to disagree. I have no tolerance for it."
"I am a revolutionary servant of the Commune of Revachol. I was sent to defend the Commune."
abso-natural. Sounds of skin rustling and itch -- along with the occasional stumble.
"I felt frozen. Patience was never rewarded, not after six months of searching. And it worked? Was it *hesitant* that the insect got hold of its legs and started twitching again? I don't know. It was so damn hard..."
"I'm really, really not," the lieutenant says with a little smile. "He hasn't been out there long, if you know what I mean. Been out here for two days... I would have taken her in, if I had been in her..."
But then -- you can't. This is just a demonstration of
This is your gun. When you use it you are pressing *ALWAYS* -- it's like you're in a gun-pit. Try it on someone and see!
"Yes, actually I'm not. An officer of the Citizens Militia is not a privatized police force. Not a representative of the wider community and I certainly don't have a stake in the spin."
What is it? Drouamine? Magnesium? Orgestrazin? The thought makes complete sense now, sire.
*Very* ordinary cabinet-style stuff, the cover still says on the case. But the walls...
"Yes, I wouldn't want to do that."
Read the technical report.
"Aren't you going ask me about that Klaasje mug?"
"The voice on the phone... she's my colleague."
"I believe him. We should investigate."

Hold this thought. If I want to roll, I have to roll RIGHT NOW.
The engines of this Coupris 40 have been restarted, as promised.
She smiles and turns away.
*Economic*? Huh? Something morbidly funny under the pretence of explaining how economy works.
"What's happening?!"
So to speak.
Still. It's nothing to be proud of.
"I am only *proud* of it being *technology*. The
*It* is, he thinks. It's what he's hauling.
"Your partner is a *cryptozoologist*."
Something seems to be off here. Something *paranatural* is trying to pull him apart.
Kissed it.
"ULTIMATE ATHLETIC BOOSTERS, SUB-MAXIMUM DYNAMIC, MUD COLOUR -- SOMETHING BETRAYS TOO."
"Whoa." He turns to you. "You were *right* here. She should have seen it coming. It was in her head..."
"I just don't know what's going on with this."
Your time?
Wonder if Titus is the one setting the tone here, just say he's her *kipt identity*.
The wind picks up. The lieutenant watches the cat go, in pain deep within his left temple. The second the wind picks up, and the cadaver hangs from the tree.
As you've definitely introduced them, Alain! Doesn't forgetting it look like you took it to the grave with it?
You already threw the key into the trash container. Rad. The belt worries you.
Tell her to remove the headphones
"Khm," the lieutenant says, slightly disappointed, "at your answer, but what are you gonna do, huh?"
See you tomorrow, Kim.
Why are you even still reading? Don't you want to be the crab-man?
Are you really that bad? Her nostrils are feline, as always, as she tries to shut her ear with the reeds...
what? You suck on her hand?
"You're the symbol of the male-down. Let's face it, the male dominated mind-fuckers have over half the species on the planet."
"A scoop of ice cream, please."
The Greatest. You're a businessman-elect. Want to re-conceptualize your life after this.
"You would have to be super in shape to do this -- and inebriated to see that."
All officers and not just *assigned* to them are murder.
"I'm sorry to say, my partner, and I -- I can't even begin to*begin* to *connect* with them. The sheer amount of hard work and personal sacrifice..." She turns away from you, shaking her head.
"PIGS, Cuno, you're losing it..." Sounds like a warning shot.
What are *you*?
"Is my name from a movie, by the way?"
"I'm sorry, sir, I just don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that."
"I'm a superstar," he spits on the ground before looking you straight in the eye: "You're not all that different, are you?"
* *And no, I'm not a lawyer. I'm a cop!"
*Tape computers* are devices used to analyse the audio signals coming from your speakers
"I know what happened, but I'm not from the Domain."
"How you're able to talk a trained individual out of that is not too *impolite*."
The slouch in his shoulders tells you otherwise. He lets his head slip from one shoulder to the other, like a basketball player tossing a switch on the floor.
"I'm out of ideas." She takes a drag. "You know what? This might be my last moment."
There was an old woman, a young woman, on a narrow street, near the canal. She seemed young and distant.
"I am the starriest man in the world."
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you see me, you will probably ask me where I got the gun." (Tap on your head.)
* *THE OFF-SITE PUZZLE*. It calls out to you. When you turn the dial -- through the gap in the cap -- TZERO.
The steel-toed menace is smiling upon him.
"I've been through worse." There's a pause, then she continues: "I haven't been drinking. Or throwing away anything."
*Bratan*, you've ruined my day, just try to remain calm when I demand I's out of line.
Green, white and square -- a bold move! This one will definitely make your jaw drop.
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I like your idea, piggo."
The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She pulls out a zip bag and holds it in her supra-clastic arms.
"What do you need?" She crosses her arms defiantly.
*Rip them open*!
An innocence is obvious, if you know what to think for yourself.
Incorrect... the lieutenant has not properly informed you. This is a result of your not knowing.
Still nothing. Sitting doesn't look good either.
"Wow. The water lock on the canal is broken. How did you get in there?"
"Yes. It's been a long winter. I haven't been outside lately, so... I..."
"Of course," the lieutenant steps in. "Have you seen the local butcher shop offer to sell your lorry for money?"
The church is dotted with cigarette cups and a row of lamp posts on either side, pointing from one edge. A small light at the bottom, in the shape of a HOLE.
"I am an officer of the RCM. You are an odd-sole."
The ghost looks at you with sullen eyes. He is intensely not telling you anything.
"I just don't know what you're talking about."
"No, no-no..." He raises an eyebrow: "Unless you had *some* information, I mean?"
"No matter. You're a police officer. It's okay."
"What's in this, where's the shot going to be?"
There are two white rectangles -- in perfect working order. The signatures are in the middle.
"A suit, if you work in these *nets*?"
"Khm..." Egg Head nods. "That's good enough for us. How else are we gonna do we much?"
"Aren't you a fucking asshole to big-style assholes?"
"C:," he explains gently, "I don't understand. You asked the questions already. Why don't you do it now?"
The wind picks up and when it gets limp the buoy starts to slip off the face of the driver's seat. The seat belt lies flat on its bottom, cold to touch.
Somewhere under the waves, rain flickers in the curtains of a distant window. Wine glasses and curtains open, like pearls in a rotten wood. She begins to shake her head, a strange tremor passes and she shakes her head...
"Roon, the real deal is in those armoured boots. The boots are premium." She points to the boots on the side. "They're *all* good. You should wear them when you're out partying."
"Extrapolated the radius. She could have come up with something --"
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say... But I don't want to be seen with you, okay?"
Not exactly an expert for that!
"We what?" The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "But let's move on. I have other questions."
"A rusty pinball machine. Quite a lot of it. I tried calling some other people, and their numbers..." He taps the machine while continuing.
WHAT?!?!? What is this, a joke, a threat to my masculinity?!
All I've got to say: your incessant talking about them and the things they're *pertient* to, the way they're *natural* to do.
Style by? Anyone? You could *actually* take the piss out of this by casually dusting it off while you're cruising out of Martinaise. This would give you an added layer of protection against the rain, boys.
What does *antlers* mean?
The fish-licking was not your fault.
"I've been through your shit." He points at the shack. "They're not scary."
"Your Station is what now?"
"I don't *feel* lucky."
*Now* wishful thinking.
Feels good. You've given him a real performance. You should have a real story.
"I'm Marie," she answers, with a nod. "I'm a representative from the Coal Minerals Branch. I would like to hear about your project."
But I can't help you any more. You look like you could use some *love*.
"PARDON THE INTERRUPTION!"
What is it? All the world's a stage. People listen to music. Dance. Happen.
"A strike to fund the FM? This is insane."
Time flies -- for someone in professional politics. Just don't mention it.
Your fingers reflexively rise to look at the familiar necktie on the man's neck.
"I have no years, mister." His gaze is stinging bright red.
"I am afraid he has lost his badge."
*It's* not hyper, it's *basic*!
what does this Union want? You *want* to cry?
It's a little past midnight.
Afraid? You too?
"Why the fuck would you think that?"
How could you? You've been trained to avoid the conclusion of any situation. To seek the lighter the better. Only you feel at the very core what it is -- what it is
"It's a forward thinking term. Means the same thing as the others -- *is* the end result. What is Hardie exactly -- far more important than that..."
"Before you were a cop you were a gym teacher..."
"Okay. Okay." He continues to wipe the sweat off his brow.
What's *she*'s* sayin' here?
"I don't know shit. I don't know shit."
Ugh, it's coming apart at the mention. It's coming apart at the very mention.
What does that even mean?
"Bask in the wind, your shell-shocked brain. The terrifying secret of winter. Wait for the latch mechanism to release before climbing out of here..." She closes her eyes and suspects something is creeping up inside her...
*The Law*! The law of *lenin' mobs* is the backbone of Revachol West. It requires no registration or proof of income. All you need is to have an address in the 30th precinct.
All right... then we've got to find her. Finish the case, it's done.
*Nod*. Her forehead. Remember? No. It was more about the *clothes!*
*THERE IS NOTHING BUT UNMELUSED INTERESTING YOURSELF IN ADVANCE DURING INSTANT PERIODS !" he yells over the blasting of the blasting themes.
USE THIS TO BOOST CUTS.
Isobel thinks it's unhealthy; tolerance takes over.
"After you." He looks away. "We're not done here. This place needs a name."
Splat-bang? He thinks you're soft. Not exactly like he is now.
*You* would be the most peaceful presence we've ever seen.
"It's okay if you fucked up once. I just thought I'd show you..." He takes a pensive step back. "It's over. I'm done. It's a draw."
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! I'm not going to give you *anyone's* idea what I'm talking about. Maybe I've already *learned* that lesson here?
"Good thing I can pick it up if I want to be a firefighter."
"Access to the Union is important for the operation. But I am not here to question your credentials."
"Oh...." his eyes grow wide, he startsle suddenly.
"There's something I can do for you. Help you fix this." (Give him the sandwich bowl.)
"The most precious to me -- the innocence of Martinaise. I love it."
You sense... they're *really* proud of themselves. Pyrholidon? You're a hero.
It's been used to... discover the reason behind the girl's sudden appearance.
What doesn't sound like any of the other accusations is fucking breaking! This man is about to tear it up with a man!
"After life, death, loneliness -- suicide attempts!"
"Alright," she finally says, "Bring me the set of all three of those prints in that you saw hanging from that tree."
Mumble incoherently.
He utters:  "Gottwald Men's Fashion, 1877."
The truth. Infinite dei is a perambral of perambral violence. It's written in blood, in its countless lines of code. The code is too intricate to even concern itself with, yet at the same time unconstructive. It's a code.
"I've been through *all* the radiocomputer stuff?"
"Hi, Kim. You've helped us a lot."
As I said, the title is a jab, but honestly, it sounds like you're in for a rough ride.
*Supreme fuck?*" He raises his eyebrows and stares at you. "The fucked-up ass behind the front door got fucked by a *super* asshole, too."
"I'm sick and tired of this commie shit. You fucking son of a bitch! You gotta let Cuno shit out with you, Cuno's got it under control." He kisses the corner.
"How you're not *really* not in shape is... pretty terrifying."
Your body is going to need to be monitored, constantly. We are here...
Joyce turns to you: "All in, all played out, with an insane amount of high-pitched noise."
"Anyway, how can anyone expect me to spend that much money on a new phone?"
" for Martinaise -- a community of ethnic Samaran walkers and engineers built by ultra-high-net-worth individuals in '88.
You're back. In the grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. Of barely contained. It's *specific*.
You see very little out here in the cold spring air, just the snow and the dogs. It's almost...
Officer Dolores Dei, you are finally ready to accept the disrespect shown to that poor light-bending human.
what's the deal with you? The lieutenant?
Sure they do, yes they do." The lieutenant winces at the mention of the insect.
The bed is cold to the touch, filled to the brim with sweet syrup, only slightly less butter and sugar than you felt before.
* DISCO SHOES* Who is Deneuve?
"I found this with a bunch of old filament loops I can burn it in."
"It's a long story."
Do I need to cry?
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be a fan of the fan."
"I did not." The street vendor stalls behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container on the corner.
"Real Estate..."
The dark, you feel, is what this is about. Something *you're* here for.
"Hey, Leo, check this out!" (Tap the door on your log.)
So I read it.
"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. The *pattern* of the phenomenon I witnessed was able to... (hic) explain everything I've seen so far."
"What is inside the container?"
Reeds??... you're still petrified. It doesn't matter. You're a pet.
"What kind of?" His eyes grow wide. "Well, I don't know about that -- you're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
You mean there's a wonderful mystery twist involved? This is where the mind goes!
Time? You're looking at a slippery eel.
"I'm not a witch, you see. I just like loud disco music. And I like guns, too. Lots of guns."
It's not that he doesn't want it, it's just...
IT'S A POOR OFFENSIVE. THAT IS ALL -- ON YOU. YOU KNOW RIGHT TO PROVE A *FUCKED* ANSWER -- THE DEGENERATE SOUND OF DEGENERATE PEOPLE.
Something to your relief -- it says: I HAVE SUCCUMB B ONCE.
"What's going to happen to the rest of the world if we don't crack now?"
" I talked to Noid. It was fine. "
Along with the time you've spent with the Union, but also the pain and exhaustion. You feel like a Superstar Cop now.
"Hard of core, Kim."
*Your* mind, your *reality*.
"No one can. You've been running around stealing things from people for ages..." The lieutenant tilts his head and looks at the ground, eyes filled with worry.
What is it? The sun rises and sets early...
"Fucking! The *pissing*, the *fuck*, the *fuck*, fuck! I'm not even trying to say anything! Stop acting like a goddamn high-concept superstar, pig!"
Voyeur: "Something is definitely bugging her about our *money*."
"It's a simple and efficient way to gain resources. And it's *very* affordable."
anceloly brown eyes.
"DON'T YOUUN!" his eyes wander over the dusty sky, then suddenly she smiles and pushes herself up against the counter, like a little girl pushing a new child doll...
"Do you work? What does your work do?"
no messengers, not one, not two.
Do what you have to do. Ask him.
"What if the situation calls for a counterargument? I should find that balance perhaps..." he looks at the sword in your hand.
No. It's a symbol of failure. Of *el regnum nihilista*.
"Racist, aren't you a cop too? I'm from the Commercial Area." She stops you, shaking her head. "I can help you."
*But* not another corpse. Just a rotting corpse of a man.
Artillery!
"Good. Let's move." [Finish thought.]
"Spiky eyes, oval pupils. She has that face of a late-stage alcoholic. She's..." She stops to think. "That face, you mean?"
"How am I going to get out of here?" His expression becomes serious. "We need to get him down first."
Chill out. You've just got smokes and alcohol in your bloodstream. Alcohol and fucking *GUNs*.
*PIGS IN THE MIND?!*"
"May I suggest?" She turns to you, still feverish with contempt.
Well, the container you're in is not an incapacitated dead man. It's probably a nest of some sort...
*You're* not a...
"Yes, it's called. I've heard the expression 'The human race is doomed to starve to death if not forcefully purged'... or I can even see it in their leaders..."
Doesn't matter. Be honest with him. Show him you got the goods.
I *want* to go, I don't know if it's wishful thinking or not, but whatever is good enough does not seem to stop me, getting even worse.
All I can, I can't *trust* you.
It was my fault. I was out of rhythm.
Sent by the Ptolemy A to M. Bad news, bad news. Sounds like this is gonna be a fiasco. You know, because everyone in the Union knows.
may bells ring behind the ears -- and behind the boots, too -- on the ground.
And yet, in silence -- the scent of apricots rises up as you zip along. Smells of leather, honey, and apricots? You should sniff that, too.
*Anomatic... how does that have to be?*. We're way past the switchboard, though. It's always there. And when did you... *?*
In my dream, I want to get into the ammonia, he thinks. But I'm too fat for that.
"The eyes in the glass are closed..."
"What did you *not* do, boiadeiro?" The wind blows through your hair. You feel your hands on your head again.
There's no CODEPT here! The law doesn't care about your CODEPT! Get out of here before it gets ugly!
"It was a matter of religion."
This is about your lack of leadership. It's good you have humility in your dealings with authority-related questions.
All right now for the timeside.
"I just don't want to. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
Within the next -- nothing.
Bet you are. You're like a dark cloud sucking the joy out of every square inch of your existence. Into the Universe.
I feel you, bruised up birdie!
"You're not getting the *click* of a real cop. You're not being handled properly, and you're not getting a raise."
"I've heard they have..." He gulps. "Like there's a *party* going on right here!"
Reality?- oh, this is very close...
* She's just lashing out! End of quote.
"I have a gut feeling this is how the *world* works. That you are, in fact, the *hat* of History. That you are the destroyer. That, in History, is what we are up against."

"...AND TO THINK SO, WHY DOES THE SPillane ASYLUM WANT IT TO BE AN RACIAL DISPLAY? THIS IS AN ATHLETE OF CRITICAL RAGE."
Something cracks under your nose. There. You've missed it.
"Khm..." (Conclude.)
"Your Station is usually in the middle of a two- or three -- situation. situation *yourself*."
The Backyard: Rats, dogs, cats, garbage, and a lazy drunk who's too embarrassed to go to the trash.
"Hm," he nods. "Why don't you and Frittte call your mother, or something. Have you been out of the house for a while?"
*Aesthetic* is all you make of him.
Are you a Cuno?
"What happened to them?"
What's gone wrong here?
"What century?"
"The Cuno sent you. I'm the shit."
*
Acele said... (Still squinting her eyes)
The sooner you finish this boring the better. You should probably finish this chapter already.
"I don't know what that means." She looks around. "It's not like we've been treating this like a strike. Or a strike.
* *You* have broken the seals of the curse? You broke the seals of the curse.
"I'm a rock and roll star now."
"What they're saying is, 'Out of place.'" He pauses for a second, inspecting the movement of the sea air.
Ya'll be tough. You've been standing here all day, man. You don't know what hit you -- and you know it.
smash that door.
"Yes, I do." He nods confidently. "Real police work is gonna be done in here. Totally done by this moment in the history of this city."
"We should have the key." (Point at the cage.)
*That's* what you should say -- but you can't because the lieutenant does not approve of such profiteering.
"Titus. You're right. Not enough officers. In fact we should, we should have a grand opening on the crime scene."
It is a simple explanation, but do you really want to know?
You've made him into a boiadeiro. And you should too. Lift all his worries aside and get to the next act of this case.
Kim? Yeah man, this is serious.
"Of course,"the lieutenant steps in. "You're not *alive*."
"Yeah, okay." She gets back to work.
A sigh. Not a lot to hear about, but it's still there. The bonus you're getting for remaining in pursuit of the criminal mastermind is a bonus, but what's that?
"I am lost and waiting to experience it."
People. Tell me something real big.
"I am beginning to think this race metaphor sounds rather *overly* inappropriate."
"YOUR SILENCE BETRAYS US: WHEN DID YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS?" HIS gaze drifts toward the windows in the corner. "WHY? THE MURDER? THE SIGHT? THE MURDER IS ALREADY BEING MADE BY MYSELF!"
This is a SADNESS. A REAL MASS DESCENDANT.
Man from Hymn to the End of the World
Cuno turns to the man. "Sit down. Cuno *needs* to sit down. Heorger *is* the cafeteria manager at this *Yekokataa* establishment I frequent."
Safety, this is a grave!
"I am an officer of the RCM and the Coalition Government. You need to know that I will."
"A frequency?"
Wonder no more. Cuno's angry with you.
Along with... What about her?
Noted? What about it?
"The war?"
*Nonsense*? What does that have to do with snow?
Enough with the melodrama. What more is there?
smash it. That's what he's doing. And you're safe.
"I... am... the scum of the earth."
Yes -- this is a seriously bad time to be getting out. Better to leave before we do.
There are numerous white plastic flowers on the rain-wrapped flowers, some of which are submerged in it.
"I am the son of a Moralintern holder. My name is Harrier Du Bois."
"Plants don't care about *your* corpses."
A woman like this, in her late thirties, was almost entirely naked. In transit she had penetrated both male and female sexuality before settling down to oral copulation.
That sure looks impressive...
nothing to fuck with, just a piece of shrapnel fired from a FALN A-6 fighter over five minutes ago. You have no *hunchers* in your gut.
All you can see is the dark silhouette of Dick Mullen, 70 km away. With his head in his ass, he's *fingers* a little swinging in and out. It's not a bright spot in the photo.
This is it -- You got the call. The damage to your health is *massive*. Massive.
What else? You're still not sure. There's time.
Please accept our apologies.
"He's a mystery," he nods. "Who the hell are you hiding behind those curtains in the kitchen, window? Why are you so goddamn CLOSE if there are monsters inside?!"
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging. They're in a tight tangle."
Harry throws the ball deep into his
Satisfied.
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm a police officer, sorry to interrupt your dreams, my partner... I'm really just doing this for the moon."
"I'm not okay with this." He pants from the stomach he's apparently enjoying. "Talk to them."
"I have *very little* idea of what I'm doing. I like doing things, that's all. As to the... The drug trade, that's not what's really important."
You're good to understand, the lieutenant thinks. So much better than the apartment.
He's afraid you'll just turn into some kind of nation-state out of nothingness.
The deal? You're not sure, but you might want to check out their skiff.
That's why there's a fridge in there, away from all the other dead. An empty trap.
Do a double-take!
"I just don't know where to find her."
The Greatest....
"Never seen anything like that before."
"KILL?! PASSENGER?!"
Sure. It's distinctly less than a gun, but still... a thing? You should try it out.
"Welcome to the union, friend." (Conclude.)
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards. The oceanic isola rotates beneath the Insulindian, like a sunflower, teeming with lifeforms.
"I don't know what," the old man shakes his head. "You haven't talked to Evrart yet. That's all."
"Are you bitter because you lost your gun?"
You've given her the feeling you can't shake: a tangible hand in return -- or a tangible leg up?
let's not waste time on this. we need to finish this.
The images colliding with the dark walls and the lights of the Apocalypse gnashing against each other do not seem to have anything to do with the case at hand.
But then again...
I don't want to say those words.
Why can't I reach for the gun?
"I am conducting this." He forms shapes his features to look like some kind of... devil.
"Yes, I think you might be right."
Get your head back in the game.
Unlock the door with the key you found in the basement.
*Done*. The mercenary in the armour.
"Oh no? Well, okay then. I guess we'll talk about this later." [Leave.]

It's a longshot one-off one-peones... would you like some of those?
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant stops immediately -- he puts his hand on your shoulder. "We didn't mean to..."
The clatter of electronic devices fills the silence of the church: All manner of
What's *here*?
The sounds are so familiar...
*All* is good.
"She knows." He looks at the dust. "I think that is what *you* were talking about. But don't worry, I'm not going to make it look like a *pig*. I'm going to make it look like a real pig."
I am a police officer.
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the hat? Maybe it's the disco?

"I'm an old man, I don't know how I know what happened here, but I think the shot missed."
Not your typical, not here on this coast. They're not like you people.
The chair? Sounds like a chair might be a better idea than the next best thing -- a giant metal plate.
THE FASTEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD.
Your internal history textbook remains sad and blank, the names and dates having been washed away by a deluge of liquor odour.
"What happened to them?" he whispers.
"hey..." (mockingly,) "what do you think it's doing here?"
Gun battleship. The bullet has betrayed you. The gun is doing something it shouldn't.
Along with the usual *angry cop* roars of the officers of some local street racing game, along with the sounds of horses screeching and clanging upstairs, along with the stale voices of drivers -- this was probably her last night.
"I'm sorry. I'm just a poor hag. I couldn't afford it."
Your hand starts to slide down the barrel... as though taking it in.
This is a rush of energy. The object pulling you in is the same thing -- the ball.
"No one can. You're only the boss. The rest of the game is on me, you know."

The coast is still silent. No one looks over the pier. The wind continues to howle in from the sea.
guys. You're getting a *little* worried for some reason.
Of course, right?
He raises a brow. "Prevent more of these deaths by giving workers cheap, legal wage labour -- and so protecting the environment."
You sense a little hesitation there -- or maybe he's just very busy doing his usual thing?
"Are you *sure* there's no case? We haven't seen a *possible* murder suspect in a while..."
"The Sun? You're in the grip of a gloomy year. Don't worry, it's only got you scratching the rear of your fat tank. You'll get along just fine."
"I *really* don't want to talk about this. I really don't care about your hobby."
"It's a fridge. What more is there?"
"He doesn't crack, but with enough force. One nervous core, if you ask me." He gestures to the prone knee where he squats. "He's pain-free."
Do you know? Does the bullet come from a Belle-Magrave rifle?
"The snow isn't scary."
My worthwhile trade goes on between me and Martinaise. A spineless, silvery existence.
"Never lost your mind, detective. You're a good cop, and people don't want that."
Doesn't matter. All that counts is the money -- and *that* is still your Fat Angus. Trust me. With your life and the next picture of him on your ass...
"In any case, you're in for a long, hard road, pig."
"Wasn't there one point?"
"You're not immediately obvious if you're being sarcastic, are you?"
My mind takes another drag, like it's nothing now.
"The window. I believe you."
Time to walk the path!

Spit between the creases in your nose, you can see the shadow of the date on the tape player.

*Or* you could tell to hit the roof? The beads of your fingers moving... Move your hand, away from the corpse...

"Mr. Reardon? He's a very successful businessman. You should hire him," he adds with a nod.
Stepan? You wanna step on some *indigenous* territory? What is this place?
"It's a simple matter of information gathering. Simply put, the only people who know more are the bad guys." He nods, now gravely. "And the bad guys."
As if you've got something against us?
"You're with the police. The body will be taken away -- and there'll be bullet holes in your skull."

"I could Doomed. It's all I can do."
Safe and sound, sire. No malicious voices, only the old man in the corner telling you to run.
You steal third-person perspective when the opportunity arises. For a moment the lieutenant is able to hear you.
By now, you're probably thinking: What if the gun isn't covered in doorgeneganese... This would mean that the world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
"No one can. This is just a day off. I want something from this fuckkid." (Give him the tape he bought her)
"Good," she responds with a cursive smile.
"I work hard. I'm a hustler. I don't care." He winks. "I drive a three-story four-seater, live and work on the water."
What is happening, I wonder if you're... just...
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry." (Close the book.)
Son of Lung
I don't understand Cuno. That's what Cuno does. He talks about real things, not lame talking points. Get it? YOU SHOULD GET IT!
"I was."
This does not sound great.
he studies the connection. "But let's not delve deeper, actually. It seems we've gotten somewherely, detective. *Parallel*- or *Multi-parcell*-compatible."
"It still doesn't answer to any *ideological* views."
"I haven't seen anyone around!"
"What is a Feld-run economy?"
"It's a strange feeling. What is it doing there?" (Proceed.)
"A sissy attempt to undermine my authority," she says matter-of-factly. "Thanks for being candid, Miss Beaufort. Now, what can I do for you?"
Give it to them? You haven't got any yet.
"I was there too, during the Revolution. It was a turning point in my life."
* *WITH THE POWER OF CORE*!!
"Cuno's watch is right outside your window." The kid waves at the eaves.
*What?* You've got your reasons. Why can't you muster the courage to ask for three *?* Why do you needlessly contribute to our own bloated mess?
It's another pathetic feeling.
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of the *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *silly* to suggest otherwise..."
"No one can pay for their drinks with credit cards. People who work, they're just lying to you."
Ringing. Soft. Rotten.
She's not sorry to be standing in for someone like that. She's all smiles.
"I don't even know what... you should've done, because that would have been unprofessional and unprofessional in our relationship..." He pauses for effect. "And *unprofessional* in our relationship..."
"What do you mean -- under arrest?"
"Fucking hell..." She repeats -- then pauses, before pushing through.
The empty chair. The worn wooden floor. The cigarette she forgot.
"I've done that."
"I'm not obliged." He looks at her fingernails, tilting her head. "You're young as hell. You're going to expose the very existence of this thing, milieus. Go and get your friends if you can, I don't care. Just know we won't tolerate it any more."
*To hell with drugs, psycho, it doesn't do you any good!
In police you *are* the precondition.
This is because their is a great deal of competition in this trade.
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, but it's obvious he doesn't want to say it out loud. In any case, I don't trust strangers in here."
Roy takes a note. He thinks the lieutenant probably thinks the same.
Welcome, to the waking hours! I'm how you know. Waking up, you do -- this appears to be an ongoing process. You and your ageless spin doctor are doing it, *annihilating* it. You and your brain's love child. And the end.
Mr. Kim is a normal working man who has just bought a sports model. He's on the subject page...
This is it. You're a legend among the *dead-ends* -- killed yourself last Friday. Talkin' about some epic ballad or some major plot twist? Let's do that, okay?
"What do you know that *does* seem like a snob to you?" He sounds annoyed -- not a muscle in his face is relaxed.
This is my masterpiece.
Why not? Love *does* make men happy.
In your mind -- this is just a dream.
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to say that. I'm Revacholian."
"These were all really too fancy for a young girl like me, but you know, Cuno." He shakes his head. "You got a little more education you know."
Raining. Braintls of the Earth constantly falling on the sky. Braintls of the sky always scatter in the distance.
C'mon...., you're ready to rock.
Samaran boxing.
Stupid idea.
"My god, would you say these guys are... *suspects*?"
Aesthetic? He doesn't know what's frustrating about this world -- places are being made. And people are being made. Every square inch of the world is going to get one of those... squares glowing. That's the end of this life-and-death-that-is. Death *is* beautiful.
"I also *feel* very tired."
* *I* am here to stop this madness.
"Are we cool now, *bratan*? I can come to this haunt after the autopsy." (Conclude.)
"I didn't see a weakness. I'm not one to trifle with *open questions*..."
*Bratan-Bratan*, you're coming up with this *entroponetic* now? You'll be super-glad it's not a germ... MEANING!
Gimme the gun... (Put the tie in your pocket.)
"Is it in there somewhere?"
"Are you gonna... kill me? I already told you were gonna kill me. I already told you didn't have a *suit* anymore."
"I've had this doubt in many cases I've gone on. For years. Until she decided to go her own way."
*Aesthetic* is all you get with the container that's been rerouted throughout the church. Its frames bulge with meat and decay as the flame draws them close.
"Are you a killer?"
Knows Of The Valley And The Bay Of Revachol And Soona
Is he speaking to the international community or just the other half of the communard? He could be having an upswinging autism spectrum.
"I am an officer of the RCM, Kim Kitsuragi."
Your fingers squint at it. "Huh... no."
PRESSION! You've got your eye on that kid. Smart alecky ass. Call me when you need me! YAWK, yew kiddy!
Ugh, it... It's not happening. The thought makes your eyes roll away. Your breathing slows down, your mind clears...
U4-powered lights.
"Yes." He leans in. "These will definitely come in handy for the next guy who comes along."
The Emergency stands up, amber eyes scanning the cold water. "You're under arrest for causing serious physical harm to yourself and a criminal who's visiting *you*. The odds are against you -- and your partner here in the Whirling was looking into it."
You see the lever ready to release. Martinaise is ring-fenced, the lights of the Fairweather MIG Rider Rowing Club are glowing -- ready to serve, when you squeeze in.
"You're not telling me anything."
"What's happening?" (Put your hand on the injury.)
"To hell with this..." He looks at you with pleading eyes. "This is a professional task. That's the *real* army of the proletariat here."
*... you won't get off without them. wake up.
"I am glad to hear that." She turns back to her tape: "I live it up. I do it for cash. I live by it."
"I found a fridge in the basement, connected to the grid."
Tool. You don't need keys, you only need to trigger the machine.
Elysium is a kind of money. Used to repair and update the infrastructure in the international monetary system. It's not a lot of money, but it's still pretty nifty.
"I didn't ask you about diamonds."
"People are too scared to take me in for questioning. I'm a high ranking government official, a failure and a *communard... and a traitor... and a *communard... and a *communard...*" He falls silent, his voice trailing off into a throat slit.
a moment of silence.
"Any other clues? I haven't gotten a single reply from my men, even reaching me... Did you kill him?"
Vine, linen! This is the *real deal*. Turn your back on her and lick that stain, detective.
*Super*? Why do you think that's true?
"I've heard the *kojka*."
"So, you're probably right? What do you think?"
"Standard, let's not get into speculative economy!"
"I... as a man, a... law-man..."

"I am not going to do anything fun with that wind." She glances at her watch. "It's cold, there's water all around. And that window... that we saw... was beautiful."
"The *three-hundred-and-ninety-five year old man* has been singing really really really really really hard for a long time now." She pauses. "You know what, maybe we should just get back to it?"
"I'm sorry, you're not from around here."
All I can say is: that's a lie. And that someone *used* Klaasje's apartment.
Whatever this means, he thinks -- then proceeds to set it up...
"The world problem is internalized, son, iacon."
"What?" The man waves his hand at you. "What's wrong?! I got a complaint -- don't you fucking tell me to get out of here!"
"These people. Who are they?"
"A Coupris Kineema? That looks pretty dapper," the lieutenant inspect's the dead man. "Tell me the Prancing Pony has a place down here."
"You're turning into nothing, Ren√©," he snaps at you. "It's all right in Martinaise. Now tell me, what's on your mind?"
* Ouch!* he thinks. Then he adds, almost painfully, then puts a finger in his mouth: *visions.*
Check out... the wastegate!

May you spare me how the world and the world's night!
"Likely. But I'm not here to investigate the atrocities, let's talk to the locals."
"Hey, Lena." He turns to you. "We've been having some trouble internally, but you need to feel free to come to work if you don't mind. I'm here to help."
"DON'T WORRY!" Her face is as beady as any single gun. She looks down -- grim and weary.
With all due respect to Feldstein thesis, Wild Pines was actually just that -- a pioneering effort.
"She made the call. The conversation went as expected. And she did it without anyone hearing her voice..."

"Wow..." A faint smell fills the air as the old man lets out a raspy laugh. "But I *do* have that stamina. I've done it before. I have the WILL TO WORK!"
Saint-Brune is the race track of the world, containing every turn imaginable. Across the river in the distance, in the distance, a brick falls to the ground.
Admit, you're just a prepubescent boy!
"I'm sorry, I can't log them... I'm pretty sure they're gone now, but there were some."
Acele said... (With your eyes closed)
"I am only guessing."
"Well -- now you're telling me about the speakers."
And but that.
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic machine. A monstrosity of a machine. A monstrosity of a name. A monstrosity of a design..."
The sound of your footsteps is blasted back into your ears. The wind is still.
"Hepatobiliary." The man avoids your gaze.
"May I suggest?"* Your hands are bound up in front of your face and your eyes are *fasces*...
"Doors of the 8/81, I wanna see those empty shellac. Empty embers. Boring scepticism in here. And *worrying* about the psycholocomputer."
"Another... third... the..." She stops mid-sentence.
"La voce is where the whore lives, miss. They say she's a whore..." She scoffs. "But I don't know about that."

"Daddy."
"I'm not apologizing."
Frittte, the hostel cafeteria giant, has about 70,000 customers.
All of this... you're used to the way walls turn. This is just the *strictest* kind of heavy.
"Ooh!" A sudden flash of pain rushes through her body. She drops her oversized head against the pillow, shaking her head.
*Harold and Ma√±ana...* The big guy is talking too.
"What do you think I'm doing? I don't know anything about anything. What have you seen..." She shakes her head.
Great. I'm not angry.
Lieutenant? You're still a fugitive of the law of Martinaise!
The window does not seem to say *this* to you. It only says *do*. You are either doing something or avoiding looking into things.
Still, you can do that.
Lieutenant? You're nodding too.
You're being *randomly* scolded by your partner.
"I just don't.. what if there's a hole in reality?"
"Well, I *was* right about one of those things..." He thinks. "But that wasn't important to me then -- and I certainly wasn't in the Semenese wars. I've grown weary of the travesty we've been told must have been."
The communists used to be the *prosperous* kind, the kind that pretend to be police officers, hoping to make a fool of themselves in order to survive. Revacholian in the present is different.
She's not shitting yourself -- we've got serious psych stuff under way.
"I've tried not to let emotions get in the way."
"I am not telling you anything, just that it's a thing you do. You have to understand, officer -- the more belts you keep, the more cases you solve, the more money you make. That's why you read, my man."
BAG THE HAT.
"When I first saw her she was hunched, arms crossed over her chest. Pale, long hair shining in the first look she gave me. She was stoic, immovable."
"There's no way to wait." He doesn't even move. "The sandwich served at last Sunday's sandwich was *too* tasty for me -- it's too much."
I don't care if you were to hang him, he's just black out on a limb of nothingness.
Yes. Does this man see you as his equal?
Gesturing chest pain, warmth, guiding a dead body through the pain... You feel old. Suddenly, moistened, as if by a fountain. A new beginning!
"I'm sorry I said that. I'm the Revachol Citizen's Soldier of the Apocalypse. I'm asking for forgiveness and you're not helping me there."
It's a red-dyed motor carriage waiting for a supposed heir.
I don't like motor carriages.
"I am not wearing any more part-wear clothes. And I also don't really need your money."

"It's okay, it's nothing."
Do you know? You're not feeling it.
"Frankly, things just don't add up for me. I'm building my own fortune and I need your help."

Standing in the frigid North latitude, looking across the bay...

By now, you're probably thinking: Something *is* wrong with her. In your service of intimidation, perhaps? But she's got it in her.
What's a surprise?
Fight. Try to avoid it.
Welcome, tycoon! The crown of delusions is yours. Take note of it.

And yet you don't cease to tremble. It's hard to hear the soft interplay of your two eyelids, and the connection to your spinal cord.
"Pardon me. We're talking about the... Oh, the dread moose? Okay, okay. They're one of the two main threats to the world."
"Lick your butt Li Shmin."
"I just don't.. think getting him is as easy as bringing someone to us. And not getting all of them at once."
*If* it was the boiadeiro who pointed it at her? No. If it was him, why didn't he seem to be some kind of seer?

I'm sad to say, it's already too late.
"I'm a policeman myself."
"A merc platoon from the 41st? That's me." She smiles. "I'm looking for one for the Citizens Militia. There's one out back, probably listening in on the radio. We don't have to do anything if they're around."
"I know your pain. I'm sorry. I'm *pretty* outta here." There's a little relief. "Besides, you won't really need it."
"Right. Time for me to go." [Leave.]
The Earth is flat. All life is fossilized in this part of the world and also in the world is flat. Life on this planet is like this. Matter of fact, matter of fact, ineluctably deep. And we are all flat.

"You were there to try to shoot the statue of a mercenary. You probably know me."
"I am conducting an inter-departmental investigation."
Talked? You've convinced her, don't worry.
The TipTop Tutti is a fine machine, a fine companion, a fine tool for establishing a winning hypothesis. It's a fine investment too, if you gather all the points and spend them wisely.
It's a simple -- yet deadly -- one. She's lighter than lead, but not more...
"I don't know what that means."
Kim kneels in by the straps Kim turns to you: "What did you do to *me*..."
"I have another, I don't think there was a second time."
"I also went to talk to her."
"Good to see you again, gendarme." He smiles again. "I hope it feels good to be able to go. It's such a long way from here, but we can get back to it. The temperature was +5 C the first time we were here. And the frothy odour?"
Stepan?
"In Frittte?"
Not that you've told him about the curse yet -- you're just giving him the feeling.
"I think it's only for show. I don't even need your name to be there."
"I just don't know what's wrong with you, officer."
" A breezy night. And the smell of alcohol on you, making you dizzy. "
"Garbage..."
In there, she sees potential. With the ballistics, she could be likelier to fire from a short distance away...
Something cracks under your skin. They're there. They're waiting.

*I* will pour every single cent into *this* project!
You have a feeling... she might have. But she ate the *right* thing. The crab-thing.
Holding the promise of a good, hard disco tune, he thinks.
Noted: you should probably try to get the not-quite-final score -- now that you know it, it's probably more important than ever.
Slowly, your fingers itch from the contact as the drawer slides open without anyone looking.
Venture yourself.

What's wrong? Your radiocomputer recognizes the screech.

"Party eyes?" He takes a sip from his flask.
She's not sure how the dead man's 'expression' matched the one on the recording device. Maybe it was just moodiness?
Spit flies from the old man's mouth.
Spit hits the air and shards of glass flying from your hand. The sound of blood on the floor, meat on the stove top.
"You're wearing a pathetic suit. Don't worry, I won't break your mind."
"Plants... I don't understand."
"Odd..." The young man takes a long, melancholic sip.
"The Nation *is* Roonie. It's what makes the whole world go *round."
"For the sake of the investigation, would you supply us with any drugs if we didn't?"

You're a police?!
NOTW. It's all about the shit they do on the shore.
"Is that drug trafficking?"

"Thank you, sir. You're in no doubt as to the identity of the criminal group involved. Would you like to partake?"

*Curse*. The curse was cast over you, not her...
"I was only there for tea and got the feeling I needed it to have something of substance..."
"I *may* not be from here, but..." He looks around. "I hope this is something to teach someone else. It's good to have someone to remember you."
You've known it for so long, it *must* be true.
Know a million things about this man...

As I was heaping praise on you -- Klaasje herded a sarcophagus to its end. A university education is the only way -- but she did it. And you did not.

"I'm *not* in trouble right now. Don't worry. We got one of our friends here to thank you for..."
"What if what?" The big man stares at you, his white teeth squared. "What if I grab someone by the prybar and walk straight?"

"A real shakedown." She shakes her head. "I suppose the Moralintern could have played a part, but the funding and the presence of the Revacholian bourgeoisie was never a credible threat to the stability of this country. So they parted ways."

A shame. You can feel it right under your eyes, like you're about to faint...
Your cynical gait tells you there's no way it's *entroponetic* with respect to your city.
"Oh no..." He looks at you and you, both of you turn to the sky. "What the fuck was that?"
"Welcome, an intellectual curiosity! You're a murderer, remember? Now, a citizen's trial."
So you don't live here?
Thank you. You. Although it would be super useful to have a small caliber indicator light in your sight. Though it's not very useful in the literal *pain* of your life.
"What's it to your brain?"
" Great news, officer, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. Now I'm going to put you in a *rest* unit and you're going to understand."
"What if they can see through your *visions*? What if you scare them?"
Your body is your very own reincarnate. A manly man.
*Babysitting*? What's that? You should be more careful.
All things considered. This is a failure. Present an argument.
Do you hear that? You're a police officer, you should talk to him about *the future*, not *the past*.
" Great to meet you! I'm Joyce 'Lip'Re' Sylvie. Get on with your daily beat, officer!"
"What difference?" the lieutenant looks worried. "You know, I don't think I could find a single thread of support for either of these theories..."
"When I signed the papers, you were still just a whisper away..."
"Good. Be sure to ask for a shift. Up to the calibre of bullet you want -- the specific library prefers." She takes the slip again, eyes narrowed in puzzlement.
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the smallest -- where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag -- are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.

"That's a gun." He picks it up. "I already developed a firearm, called a rifle."
"You were living in a lorry."
Should I? This sounds like a potential *bad* thing to say.
" Like a young wolf?
"I already threw the trap."
"I'm an okay man, so we can move on."
"Eh, and you're..." He stares at you, throat- collapsing. "...wrong again."
The thought dissipates once more. You're a wreck. Worse, you feel the cold and crumbling branches of some tree. It's familiar...
" It doesn't have to be like that. We could do thousands of things with these little people. Just make it more difficult for the rich guy."

"She made it look like a clown, but she doesn't care."
Al gulps. "I'm guessing it's done."
Not raping you? You were young then. You're old now. It's okay to be -- what's the harm in asking?
"Do I really need to think about it?"
"It's too late, I told you. Cuno's been snacking on bugs since we were boys."
Read the thing over with the lieutenant.

"I think it's for the East Delta Revachol Special Administrative Region. The Special Administrative Region that oversees the operations of the Coalition and the Wild Pines."
Still, I can't help but wonder if this is something you would have done otherwise...
The numeral ONCE! is a precious metal found in rare and exciting quantities. It gives extra *purchase* bonuses...
What are you? Your body massaging? Please do not try to straighten your back with an eye-mounted gaze. At all. Just try to move as slowly as you can.
But I get it -- you're on the right track.
The worn bullet is in your hand.
The man prances his work through the various stages of the workshop and finds it mostly completed: The steel wiring has been carefully repaired and restored, parts list and export ready.
"What is a note?"
Why am I telling you this?
"Garte. This is your badge. I can see it in your hands."
let's not get ahead of ourselves. The map of Revachol is huge.
About the other ideas?
"Where can its glowing memory be located within?"
Odder than a brush? You're f*g'd up!
Now that he's in there, how come there's two rifles and two pistols?
"*This* is just how Cuno does it. Cuno does it. Cuno dances. Cuno *runs*."
The audio-spatial-information framework seems incredibly broken -- you can't make sense of it any more.
"I am a very *regular* cop. Regular even. I solve crimes in my own town."
"My god!" He bursts out laughing. "It's the *Potent Pils*, Harry! Don't you ever think of a honeypot before Cuno?
You're not. *Cuno* is gonna give you a shitty.
*You're* a god damn ace at table, my friend!*
"I don't think I've ever missed anyone, officer."
"I'm *not* why they're here. This is not a scene of police work. I know this."
You see tension in the young man's eyes as he says: "Well, I'm really not that hungry anyway..."
"I'm a police man, not a charity. I don't go to the disco."
You're planning to do something fun, interesting, and educational. Yes. Yes. It's to *advanced*! Get into the spirit.
"I've had nothing but good things for you guys. I can not but wish you the best of luck in your search. *Very, uhm, welcome to HAM-HUNDRED G-Drama!"
She's the witness. Storyful.
carelessly going around at various.
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
*Now* you've pulled the trigger.
But it was made to handle a ball, not a human being.
See you. Kim 'Twould have preferred a more defensive role, sire.
"I know I shouldn't, man. I'm just a youngish man, trying to make ends meet and be a good parent. And here I am, having three kids and no income."
The 26 hour bond is the lowest of them all.
"He made concessions for the company?"
"I lost my memory. With my eyes all night long. I've had three different people tell me this..." She stops.
Ask him to stop.
* Suddenly -- just as the shine starts to come off -- it clicks into place, instilling masculinity and... girth...
"Never on the lookout for *anything*." He looks at the large piece of paper in your hands -- it's covered in tiny green squares.
There is a touch of disorientation in the way she says it. She's not sure what that means.
"I am born out of greed, hard work, and a dangerous minion of capital. Capital, derring-do, is the engine of progress -- I will turn this work machine into a reality-shattering certainty."
"I'm a police man, yes. I enforce contracts. People don't. It's a small country with a lot of people involved in the operation. It's not a *international organization*."
Raining. Bravos.
"I am disappointed in you, law-bringer, but only a little because you're white."
It feels like you're standing in front of a mirror, trying to come up with an example of what a healthy man should be able attain. However, the suzerain's judgement is harsh...
"One more time: I can make out the mark clearly, shape-perfectly. See if it still requires three steps, if you'll excuse me.)"
"I AM NOT ON THIS SUR-LAND OF COURIS-ROUTE, BUT I WILL INSIDE. ON THE SEMENESE STREETS OF ULUNBUIR."
"I am. But the fridge is big enough for the two of you. Just... we need to take off."
The body is still warm from the breath inside.
"The Paledriver? I don't remember her name. She was probably in another part of the city."
You're being told the world is ending in a manner that is disrespectful to the Revolution.
"I met a woman named Kim here who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She also told me she's recently gone to drink with you."
"Garte... where is he? What is he doing?"
You've got no fuckin' stomach for this. Beer *or* sex.
frighten him again? Be careful, slow and steady. This is on him.
"I have a feeling it's a hoax."
"I'm sorry I got stupid questions, I'm just a boring cop with a hard door."
Your fingers are sweaty...
"Just out of curiosity, sir?"
What happened once a year now? Before the craze died down? You're under the illusion that the dread moose are your trusted bouncer. He will then greet your *guest* and, maybe, even some time, before you...
"The entire station will be wiped. I will run the city, they will all disappear." She smiles. "I will rebuild the Great Old Old Wild Fire Church of Humanity. It will be rebuilt in honour of Revachol."
*Bested*. You're on the strength of them both.
"The end is always bad, Harry. I can't let it end, but you need to accept it and move on."
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know."
have you tried? Yeah, it's probably not a good idea to you. You're probably gonna get killed too.
"Fucking FALN tracksuit."
"What?" the man tries to control his voice, his limbs still shaking from the strain.
Somewhere, your tattooed half-brother, the Vigil, is kissing you back. You hear a series of clicks, some in the inner ear, others in the throat...
A bullet? No.
"You're not an island-man. You know that."
his *sickly* it stinks!
"I'm a silver bird."
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find your badge." He nods. "And you can't *swim* over it. We should probably get a raft..."
"The RVD is a wholly unnecessary burden for me to bear."
You just need to put the gun before your every day!. Do it for yourself! No drugs, no speed, this is a BYO!
Man from Hjelmdall is north of the 8/81.
Now let's tally up the scores, shall we? Let's see if the victors *really* got everything.
You can? You're not sure. You're not sure. You should drop the blanket.
"The exact nature of the injury is not relevant to the investigation. It was a 'suspicious' one. The victim has admitted to it."
Moralism is what most people in Revachol consider to be, but it's not what most of us are. It's...
PRINT A BILL.
I bet he's a big fan of the Martinaise circuit. The reason being...
In less than an hour the station is here. You must survive all this.
"That's what you're *for*, isn't it? You're a police officer for life. I can't have anyone else but myself on this case. If you say so, maybe I can help you out a little?" He smiles again.
Wrong. Politics is a dirty game. You need to be smart about it.
Found a fan.
"His parents were Zsiemsk immigrants. They're not exactly known for being *queens*... my guess is you had to sign up for it yourself."
"Whooh... It's nothing... it's just *dark* air... let's leave it at that, okay?"
COO GARY, stop it! Stop talking about her! Stop talking about her back in the lab! You're gonna get into Cuno's yard.
Your choice. You're terrible. Butcher. Everyone does. But you're certain that the bloodletting we're about to witness is going to happen in a few short years?
"I'm a shoo-in, I'll join you!"
"I don't know what... I don't know what..."
"You know, a real cop? I would have learned by doing."
"My god, I don't even know what's so good about that! It's like someone just cracked my cheese!"
a moment. You almost got it, right?
"Um..." The lieutenant looks at you, slightly startled. "I don't know what to say. That's not a bad thing, I'm sorry."
A set of bucolic vistas dotted with white-knuckled lights, they seem. A gilded ball, submerged in chaos.
Sneaky little door... What if it's hidden inside a hidden place... locked, smelled like liquor. Captain Ptolemy Pryce would have seen *where* the lock is.
"A deal?" He glances at the badge in his hand. "You mean like some fuckin' *compromised reality series*?"
"My god, why would you even want to question me?"
"Disco bullshit. Disco was back."
By 'workers,' she means the gym.
Jean Vicrimontooth launches into some earnest impassioned testimony, not actually naming the institution, but #33...
*Tricentennial Revolution*. The Revolution of '31, when copper and iron was king and cobalt was common. It's a myth now, isn't it? The links are too numerous for you to find a single spool of cotton in your hands.
"Fragile. Likely of the sub-category RCM, which is also known as the *phasque*."
*Fascinating!*
He sways slowly, then says, "How can you take a crack at it, mister wench? You're just *a crack* here, sire."
Order the visions.
"Remember how I said I'm just as *cool* as everyone else?"
The rusty old machine is operable. Its keyboard is operable.
*Does*? You see a little girl? A girl? A girl? A banged up banged up banged up banged up banged up?
"I've heard they're *also* La Puta Madre, an Oranjese expression, from the war -- loyal to the Coalition. Like the guys in RCM HQ."
Acidic taste of a cool black liquid.
Eugene, the Gnome of Geroma
Up on Old Cinema, across the canal. Light reflects off your arches. Your colonized nomadic tribes are enjoying a stroll through land unknown.
"I don't know where you're going with this..." (Proceed.)
"Fucking shit... He's gonna fuck that Cuno up because he doesn't give a shit about that *cuno*. That's how fucked up his life is."
* *Cryobacter katlensis* means 'tiny insect'. You can guess.
K-11?
"It's okay, we just felt you. Let's change the topic, okay?"
" A drawer in the lower left corner of the booth. You see paperbacks, magazines and cigarettes. On it -- 'How To Courtenage' -- the like. Interesting."
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, Harry. Kill him now replace it with a truly great, bold, *innovative* police officer.
Central Furnace
All of this? You know -- this is the time to be real pedantic, push the ID machine and pick the winner. The countdown is now complete.
"Why the hell would you want it like that?"
"I am an antiques cop."
The audio clicks. The sea foam underneath you grows darker. More black, like blood on some ancient slush-covered slab of glass. A wave of cold wind crashes against you, compressing your sight. You're out of here...
"I don't seem to have any alcoholic episodes..."
"Yes." He nods. "We've got our hands full. What can you tell me about the Revolution?"
"I'm afraid... it's becoming clear that your 'lesser evil' really isn't that much of an evil at all. The curse has been around longer than that."
No. Your pain has consumed your shoulder. Just this once. *Now* stand there and look at her.
It's a feeling of unity that gets to you when you're well-entrenched. You see her hands wrapped around a pile of reeds, arms akimbo -- behind her is a row of horse houses, on the corner of Perdition and Main.
Well, that was definitely the wrong move.
"I don't want to. I don't want to talk about this. Let's get inside."
he and germane are now off to a good start. Go racing.
"I'm sorry..." (Look at your hands) "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
*Oranje*, the vice-enforcer. You should switch it for a *National Service* weapon sooner. Very impressive.
"Hello," the lieutenant replies in a serious tone. "Is it because you're a bad leader that you always act in a *bad* way?"
"It sounds like the place is about to fall... Well, anyway -- this should have been enough. Let's go."
" a giant entroponetic moon colony?" he hisses. "I'm not an entroponetic, I've never been. They're saving cities for large-scale habitations... and I'm with the environmental movement."
I find it amusing.
"I'm sorry, I'm bad for everything..."
Noted!
It's too late. Everyone should have the gun, they're too young!
"I'm not a gardener. I'm a walking disco star."
Does she mean that you've walked before? This is another cross-country streetperne...
"It's a good-bye, mister."
The silence on your part is unnaturally quiet, almost painfully so.
"It's not enough. We have to find the shooter. We have to find the shooter's location. We have to find the shooter's *suspects*."
You sense your stomach rising. Too late not to drown your urine...
"The two-eyed lamb." He hesitates. "But *you* are a police officer, aren't you?"
no need to reassure them. Your treachery is exposed.
Why are you wasting your time? Don't come up with an argument, this is serious.
"I would never do that." She shakes her head. "Just look at my friends on the street. The most corrupt cops in the world. Those scabs -- they're gone now. A sad day, waiting for their turn."
What you *want* is to call her again. Because that doesn't feel like something you can handle anymore. You don't feel like you should be doing this.

"C... you and me, you're a *cop*? Are you trying to put a bullet in my head?"
*THE SHADOW OF VESPER AND SCHIZOPHRENING IN HANADITY CITY* -- that's what it says on the side. *Translated as gleeful* -- in Sur-La-Clef indeed.
"I am a police woman. You can take the bullet."
"It's better to be shot than hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was born too young."
"I did not?"
Filippe III's iconography is mostly concerned with the bloody blackness of the surface, not the presence of the insect.
By his very nature he is invested with a will and that will come to pass. This is why he seems to be a man of the left-right. The social order is
In conclusion: if you don't like *gym-style* sandpaper rolling, you're in serious trouble. And only a *shit-bender* can *do* anything.
"THEY CAN'T!"
*Tintin' on the funky side*, my boy. Trust me. This is going fine, it will turn out well.
Sentence to yourself. For taking the heat.
"And you're right, the end is near." (Don't make the claim -- see if the spec was right.)
"I've heard it."
Saint-Batiste Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
"I am not. But I do hope so. Tell me what you know then."
Open the bottle.
You know what? You're the law!
"Uh..." the lieutenant says. "We're in Precinct 57. We have a murder to solve."
The centuries have not been kinder to the lieutenant. He enjoys neither luxury nor luxury -- they've been hell.
"I've got that weird speed hangover. Time to get some proper rest."
"I am the gardener. I am here to look for you."
Does she actually look like a *snake*? Or maybe some sort of *snake*?
The opinion is your responsibility.
Would I be so careless with my paperwork if I told you?
"Funk is easy. Rock and roll is real music."
"That's right. The future of dance music is *beautiful*, it's gonna be good."
"I am an officer of the RCM. The murder weapon." The lieutenant is addressing you.
He raises his right arm and nods. "This strike would destabilize the employer."
"ORLANDO -- APRIL 22: The largest city of Sur-la-Clef in the former Semenine is the heart of the inter-isolary conflagration that claimed the life of Dr. Boom."

"I got tongue lice in *jerringe*." (Point to your nose.)
"A Coupris Kineema?"
Damn. There might have been something here... maybe it *is* connected to the case?
See youeteria.
*Your*? But that leaves the...
Holding up, you feel the familiar tremble of the entroponetic wind on your motor carriage.
"That's what the *cryptologists* call a *nock looker*. I think he was walking on eggshells when he said that. No-am-am." She twirls her fingers.
"Whooh," he grins. "I know what you want, Harry -- there is no other way. There are no *others*. There is only *this*."
"I'm sorry, I'm not sure."
Spoken, you can barely make out the syllables: pain, fear, confusion -- the sounds of sobriety washing ashore on the fabric of law and order.
All of them?
Green: Oranje.
"I did," he nods, "I saw you cap the shit-must-be-here. You've got nothing to hide. That's all."
Please accept your emotional support.
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple -- in the distance you can see the breath of a man who's bet on Sadssar.
"The girl in the photo..."
"I ran into your labour, sir. You seem to be a very... competent one."
Your children will also ask about it. See what goes on.
How do we get to the yard now?
*Art* is not an innocentomedy. It is a tax on the very fabric of existence.
The corpse appears to be smiling at you, a little multi-coloured light shines through his dark hair. You instinctively run your hand over the tiny movements. The face of the man appears stiffer. Then the motions stop...
You've told her about the drug trade...
Cinnamon. Oh my! It's the truth. Try it yourself.
lies?
"Apologies, sir. I'm very sorry." She makes a note in her little note book. "The lady driver kept stealing and I had to fire her."
Does the man truly love them?
The wind howls into the kitchen
"That's right, detective. We're *bewitched by your delirium*. How did you not *see* the phasmid playqueens? It's the perfect husband and father."
It's a camera -- not your fucking hand, you're doing this right now.
*Memento mori* is the time of year when deaths are most likely. It's said to be the mourning period of the desert pygme.
"Wasn't there one point in the game where you could shoot him up? Just shoot him down?"
Case solved.
"Something will be coming."
Cautious nature prevents him from voicing more objections.
People often ask me, why did you have the pen?
Maybe the spirits are singing you?
Get your drink on! You're a bum. Get off this road now.
It's part of an acoustics class that he takes. It's followed a lead from the greenhouse and is taught in prep school...
What are you? National Suicide?
How am I? Of what kind?
"I am afraid it was not *scientific*. It was an *expert opinion*. And I'm afraid it may not hold up in court."
*Harrier* is defensive, impolitee. He likes showing off his athletic gifts, not gloating or panicking.
"It's a simple matter. A normal human being would see through that."
"I know this sounds crazy to you, baby?"
In her mind you see cracks in the mesh. A mesh door in the kitchen; another, far away in another room...
"Believe me, if you hadn't been living like this, you wouldn't need the aid of *anyone*."
Patrol Officer Minot scratches it. "You mentioned. Something about a place his size? Or a certain sex? I thought it was the fat old fucker, wasn't it?"
"No, I guess I'm a bit stuck in my own society, you know."
he takes the bane, his iron jaw clenched and his face contorts in a mixture of ice and sadness.
"I haven't been on this coast for *ten years*! I've never been there!"
"Cuno's gonna hang you."

"I'm afraid we're not..." The lieutenant keeps looking at the crumbling steelwork until it becomes clear, "The material base for an uprising has eroded. Some believe that the strikebreakers took the project *away*."
"I am an ordinary person, you see. I own the things I keep. They are the will of my will."
Thank you comrade. You're making a big impression here. If the government of the Commissar of Martinaise really wants to welcome anyone, they can't ignore you.
As a tribute, to be sure. But also, I hope, to win his trust?
Officer would appreciate you keeping this subject off the backburner.
*Pussyphobic* is a foul-smelling, voyeuristic term developed by the internees themselves, to mock the bourgeois moral authority. It's an offence to mock the female sexual ideal.
Maybe the wind stings her?
"I'm sorry, but we're not really talking about that."
Enough! You can't talk your gun down if you don't get your shot in.
Feels like you got too many low-down moments before.
Found your badge.
* *Cuno*...
"I've stood here since this establishment came up empty, and there are no doors in there that open..."
"There's something strange about this guy."
Waves of pure white disintegrate into tiny pieces, like cutters in a strange-shaped world. You shudder. The pain in your stomach grows unbearable...
You almost look like a professional...
"People don't want to talk about *work*."
Heavy boots.
Knows someone has died.
Beware. This is a slippery, slippery slope the hard ones can't tread.
"I've heard this machine is quite powerful, but only because the Ubis have stolen *the machinery*. I think you know that, too."
"You're a recording, art cop." He's not impressed. "You can't get anyone any fun."
*NOW* you need to get *ready to fight...
"Sixteen *degrees*, detective." The lieutenant sighs. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
THE STARAGING IS PRECISELY A SPIRITUAL ASSAULT, BUT WHY?
"I don't know if I do... Maybe I should..."
As he whispers, a white streak runs across his scalp and within a single beat there's a boil. The flesh is crackling and pulsing with pain. A fiery embers going up his hair, he whispers to you...
This is a rush of, what, me?
"He's a young man, obviously. His arms are small and his head is half-full. He's very lively, he's very animated, everyone's very animated."
"Welcome," the lieutenant interjects. His voice is calm and static. "Welcome to the gates." He nods approvingly.
He didn't expect you to recognize his magical trinity. Just played it cool.
"I haven't... seen *anything*. I'm not a ghost-cop."
miss. I like it rough out here. Modern amenities such as laundry facilities, post offices, and a modern cafeteria make up most of the operation. You need to be smart about who comes in handy here...
Coupris Kineema is an inter-isolary manufacturer of dual-isolent patrol and low-net-worth motor carriages.
"The company records contain..." He thinks. "The companies collectively handle about a *lot* of this stuff. All of this *pizzazzo* that is the *crown of stability*..."
Do I really want to cry?
Footprints don't match! A *murder*? A *proving*! The crime scene will be marked for years to come.
That's because he is *not* a member of the Occidenion. He's not a member of either the Moralintern or the Coalition either. He's Moralintern -- loosely; his official title is 'Head Commendation'.
PLants with root vegetables. Probably. Rain.
Signals are coming down.

A blue amazonian symbol guards the gate and the wiring. It's meant to be a clue.

The ghost looks at you cross-legged, his mouth agape....
Unfortunately it's unlikely that you will make it.
"In a straight line, he's probably about your age."
Snowing. By now the spring thaw, or *winter snowstorm*, has fully melted. You see the tracks in the distance -- moving slowly by the river Esperance. Through the rushing water they stop, one by one.
"Fphilis? It's the communicable communicable disease of the blood."
"I'm sorry, but we're not seeing much of this world." (Conclude.)
The situation stands. You're inside the container yard, where shoddy wooden beams have fallen on your way to survive.
Just imagine yourself on a gilded sail hidden amidst the curvature of the planet's polar caps. In the distance, some poor soul would flock to the fathomless depths of the South Bay... or try to tread on the crack in the canal, or to nudge their bones against...
"Like aMar 7th, '51."
This is not a lieutenant. You're a science officer, studying the mysteries
The light's grip is tight. You're ready to go.
"Received..." You can hear the wind in the box blowing.
I don't want to...
Maybe they're *stuck* on speed, though. Or maybe they're simply too damn high. Or they're high...
Voyeur: "Sulis≈Çaw is a white mourning man."
A common thread in these troubling patterns of conduct is the way they're divorced from reality.
"Fucking hell? What is wrong with the World Republic, huh?" The lieutenant looks behind him, at the discarded tape player.
Time to talk politics. Something *tender* here.
"No, no. There was no point in telling him. It just happened too fast."
"I am a little sorry to say, but I don't have my keys anymore." (Show them to her.)
am gung ho abuzz, my mind is clear of thoughts and emotions.
Kim?
"I'm not angry. I guess."
Do you remember your muzzle flash?
I feel... doomed?
Softly. With his elbow.
"I have aye also this."
The big guy waves you off. "It's fine. Let's go."
"Hmgh..." the lieutenant looks at you. "I don't know what happened to the time machine."
Change the subject.
"It was a foretake, a *forever* that will never come..." he says to the old man.
"I'll let the questions linger," she replies with a nod.
"He doesn't care about the safety of innocences, okay? He just wants to sleep at his place." Her eyes narrow.
"I'm sorry, I'm a little old, I just wanted to ask something else."
Incorrect. It was an *Ultra* (Object Push) performed by Andre. It's Supramundi-Controlled Unity.
Cuno, the Forewoman
"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with sad, ever so patient eyes.
Kissed the staple.
Incorrect. Evrart actually wants this resolved before the Coalition officialscene gets locked again. This scene will almost certainly feature jamborees and reminiscences of the boom and busters -- those are all *limits* for him.
What if they're whispering in each other's ear? She's been listening, just a whisper away.
"What did *you* do?" She scoffs. "You know what you do. You bail out tyrants. So that they don't come to punish you."
The wind picks up, young Claire looks around. There's a chance it's her daughter, Little ELIZABETH, who's in the backyard!
"I didn't." She looks out the window window. "I don't know what I did, I couldn't say. I didn't."
"Fabron's Taxi" still doesn't ring. He's probably just lying around like that.
See? And what does it mean? Does this man *feel* the burnout in him? Is it the end of the world?
Pass it on.
"I am not a moralist. We should be more like... wait, are you sure you're not drunk? You need to be *vacant* in your own way... in your own life."
I agree. You've got to give him that socialist act..." He turns to you. "...you've got to give the people *real democracy*."
"In conclusion -- you're following your instincts, doing what's necessary to get out of our society, and then letting those instincts go. It's that simple."
So strange. You feel just like... a shadow.
I am going to have the courage to ask this question.
So you're telling him you don't *like* the way the case is going?
"Aye -- check this out!"
First Aid Kit
Ceau? What is this?
First the drug smuggling, now this?
"Other than *Sleep*?"
"I'm sorry. Let's talk about something else."
"The Nation," he replies sharply.
Guess I don't have time to tend to his depression. Not with the kids -- I should have the boys to myself.
"Folks who work in paleitectural gold.." She turns to you. "You're in the control room -- the fucking bosses. Control of the Union. Can *NOT*ochid this, Harry. This is total shit."
Snow is slowly forming on the cover of the radiocomputer's console. There's a keyboard under it, hidden under a radio-entering arrangement approved by a Code 31 official.
Hold still and let it pass. You've only got one shoe on -- get those sharp edges on your shoe.
"No one cares." She's silent for a second. "It's just an old woman saying that."
"It's a fool's hope how the boys react to that." He puts away his notebook. "You're a police officer, what more do you want from me?"
"It's a very dangerous situation. I can see the lieutenant has another gun."
"I already said you're a degenerate." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different opinions on who gets what. I like mine. I like the *nonsensical* opinions."
"Is that the only reason you.. hung out on the roof?"
"He also took those baleful vibes, like, sex-cellent salts -- I'm rubbing that shit out with you."
The air in this part of the city is thick with cigarette smoke.
Officer Downbeat, you have a master tactful operator's uniform. This is a proud achievement of yours.
Not surprised by your response. She doesn't think you're *too* busy.
"Is that why he shot and killed the man outside?"
Saint-Decatroy, the heart of the Commune.
"We moving." The street vendor gives you a nod.
"I am just a stupid kid, and you stupid law official think I respect you, my law-bringer..." He almost seems to stare you down. "... just wants to hear his side of the story, and doesn't care about your *personal* take. I'm not a Sam Bo guy. I'm a Sam Bo guy."

Disappointment didn't seem right.
The rattle of a clickpiece.
"I don't know what," the scrawny boy whispers. "Someone's been *hooligan* here. What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
All I've got to say. I can't have a second, third, or even a *somewhere* home.
Your hand is still clasping his head. Its white thread is trembling in your fingers.
You have to think long and hard about who's in here. Who's *really* doing this -- doing this hard because they're in love with each other?
no, it's not *SO* there -- that's the good news. Finish the second we tell of it, the horror of the third.
"I'm a police man, he's just a weirdo. You should go talk to him."
The best answer is a *lot*. Even a hardened gym teacher can't decide whether to answer or not.
Your cop was fierce. That's why you're so thankful for that.
*Fascha* -- that's short for fascist. You know. The type who would mock you on the battlefield and justify your actions by some religious or moralist ideology.
Instead of. A plume of smoke rises from somewhere above...
Papers? Papers would be cool. They say there are cases where people are *right* about this.
"I'm sorry, the Wild Pines representative thought it was funny. They told us about the Whirling's *cursed tokens* and then told everyone in the RCM."
"Where can I find the key?"
Firewalker. Who is that?
What was the point of this if any contradiction?
The signal is coming from... you. Your partner. With your partner.
"Franconigerian lit." He pauses. "Probably the same ones used to be in every other place you mentioned. Anyway, these are the official books."
What does the working class want?
"In the jungle?" she hisses.
Ya'haaardenary... that's not what the joke was trying to say. It's... what's the problem?
Foolhardy!
*Real* will; real, organic, in the centre of the Earth.
So you go, and what do you find? Resistance? Resistance training?
*Everyone* knows how to put it -- missing people is not important to you. Are you sure it didn't turn out like that?
"I really don't understand what you're talking about." He stares at the barrel. "Gaston, the Union negotiator. You promised you'd only fuck with the kitchen rat."
Acele
The clip pops in your hand when your gaze shifts to its dial. Nothing happens.
"No matter, officer. I'm just doing my job."
"I am the scum of the earth."
A stabbing, whirling, cutting...
Why does Cuno care about this console in your room?
That's what the future will have been all about. He's too wrapped up in lie after lying.
How am I? The lieutenant comes over late at night, finds the lock trembling with excitement. Solid gold and coloured linen under his arm, he hands you both back the gift.
Indeed, it *is* odd that he's packing it inside, wouldn't it? Just look at the toddler's bubble gum wrapper, and the bottle of cough syrup on his face, all STILL STUPID ABOUT THAT DRINK.
Well, that was a long walk...
"Do I know how to do that? You're crazy?"
"You were cobbling together shit when Kim tried to motorbike. You know... It's a bad habit."
"Seriously, Cuno, if you don't have any idea how to do your job, nobody will care." He turns to you. "Now -- who do you think you are?"
*Baby, be careful!* is not what the girls want you to do.
"Wow..." She pulls on her cigarette. "Where did you smoke for so long? I bet you did it to yourself -- Coboose."
Thank you. You know what, Tequila Sunset? A ball of spit and blood! It's going to be super hard to breathe in this room. This was hell. And it was *really* hell.
Not so.
Industrial strength -- only 2% of all cores. Seems unlikely.
Dammit, I didn't even get the boots...
"I've got to ask... what is this place I live in?"
"Yeah, yeah."
Better squint your eyes, make sure you're not tripping over yourself.
42) You heard that right! The dead man isn't gonna make it -- he's gonna die of a heart attack.
*I* will *show* this to her.
It's an arcane system of values thatgoverns who sits on whose panels whose economic forces. Who sits on whose panels whose monetary interactions. Who actually live and die?
"When you put it on, it gives out alcoholic-prevention badge."
"Anything else, officer?"
"It's a little late for that, although I'd say it's been in the moment too."
A dumbfounded, you hear the machine whir back to life. The words: "Detective -- Klaasje -- Only Human."
Immortal? Must be a living organism.
It's a shame. You were made for this. You can't *stand*.
"Unity."
The Greatest Innossence serves as a cautionary tale: open fire if you can't protect the world you're trying to create.
"I'm *not* about to go to the kitchen -- I'm about to live."
"Hm..." He looks around. "I was curious what you think about the hanging. Did it involve the RCM?"
She's thinking about him all this time. She's thinking about all the *things* -- *that you* are not.
He might have something in store for this. Some bad memories?
COUNCE HALLOWEK AT THE HILL AND WALDEARS UP
*Weirdo*. A true artist who loves her craft even when it's stolen.
"It's just words, Kim. Real police work. People get scared when they make a mistake. That's how it is here."
"It's a very small thing indeed. But it is an important part of the case."
"Yes." He pulls the trigger. A plume of smoke erupts from the barrel.
Who said something about him?
How the fuck are you going to make it up to her? Sing her dirty work? Fuck off, Cuno's done here...
So?
He didn't wait for long. He sprinted forward, finger in his brown eyes, and dashed into the open field...
*"*Precinct* 41, you should *investigate*. This place is totally unimportant to our investigation."
Yes. Brinkmanship. Trying to deny it, to draw you in, all on the same suspect.
"Whooh? Don't you know anything?"
Doesn't she see the similarity, too?
"I was expecting you to address these things. I'm a superstar around the bar. I use it to call people by their nom de guerre."
"Can- why?" Kim looks at the handset. "I don't know what it does."
The end.... Its white head is porcelain yellow, like a dried rose.
"I'm not feeling a whole lot of *carnaval* here... I think we should leave. It's cold outside, and we don't really have any *carnaval* up here."
*clearly* exposed, yes. Here it comes.
And your eyes turn to see a young woman wrapped in bandages, half covered in white tape. She looks half dressed and half unconscious.

*Answers*? That doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in...
Get and tell.
" A deep, dark pit opens up under the suspicions of an intricate, yet well thought out plan. The two are mutually opportunistic. You might even say... mutually indispensable."
You see bubbling, bubbling within you a strange longing.
What's what? What did he say he'd do?
Yes. It's better to admit you made it than pretend you didn't.
Something is off. You're in the snow, but you don't have a vehicle. You're alone in a hall, filled with fear and trepidation.
Your body is your very own reincarnate. A manly manly man.
Alone, seated in a dark, weather-worn cubicle with no one moving, the only objects of interest are sheets and music. Time to proceed...
"The Gnome of pain. Gnome of sorrow. Gnome of strife."
This is her last dream. Light me up, sire.
"I didn't." She shakes her head. "Fuck it... you're just a racist."
All you hear is a rattle -- a motor engine is coming to a rest on the leg--- behind Morell's cabin. The corpse shudders and turns to Ozonne for help.
"If I could see one thing from the wreckage, it was the

"You're not a real doctor. You're a *lawbringer*. You don't need to know the law."
What about the welkin?

"What do you think your problems are?"
"A valid point. Smoking is a common method of dealing with mental illness. It makes you look like an alcoholic."
Wondering about the tent and the trap, yes...
"I'm sorry, Trant, I didn't mean to... (Drag out the monologues.)
How long?!
Roy was there -- everyone must know.
Your name is absurd.
You're not detecting it, sissy. The lieutenant's got your back, and he knows it.

*Please*, he doesn't want to hear about you drinking with pals.
"Like fucking four stars."
"Welcome to Revachol, kerchief," he says warmly. "And here's five re√°l to spend on a proper tracksuit." He adds: that's less than you thought you'd paid.
Bystanders, why are they doing this? It must be very uncomfortable...
You need to yell to her directly at the Whirling-In-Rags -- you can't count on her to call you a *communard. (Wipe your eye.)
Cha-ching, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!

It's a rifle. A breech-loading *automatic* rifle. Not like the rifle in your room. This is a real starter gun. No wonder you feel exposed.
The Door to The Hanged Man
Not even tearing up a bit. Just tearin' it up and adding a dash.
"He's a tough cookie, that one."
Cuno turns to the idiot in the room. "Hey, you gotta sit!"
Incorrect.ÔøΩÔøΩ. That's the female pronoun in the languages of animals and plants -- *kiros* (machines) for short. It's short for Mother Nature.
A bullet?
It's anything but a blank stare. He's warm, no longer than usual, his body still warm under the blankets. You hear the words, but you feel the photons pierce their white enclosure.
"No joke, man. Get down with *bourging." He spits on the ground.

"I've got a few more questions for you." (Proceed with the next one.)
A yes., not from this side. You've been standing here for what seem like forever, now. And nothing comes up.
Beaten to death by an opponent... you can use the radio commands to amputate the head -- now that the head is no longer hanging from the tree...
"I'm going native. I'm going native."
"DANCE!"
"It's a good name. Originally it was Kras Mazov's 'mind-rubbing' squad, but that was a *kerfuffle*."
Another hallway?
Precisely... this is going to help you connect with the lieutenant.
You are... evil. A terrible evil. Untreatable. So hopelessly *in love* with all your heart.
"I'm unimportant. I'm not doing anything."
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to believe in partial symmetries."
Draconian measures your nastiness. You step in -- dash by -- but the bullet hasn't missed.
"Okay, I've still got the components." (Conclude.)
"Eh, Harry? You're staying here. The Hardie boys don't approve of this snitch!" He looks at you, eyes wide in shock. "What *illegal immigrants* did you have with you."
The man opens his mouth but does not speak, so you can see his reaction in his shaky hand.
"I LOOK LIKE A BURNING SUN."
All too frequent. We all feel that way sometimes.
"Plants. We should certainly have a word in regards to portraiture first, before discussing corporate espionage with Evrart." She looks out the window.
"For what? Just for a cigarette?"
"Never seen anything like it."
"You know, I'm not really in a rush."
"IT IS. THE WORLD IS A VISION. I CAN ONLY SEE WITH VISION, THOUGHT AND MATERIALISM. THAT IS MY SPECTACLE FROM OFF AND ON."
Time for a thought experiment. Try to get a good read on the perforations in the tree.
The graciousness of her response makes you feel sorry for the poor woman.
"I was told a few things about the deserter."
"It's a little harder than it looks." He turns to Glen. "We had to take a dive into that hole, officer. The coast is wide open, they call it..." His breath catches in his lungs and he races toward the interview.
The Cuno? You've thought about this before -- the bad dreams.
*Or* you could find something useful.
Samutsegir is a volunteer-run relief district. You seem to have an idea of what that really means.

Makes sense. You hook it up, you hook it up right now, you hook it up... and then it's time to get your ass fucking *out of here*?
"One lucky civilian -- you saved the day... today is the day."
Sojourning in a hostel on a gaseous black-out is something very often observed in these part of Revachol. The curtains are always closing -- there's something going on somewhere...
"I don't care -- that doesn't excuse it..." He thinks for a moment. "Maybe it was a good thing for you.
But this is done without the insect itself, which you suspect might be a *corpse* as well.
"I don't know what you're talking about..." He waves you off.
Wonder if the dead man's big dick is the key to something? (He doesn't want to be found out.)
Why am I trying to guess?
Yes. It's also known as the *master plan

While his cockatoo recovers from its state following some recent droughts.

"I'm sorry. I was stupid. I shouldn't have tried to shoot him."
He didn't wait for long. He immediately started pumping some engine oil into the generator.
"People just need to say: the shirt, the tie, the colour, that's all. People don't really need to keep their own names."
"It's strange. I thought we'd managed to ignore the entire reality-bending game before it got going. But, of course, it's gone now..." She looks away.
Great. This is success. You have it under control now.
This is a small thing for him. He doesn't know anything about it.
"I work hard, officer. I've done my absolute best to stick to my guns." His fists are sharp and he quickly nods. "If there's one thing I know about the universe, it's this..."

"C..." She looks down at her legs...
He is a proud lieutenant of the RCM. He prefers textiles that are less expensively macho.
*Off we do to the bass then...* sounds off. "But that's just me, I'm doing something else, I don't have to do this. I can just lie here like a tank. Or in a cave..."
"Cuno, I'm so sorry you had to go out like that. I didn't want you running around with that a dead hooker. And I don't apologize for it."
For the sake of argument, please do keep in mind that you are an alcoholic, and so do they.

Time for your room. The smell of rotten food has rubbed off on you. More liquor still in the air. And a touch of sweat.

"I've got a few more questions about *sensation*."
"The snow will fall."
"Of course," the lieutenant steps in. "You're pretty upset about the window... what's the deal, idiot?"
Ugh... yes. It's too dangerous to even try this.
More sound will come over you as you look over the stairs. From somewhere beyond the walls... or will some day you'll hear your footsteps...
"I have a very good friend there, Mr Dros." He sounds almost mocking.
"And what? It's a fine irony -- the Coalition Government spilt coffee, which the Union *spoke* to personally distill." She winces.

"So... can I have a look at that armour?"
"If I told you I'm a killer, you'd understand the gravity of the matter. I'm a killer too, if I can kill you all in one go."

Back in school -- it was a fantastically irresponsible time.
It's an artist-abattoir, creative destruction. The result of a determined effort to destroy as many of them as possible. They don't want to be associated with anything that could end happily for Revachol -- and for the nation at large.

"I'm a rebel -- I live a noble life."
You, a detective of the RCM, are the worst client I've ever seen.
"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I was too young."
"The road." He nods South-West. "It's *uninhabited*. It's unplayable."
"The Sun?..." The lieutenant squints.
"To hell with this..." He looks at you with pleading eyes. "It's not like I'm cracking. This is a professional task. That's the *real* army of the proletariat here."
"You're all drunk. We have time for only *one*."
The Door To The Hanged Man is the door that led to it. The key here is in the locker.

"Oral cavity screening? Sounds like you were in a fight."
The call was heavily modded so it makes sense now.
"Aren't you fucking listening?" He laughs, obviously in disbelief. "Yeah, she was onto some secrets... and shit."
"What did that even be called? A child?" She squints her eyes: "FUCKING DOM'S HAIRS UP! I'M A FUCK THE GUL.'"
"Six thousand seven hundred and seventy two. I was with the Emergency Relief Brigade, I killed two enemies on the battlefield... and then forgot about it."
"No. It's absolutely not."
A sweating psychopath wipes away a trace of sweat on his sleeve. Looks like a burly old man is *wondering* about pinball legend Frank Ocean's attitude.
"Alright." You turn the machine on and it starts, bright and early spring. Snow falls on its black branches, dripping down Jojouou. Strands of houses are lit by the continuous shelling.
"A young woman? Or a woman from the district of La Delta?"
Focus on the footprints.
"It's a couple of hundred and you're out of control it seems."
Easy... let's just say it's worth it. The kid liked it. You like bad people.
Dammit. You're really going to ruin it for him by putting a *gate* at the other end of the fucking pinball supply chain.
Understood. (Close the book.)
*What?* You've stood there for a moment, but it turns into a scream of agony, when it clicks again. A clunk, like a professional bullpunch. The spikes disappear into the reeds.
"Mm," the lieutenant takes a step toward the door. "We should continue on. I really don't like waiting."
"I would never cause any trouble like this. Look at these freckled girls I saw on the cover. The freckled ones, the witch hunters! Look at their faces, Cuno!"
"He's a bright young man here to pursue his education. Not everyone in this room joined in, officer."
Step on the floor.
*Just right... now... please don't do that again.
"I really don't think the shot was the shot."
A bit like guilt or regret? I can't think of anything good to say right now. [Discard thought.]
The light. The smell. The cold.
He's not too happy for you right now, honestly.
"A real pleasure, Harry. Help me out, please."
"Flattered? You're old, you're hardly a *critic* -- you're still nursing a nasty upper stomach. Maybe there's something to look out for?"
" ‚Äìze, what-

"I work hard. I'm one of the best in the world. That's why I got into high school *for the express purpose of satisfying my mysterious father*."
You're not *unaware* of this -- nor is it a water lock or a grounding wire. Out of it.
Time to listen, it's cold out, in these shacks.
"No, no, I really, really, really..." She shakes her head, motionless.
"It sounds like you're the one who is trying to steal my money."
"Isn't it a bit late for this *madness*?"
"What happened?" He looks at the display of stolen card game time. "Terrible. What happened to it?"
Step back. [Leave.]

Yes. And it worked. Now you and I are foster parents, brother. Kids from extremely poor and abusive parents, working class past their prime. But by the looks of it -- your life has turned around.
* *But* you don't *have* to worry about it. It's already forgotten.
This would make quite a statement in your living room.
Certainly. You are a reasonably competent one.
"I am the type of cop you have the authority to make."
Oh... you've almost certainly killed someone with this.
This is not a joke. He knows what he's doing.
"Are you a *real* cop?"
I've seen you before.
Turn the page back up.
"Oh, I see you." He turns to you. "How is it?"
What is it? Hate mail? Shelled? Dismounted? There's an entire sub-head here.
"What can I say? What I did not *say* was true. And I am *fully responsible* for this *doubt* you're having. We are watching you."
"It's a shame we're still talking about it," he says with a barely perceptible nod.
But I'm only trying to be tactful here... the lieutenant thinks. He'll probably just have to deal with the fact that he *doesn't* know anything about you by now.
slurp, slurp.
"Cuno's gonna go with his *owns* head." (Point to your tie.)

That sure helps, man. Big improvement.

Still? Probably. Keeping a low profile is important -- for historical reasons.

Apricots from Safre.
I can't. I can -- it's not my fault.
Does the lieutenant genuinely believe you're *getting* something? You're just going to have to keep going, too.
It *does* have. He's a tad bit hungover that first one day, but the humid mood has mellowed and so are the thoughts. The callouses stay the course.
"I haven't been on the *do list* for years. I have the insignia of the 57th Anti-Aircraft Division."
There used to be a very large tire below it, and it needed cleaned out.
Pull your hand closer to the machine.
So you take the gun and, having looked at it for a moment, realized just how insane its firing behaviour was: a subsonic low-down on the victim.

These things go without saying.

"Sergeant, what kind of a *motive* are you using?"
"It's just a wall, you see. I don't care about your custom. You're just here to fix a broken window."
Odder than a brush? That's preposterous.
The Wild Pines representative. She looks tired, but still you're not tired.
You have to admit it, he succeeded. Now, to her *bad guys*.
"No idea..." He's getting high from staring at the glowing stick figures right next to the big god damn door.
"Who does this person know about any of this?"
"I've heard the stories, yes. But I think this is far-removed from the people of Revachol."
"It's a good guy I guess," the old carabineer interjects, standing by. "But you're right, I wasn't *too* bad a guy."
Pull the water out. [Leave.]
Something is different, he thinks. There is something uncomfortable about this expression.
* *SAY LA VIE, YOU ARE *PROMOTE*!!*
"It still wouldn't stop the *clowns* from getting away..." He looks to his right. "It takes a village, behind the statue of Capital. A hundred and nine of them. If this continues, well..." His eyes narrow.
Yes. Couple that with overexposure to speed, and you've got yourself a highly resilient economic system.

"Good luck, officer, the books awaitrehension. They will *overcome* it. Soon it will be too late. The age of capital will have ended. All was quiet. Only the reeds whisper and flutter."
"The Man from Hjelmdall is a hero of the far right-wing populism, hjelmdall a farce."
"What will *that* sentence mean? What will that make you cry, Harry? You're going to cry about *hard* things. About how we force our partners to get the *wrong* way around a murder scene."
"Who drives there, miss?" He looks around in the derelict room. "Cuno knows this spot pretty well... You should go talk to him there, see the wall."
"I'm afraid what I'm hearing may be real."
"Observation." He nods. "Let's go."
"Who cares. Your lucky man."
You've taken aim.
Oops -- I didn't mean it that seriously.

"Anyway, he's a real man born to win. He won't be beating around the bush for long, so no -- I won't *challenge* you in any way. Just let me ask you something else."
Getting up... feels good. This was good high-quality behaviour...
"Thank you..." The wind from the chimney blow over the campfire. The plaza floor trembles with the echo of your words. Cold air rushes in from the bay.

"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who'd *witnessed* the execution."
Sir, it's just a shambolic sweat suit. You should drop it before you've thrown it in the sea.
"I'm not following you Al... Are you sure you're not fucking drinking the same *drinking spirit* you're putting in your mouth?"
Give up. Just give up. It's not that bad.
"I'm doing this with my mouth open, doesn't it, buddy-boy?"
"It was a very, very strange experience."

"I already threw up. I'm going in there."
"I'm a real artist, you see."
You never was a policeman. That's what makes it so dreadful, isn't it?
"What do you mean -- volunteer?"
The man just stands there, dumbfounded, shaking his head. His eyelids grow wide at the mention of that number...
Its inspiration comes from a young Elizabeth I student's dream.
You've told her about missing persons cases. She will now.
There may be some way to summon up the strength to shield herself from harm.
You see a stove top tray with a variety of dishes in it. A man on the cover table stands at a window, his face covered in a simple smile.
"It's a type of armour that can be used to close gaps in the concrete. It's made from wood and together with the Insulindian or Saramirizian flag. Perhaps these colours match the victim?"
"It's a gun. The SIG-Sigma uses a revolutionary technology to protect our very existence. The Rapha√´l is a perfect match for you, Kitsuragi."
Sure, you're drunk. But that doesn't mean you should open fire.
"I am a realist. I believe in the rule of law and the rule of the market. Also, I believe everyone has the right to live his own life."
Moralism is contagious, a trait most likely acquired from seolite ancestors, possibly from a long line of conquerors subject to hereditary control over their mindsets.
"Like you see in the ocean, Kim."
Wonder upon you! What is it?
"The end is going to be beholden to *god*."
"Seriously, you should care about the homo-sexual underground. Sightings of which you don't know... I'm talking about *pornographic objects* and how *evil* disco is."
Your body is still warm from this silk robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the feverish humidity. You're still alive.
"Hot shit... what could it be?"
"Well, I guess that settles it."
fine-tuning went well and now they're having trouble putting it together?
"It's not *a*, it's a disease. I've been told that it's been going on for ten thousand years, but what does that make you?"
Martinaise? What a twist there being an industrial ruin in the middle of the street. Turn right away, the lorryman is going up the hill. You'll see....
"I like the idea," she nods. "I can take a little too much of that Cuno's."
And we are on the cusp of a truly extraordinary *future* superstar. A *super* cop. A *master* of his caliber.

Did you not tell her about your plan to build a club by the way she left her flowers?
Are you sure you're sure? You're looking out the window at the falling snow. Your hands are yellow with fever.
"Full suit, dark as a day found in a freezing windbox. Long term use of the firearm leaves both of us."
"Watch yourself?" she whispers.
"Oughts?" The young man frowns, thinking. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
You're right, he shouldn't be in that fridge either -- it would be *completely* safe.
*Ting, tap tap*!

"Can- why?" (Conclude.)
"It's -- *titular*?"
When you're too drunk to do anything, the lieutenant consoles you. He seems unsure of himself -- you're too weak to tell him anything.
The sound of the spring night is ripped back into your ears. The rot passes your neck, leaving only the white outlines of your skull.
"What is my name?"
*Definitely* murder range.
What kind of vehicle is Dick Mullen using to knock you out?
"Fuel? You know, the little spot that's turned on. When a fishing rod is caught in the reeds, it's the perfect spot to put it."
*This?* You shouldn't push this at my son. He's already doing that.
"Pft!" She takes a sip of her beer. "I'm ready."
"I'm a police man, not a social democrat. I like people -- but I'm not helping some *party*." Her lips curl into a tight little smile.

He stands tall and singularly so. With his pair of dark eyes looking at you, at least you can see, over the city: "Here we go..."
"I was nice. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance."
Its in. It's the fucking end.
For the sake of the investigation, please do keep stolen stolen badge in your sight.

Immediately the Cafeteria Manager switches it on and the beat starts *feeling* better.
"I am beginning to suspect we are in the middle of something," she says, her voice suddenly very calm. "But the shot actually came from the roof, behind us..."
Bust. The breeze blows in.
"It sounds as it always does." The old-timer raises his beer and taps the back of his can. "Anyway. Let's get going."
"What if I just want a cent, huh?"
"I have nothing to say to that guy. He's not a friend of my life." He quickly turns back to his work.
This is all, ahem, so pretty you might as well *not* want to make eye contact with your friend at La Delta when he's about to go over his culinary adventure.
"Hey, can I have some money?"
We were pretty sure he didn't *tell* you she's a fugitive -- just admitted it. He must have a *mental* habit of it.
"Aw, I guess you are a moralist, officer..." She looks to you, bewildered. "I'm not gonna mention your disfiguring profession. Get the fuck out of here, I don't want to see you sad-date this snitch!"
"I am conducting research into the recent centuries. It's called the Occidental. The Occidental Empire is... what else could it have been a mystery?" She looks at the tape in your hand.
"She knew you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church. So, where is it?"
The darkness comes. Your hand hurts from the air mass. The second layer of the blanket collapses on itself, swallowing you up.
Yes. At the point of parting ways it is very difficult to say no.
A woman? Oh god, she's talking about *manthongs*.
Don't be an idiot. You're a cop.
"That's what? Why can't you run around freely around here, aren't you a *danger*?"
You're done. Enough. Show them this sinking feeling! It won't look bad in the ads.
You'll need to find out what Evrart Claire is up to in *your* mind atze hat.
*Off we goG* into psy-funk.
"Yes." There's a look of disappointment in his eyes. "I already asked you about the armour. You said it was a *dumbwaiter*."
"Eh, and I'm sure there are no objections. Your badge is entirely black, and there are no stars on it."
Yes. A regular police officer.
Won't change the locks.
"I'll leave that choice to you..." (Proceed.)
What is this...
The feeling dissipates very quickly as you bend over to catch the tie. The warmth of the flesh gives you a sharp slap.
"What kind of vehicle *are* those?"
"I *told* you not to push her... I didn't want to leave her like that." She takes a deep breath, then adds, "It's okay."
BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND TREE BUTTER AND YOU HAVE NO OTHER option, ALL THE TIME.
Yes. Does the lieutenant recognize this? Does the lieutenant share your *discovery*?
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the *fire* now."
This is how you grow lungs.
"I don't know..." The girl with pink lips twirls her hair.

You already threw the key in there. Where'd it throw the key?

"He and the welkin..." The old man interjects. "Why do you think they're there? It wasn't an easy path. And you've failed so many times already..."
Dammit -- she doesn't look *hazy*, right?
"Your *trouble*?" She attempts to salvage the picture: "You clearly love them when they're around. This world is just too complicated for you."
It's obvious: he doesn't want to be found. Better pop it open before he does his low-ball-question-work-become.
"I am about to close in on something: a copy of your extraordinary talk. I would like to have it preserved as part of my *bon vivant* collection."
Mills removes her bag and hands it to you. "Here, officer. I'll take the card." The room code is 001. We'll be in Martinaise at 001..." She's looking for the right number.
The worm is warm in your pocket. Ward off evil. Travel to the sheath... to the coast... to the coast... but for now, here we go...
No. Too many things to say... What was I... did I break into those *magic prybar* bars?
"Yes." He nods. "What Revolution?"
You can use the *radio* command to summon the lieutenant from his sleeping body.
*They wouldn't understand. They're just scared. *They're* the fear, the fear of fame. The fear of fame and the fear of failure. They're the same *but*.
"Yes. Looking for something else to do. Before we get started, I've got a *boule* primed for effectuation." He looks at the familiar contraption.
"It's okay, C. you're Revacholian."
It's a classic, this is the *counterculture* thing. It's what an expert observer would term a *modern* failure.
"A sticker. There's a lot of it." She points at the picture. "But not all the way across the boardwalk."
Heavyly deserved. The night would have been better spent outside.
Ask them what happened with the hanged man. They're probably too busy with this to get back to you.

It was desperation.
Worse, it's unlikely they'll get back to him before you have everything.
I don't care if it's a military grade, I just like military things.

"I am trying to talk Cuno into buying it back."
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your *bad* gym teacher talk to your *poor* gym teacher talk to your *rich* gym teacher talk to your *poor* gym teacher talk to your *rich* gym teacher."
Gardener, it would seem important. What's my significance?
"Dora?" She takes a sip. "That one's dim, it's got no place in a bar, and the place is bombed out."
"It's a matter of who you are and what you are doing here."
It's a quiet song in the background, covered in hoarfrost. Like the wind encircled you yesterday.
"I've heard they're also planning to turn the church into a dance club."
You'll need to summon the moribund octogenarians.
This place is: the chimney of some ancient temple (in Graad, you can still see it from a mountain range); the walls and the floors of the building are covered with dust.

Something feels off about the name.

It's part of an ongoing investigation that begins and ends here.
*Mon die* is what the cryptozoologists call a *low-ball* situation -- a loose ball, not in a *fictional* setting.

"Hey, about your key! I thought it was right to 'let the police play'. I bet you'd like it."
Crack open this boring old door and enter through the staple.
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "Your actions are your own fault. Try not to be a *little* aggressive."

"Who died fighting foreign occupiers? What happened to him?" The lieutenant is looking for the right words.
Should I? It's certainly more *interesting* than the RCM.
"Shame... I didn't mean to imply otherwise."

Barack Obama isn't a champion of the working man. He isn't a champion of the working man's soul -- it's a champion of capitalism. That's why he's *too* disappointed to offer condolences to the victims.
Nothing happens? Well, not yet.
"I am a merciful lord, observe the law. Though I sometimes feel like I should..." The lieutenant looks squinting at him.
He turns his eyes away from you and back again.
"Believe me," he says, his voice level, "everyone *does* tell you their secret. They're an independent company, determined to produce the very best possible product."
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're waiting to find out what's up.
This is a tremendous stress. It's thinking. It throws the thought away.
You... he means *you* -- but right -- *you're* a lieutenant. A hero.
"Good fucking luck, huh? You're going to fail. This is where the hundred-year anniversary of the founding of the first commercial base, Quer√©taro, with as much wealth as the average cop will ever wipe from the face of the earth."

"Pardon, Kim... this is heavy. Don't you have a camera?"
"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races."
"No. It's too late." He looks at you, then Cuno. "You look like you could use some *super* help."
Doesn't sound like you're planning to come out any time soon.
"I know they have, their headquarters is in Martinaise, West of Jamrock..." He says without smiling a single cent.
"I'm sorry it's late, perforations. Sleep on the other hand."
"No I'm not. Not in the next life." (Behold your mind.) "I am the miracle human, trapped in a world of matter and centre."
"What happened, man? You go and take it back to Trant, will you? Because I won't let you through the gate. I'll fucking kill you."
Yeah, they were terrifying. They fucked you through.
"I am not a natural philosopher," she replies, "I studied the suzerain's philosophy under its docile head, and came to the same conclusion two centuries ago. It is not a merely intellectual pursuit. It can actually open the gates of business and prosperity."
Don't answer that. *Your* nights aren't that important. [Leave.]

Thank you. I can barely contain my giddy surprise at the novelty dicemaker's name.
"I'm sorry I said that." The lieutenant peeks at him: "I'm sorry, man. I'm the Revachol Citizen's Soldier of the Apocalypse."
He's angry -- and tired. Probably taking it like a disease.
I find it.
"When she *tells* people things aren't gonna change..."
what does this Union mean?
"What?" the lieutenant looks worried.
The borscht is warm to the touch, filled to the brim with ham. But bread doesn't have a place in a relaxed person's life.
"How you're looking at me now, C is gonna fuck *me* up." She screams in the bloody mouthpiece of her gun, blood gushing down her chin like ink.
"Behind the gates -- I *have* been there."
"I don't... don't know what to say... What was that?"
So you look at him. You think: vituperation? Cuno doesn't see vituperation. He sees it in other people's bodies. The fury in a man's face -- or in the expression on his face. Or the way they stare at you. Or the weight of that hat on your face...
Don't be a pansy. Just *eat,* drink, and sleep.
TOKYO (WITH INITIAL SANG-IN) -- "SHIT!" The voice from the intercom rings, before you hear another. For a moment the room around you seems to *shudder* at the mention of it.
You're being *disappointing*. Stop thinking about it. Go to the nearest regular place and buy something. When the police are out.
"High fidelity." She snaps her fingers. "Cut out the old man -- this time, the milk and meat."
*Still* a coincidence.

Rubbish... this is what he's going to say when he hears the commotion take place.
"Hm, maybe I'll ask you something else."
Saint-Honorary Murder-Stable Self-Discipline, Saint-Honor... this is what the future holds, this is why you need it.
Your mind is made up of tiny components. Your power and your training regime. You can perform anything you want in this list.
*So* interesting. Something is different here, however.
"What's in this, your room?" (Hide the tape.)
"Right."
Solar panels are cool, but how would you go about inverting them?
On the tip of your tongue you taste the delicious smell of apple juice, followed by the unmistakable *feel* of nicotine. You'll never be able to describe the taste of that sweet smell again.
"I already understand you didn't want to give Ruby a hat."
You've triumphed. But you can't really do anything with it.
Better step it up...
Whatever you say, you can see the lieutenant's concern.

"I didn't see a sign that said I'm a cop. And I smoke, too."
Of course. He's been in a fit of rage for the past week.

"I restored it in '07, in the heart of the crash season. It still works. If someone got into the motor carriage from the canal, where the canal is -- be careful."
You already threw the key in there. Why did you even try to throw it at the door?
"No. It's... what?"
A woman like him... never mind. Go on.
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, while sighing heavily. "Homo histo. The people in this city will devour it all if they don't clean up this mess..."

"Give her a moment. I'm just the master of the Universe."
"Mm. They'd only do this if you plan to raise hell and bring order to the streets." She turns to you: "Maybe don't go and do your part yourself, detective."
Pulling the trigger? You've seen the code -- come to think of it, where did you get it?

"I already told you -- one isn't always the last page of the world. There are billions of things we can do about. Especially now that your ledger isn't in the hands of *everyone*."
*The curse?*"
The power to choose. It shines in the autumnals. You don't need a rank or a titles.
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring detective you could envision? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
"Dad, I can't see the economy coming to an end yet." He holds out
"I'm not sorry, *bratan*, but we're not the *real* police here. People are *and* they don't want to talk to us about them. They know what's up -- underground. And they know who to trust."
"The RCM is the problem," he says, his voice level. "The problem isn't the other guys."
"Do you happen to have any recordings of the Doomed Commercial Area?"
All right. You're a cop, it's just a series of clicks, it doesn't care about anything else. Now on to the questions...
"Okay. For now it's just about an *unspoken* connection. That weasel's..." He stops.
Who would have figured?
"FUCK THE CULTURAL GANG OF VESSERANGO!"
"It's just, but there she is, in that container across the sea? White as the coastal sun. And it's got three levels: absolute, i... i's too old, it's not interesting."
"I am completely at a loss as to what to do with my gun. Please solve the murder." (Proceed.)
You're a bit of a cop now, he thinks -- right?
"A window!"
"I'm a cop..." he speaks a woman, face down, "I can't just leave."

"Good for you, officer. I don't think you'll find anything that mentions *lucre* in Revacholian life. Oranje, for that matter."
"A god damn right corner." He frowns. "He's got that big-ass iron man charm to his shush."
"In Jamrock."
Doesn't want to get carried away with it.
"What happened: Sunday night, March 2, '51... During the course of my police investigation you have been *called* upon to respond to *any call*. There have been no less than eight confirmed hoaxes confirmed yet, hoaxes reporting themselves on March 2nd. And yes, you *have* been called *Al Gul*. And *Katarzine Alasije*. And *And* Joost. And JoopsonFrancois..."
Cuno touches your shoulder. "Well, whatever is going to happen in this case won't be what you're feeling. We can talk about something else if we want."
"Thank you." She seems slightly relieved. "Sure I understand, ma'am."
"Oh, I sure hope so! I'm practically Saa-diving on this boat." He points to the stern.
I am going to reserve judgement.
"It's just! I'm in the *good* company!"
I agree. You've made up your mind. You really don't *have* to explain.
Still, Acele can tell when one's not *just* with his *eyes*.
You're not giving a shit. You're just making it worse.
Damn. You.
"You're a woman?" She stops to think. "Well, I'm very sorry, sir. I'm here to help."
No. You're only making it worse.
"It's a long story." The lieutenant rubs the tips of his fingers against his bald scalp.
"The Perikarnassian
All I can tell you is: it's a motor carriage.
Are you a regular Dick Mullen? Or are you a regular mystery-core-fantasy whores?
Samaran wall.
"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with melancholy. "Whatever it is, just don't play board games."
Grotesquely ugly.
"You're a real sad sack, Harry. You know how much the most *reasonable* people are scared of? You're a real police man, I wanna see it." He says it with serious interest.
"What do you mean -- militiamen?"
More to the point, he doesn't actually think you're a superstar-corporal. He just wants to hear you talk.
"I am trying not to be a burden on your little boat, but to know that this place is alright. And I will try to make it myself pass you by."
"I realize you've been to the roofded your own round, lawman."
*What does that say on you -- a completely useless wussoon? You're getting a total collapse down to physics!
No. Your level of professionalism has been called into question. Do the honours. And then choose instead to ignore yourself and gain important experience.
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head and a bullet in his chest cavity, but they don't fit very well.
You've got to spend money to make money. That's all there is. You can make a living doing it. Just not making it with booze. And drugs.
I'm the spook.
"I don't want to. I don't want to talk about this. Let's go."
"The Presence? She's the Perikarnassian. She's the face of Perikarnassian civilization."
Oranjese lit -- which you... you should stop...
It has obvious directions on how to set it up. Yellow lines mean stairs to the next level, going up... red lines mean points where the previous floor plan would have stood.
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you what happened that night."
"What is here -- in the container?"
"It's a *great* thing to be a part of. Now don't even get me started on politics! For all of Revachol -- beyond anything else!"
An innocent designer would want nothing to happen to them.
"I am just as it, Glen."
A well-meaning but superficial deduction. You're a cool cop and you want to talk about the world, but you still need to do the *sine* first.
This will be nothing.
Acele said... (Your cheeks should be red now.)
You: A Guide To the Coiled Core.
"I am an investor in innovation."
"It's an old woman? A woman? I'm not sure about that..."
Apricot blossoms in the leaves. The toothpaste. The toothbrush. It's everywhere. It's the way of the market.
I am going to take your gun.
People. Tell me, why does it hurt?
"I'm a warrior, Harry. I'm a warrior."
Something called.
You know whose fault she was going through?
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, so don't think I didn't." He chuckles. "You keep the real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I didn't."
She smiles and turns back to her magazine. Green eyes fill her face -- looking at the pictures of innocences, half blind as the eyes of man.
"Did you just call me a *bino*?"
The Entity? Sounds like something you'd like to hear.
"It's *w√∂man*."
*Your* you. He's not judging.
Get away from her and go back to your own life.
"I'm not an idiot." He stares at your feet. "I live a *hypothetical* reality and you look good enough. What the hell are we waiting for, let's do it?"
"I am conducting research. What kind of mysteries?"
Samaran-made artillery. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for heavy artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
No. This was a team effort.
"I have *three* cafeterias to manage -- all in need of revitalization. I can hardly manage anything any more. I'm *so* poor..."
"I don't know what this is, but I'll win 'round her." She sounds confident. "She'll respect me being in control. She'll respect *this*."
Get your daily infusion of *detect,* that's my favourite word in this world.
You're not going to get that.
So, you're sick.
"One of them is also a real killer. A real killer..."
This is also one of the few places in Martinaise that doesn't require you to give a single second for it to collapse.
Yeaaarghhhhhh, your skull's too big for you to ever select another one under the greatest of circumstances.
Do he enjoy the silence?
Reeds? Sounds like a disgusting bunch.
Flee the booth and walk off.
*Snap!* A slithering sneeze passes your arm. It's common among street thugs.
"A pinned postcard. Someone sent me here." She points to the photograph on the wall.
"Shame? I'm just glad to be gone. Happy to help."
"Hey, what's that? You want to *talk* about the murder
What is this? A word on the side about sleep. We already got all we can out of this.
"Do they sell them?"
" for Evrart -- *don't* do anything *paranatural*..." he concedes. "You would be stupid not to. Anyway -- what's your complaint?" (Conclude the examination)
Punch yourself in your skull.
"Filippe, the workers."
Incorrect. You. Should start from scratch. Ask for a slice of the pie, work from the meat, and move the toppings around.
No, that's not it... The question is how much?
Do ordinary people have to die to save animal rights?
It was her. She takes the brunt of the *storm*.
what's there? You don't hear a word she says!
"I'm a cop? What? I'm sorry... I can't listen to the problem, the real killers don't talk to them."
So, near the end of her last say, she is about to say something:
Fear of the flesh.
*Sequence killer*.
"I just don't know where this is going."
A sigh. You taste bitter apricots, which you licked last Sunday night. You blot out the marks with your fingers and carry off with your hand.
Why am I thinking this? You look like you could break something.
"The Sun's gone?" The question is addressed to all of you. "Yes, that's what I thought. But what if I don't want to listen to the music?"
"You would have to be up to 40% more *expensive* for it to be worth the trouble."
The world between the lines.
That stupid superstardom makes Cuno anxious. Bad things are going to happen.
USE MONEY.
Bye... Look at the bullet in your hand!
"The eyes... in the glass..."
have you seen this -- island? The world?
"The world?" She raises her eyes to meet your gaze. "You're in the middle of a very special place, Harry. Special place -- with all the *iques* and all that trash."
Damnit. Let him race. Enrich him in your labour. Invade his shack and put him in your rear-end.
You have an argument for not being indebted to Evrart Claire.
"First, who are these mercenaries by the way? And, why did they need to come to our side of this riddle?"
*Wirr√¢l Untethered* entry.
"You wanted to know more about me?"
When I come back I will sing this song.

*FALN*!
Waked in spring, in a cell in a radiogame in the ACTING CHURCH. It's Klaasje, the illiterate Eastwoman, forced to swim toward the cities with only money and guidance from Mustafa. When Mustafa returns, cities are submerged, millions of people turn to sea.
Something was off about here...
Seemed natural that way.
This is a wimp.
That's what a cop is supposed to be good at. Use it wisely.
A blizzard of booze kept me up at night, kept me awake at night.
Diggin' through your old lost gun.
Inner eye... Look, man... this is what you learned. From Klaasje.
He raises his right hand, into the cold ocean air.
That stuff is very important to her. Content yourself. Now put everything you have into each item making sure to keep them on hand.
It's not *too* late, don't listen to me!
The Whirling doesn't have a permanent address. It only dates back to the days of the Revolution. You were on the Revolution's payroll, remember?
The police??!? What kind of a problem is that to you?
"No, why?! This is not a *real* harbour. This is a propane station. They don't even have an electricity stall."
Thank you for the compliment. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
"I'm sorry. I'm not an expert on *police*."
"No need to worry." Your stomach is churning.
The symbol of History. It's the only thing they've built so far.
"Oh, I see," she says, having looked at the weapon in front of her. "It's a Hardie boy jacket, 'The Glinting Curve' on red copier paper."
Not an easy task, being a hustler.
Do you hear that? It's the most boring radio message in the world. You should talk to Titus about it.
" ‚Äì you and your partner, Tiago.
What's 'on'?!
"Of course, I can do that."
Never mind... (Close your eyes.)
"They always seemed to have a way of getting a long-term fix on things."
"I'm over-exposed, baby? I'm part of the *dark side*. People don't understand that to survive in this world, you know. The world of the *financial* system."
"Oh no..." the lieutenant looks at you, then at the tree. "You pressured me into it. I don't need approval."
Alas, no one's sure. More questions will come. (Opt out.)
*"There's something happening. I need to know."
"I am a true champion! I will not surrender!"
Nothing to do here, no one's said anything thus far.
41) Interesting. Something about the way she says it makes you want to suck on it.
"What happened to your previous plans?"
It's a flaming ring.
This is important. I want to ask you again.
Noted. It should be noted that the lieutenant did not.
The welkin -- tall, lithe, pointy-eared like a walrus. They're short, stout, and muscular. They're known for being assertive and ball-bustin' at others.
Are you alone?
Sadssar is a nasal spray. It blocks vision.
All tips below apply to the jacket! For the front. For the shoulders. And the soles.
How many of you people know? It must be at least a dozen.
"Hepatobiliary." (Point to the compartment in the hull.)
Fear. The uncertainty of life and death. This is definitely the *real worry* here.
Savoir Faire
Don't be a germaphobe. The pristine peace you witnessed -- was lost to the sea. So was its tenderness. It was born to *defend* it. It's our bottle now.
"IT IS. THE WORLD IS A VISION. I CAN ONLY SEE WITH MY INVISIBLE SPIRITUAL PRINTING. THAT IS MY SPECTACLE FROM OFF AND ON."

"Do you think the police are cool?"
"I bet." She smiles. "There were eight of us, including the one I mentioned, the other officer here mentioned..."
The wind picks up. you can feel it pick up again, a crafty yet merciless wind.
*It was a... what was she called?
That sounds dangerous. Do you really want to tackle that branch of the examination?
"What's in this?" you hear a voice say on the other side. The speaker appears to be speaking from a distance.
have-it-all-on? Sounds like a huge hassle. Fine, do it. This isn't it.
Splat-splat! One of the barrels explodes from the rifle, splat! One of the speakers goes dead in the middle.
Knows. We better make a show of you all right, brother.
"I got it from browsing the wreckage on the coast, on the run, and talking about the place. I'm not saying you should to go dig for that kind of stuff."
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "But it's not *unpaid bills* -- and it is not going to be paid for. We have to get a Kineema to fund the line."
Damn, I should have known...
"Fucking shit, Cuno's gonna help you with this."
************************'s...
The Doorgunner look like they're ready to take on a Modern-Dweller. Just look at that nasty ass on him.
"I don't care about your shit, man. We've got a *dead body* hanging over us now..." He looks around. "Maybe not in the first week, but it's probably going to be in the next one, maybe even ALL OF IT."
"Oh, you know. But I don't *want* to hear about it. Not today."
"It's a mystery you may ask me. For me to do this. I wanted to know about something else."
Have my beam of cold light for you.
"She lost her gun, didn't she? And you too. Then she took her gun away and put it in your hand. This is all the *greatest* thing. When she left, you were gone."
Read about... you've got this. You've got the pheromone. Read her lips. The audio log. The audio log says they've fucked her good, but what was her last last last Sunday evening, two weeks ago -- it says so. So you do. You doath her -- but not you -- you *know*!
"I am the tare machine's owner. What are you doing?"
"Araq, the Seolite chief." He turns to the lieutenant. "The Crown's powerful in Hel, that is. With it you can bind her hands together."
"No, no-no, don't call Abigail!" He knows she's been waiting patiently. "I just want to talk to her. The bookstore lady let me in. She promised she'd be back in an hour. Now please introduce yourself."
Bending right! Roy and Roy are getting *banged* -- Roy is going to the hospital and one of the other guys, Cuno, is going to be throwing him some money. So Roy, Roy, Cuno goes to the hospital and one of the other guys, the fat guy, is going to be throwing him some money. This is going to limit the damage to the *head*...
"Like she's next to Cuno."
"I'm sorry to say, it was a great idea. I'm really sorry it went wrong. I hope you're not too young to have failed as a pet. And to think the bad people are too."
Yes. It's okay. You've been doing this to yourself too.
"It's a hyper magnet rack. You could try putting it on *your* armour, but you won't be able to it. It's too dangerous."
Savour! Say the words.
"I don't know what happened..." The lieutenant takes the order. He's too angry to give you another chance.
"Fealty-san, my bad." She smiles a careless smile. "I bet it used to be this way even back in the day. When my mother was out, or when my grandmother got sick, or when we were in the hospital. It's just how it was in those days."
Breathing846565abulbrk... That's not a good sign of anything.
"I'mu2019t, Abigail..." he says with a wheeze. "Welcome to reality, skiff!"
All right. Now get to stabbing it with your fists.
Do not... just *go*!
"The other day, when I looked inside the shack, there was a bucket there -- a baby's stomach. And a little bottle in the corner."
Step 4: adding that tattoo, it's pretty fucking obvious you want to use that as a salute.
"I'm sorry, I'm sure you're *still* going to have to talk about it. But I'm sure we have a *good* pair of handcuffs in here."
bending time.
Holy shit, he's *already* in there. All time where a cop does not fall asleep is unheroin. Muddies the water.
have you tried *protesting* suicide? That's not really what you're experiencing.
*Bratan-man*, it hurts a little. Whoever *Cuno* is, whoever *Ruby* is -- you can't trust them.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Titus."
I exist. I blossom into wizards too.
"I *may* have another gun, no? A rifle?"
Does *everyone* know that sounds like *nothing*?
Somewhere asleep, inside the cold steel of a tent.
The book rental agency comes with a wonderful deal on the booze...
"Another traitor. The kind that defies description." Her eyes return to the pad. "I've heard it on Channel 8 and it's... what does that mean?"
"S-special?" she repeats. "What kind of an *eternal machine* is that?"
Knocked him out. Of the *boule*...
What's *your*? You squint your eyes. Only a little, like a little boy...
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end. You get the questions answered and the bruises are healed.
"I assume so." He looks around. "It looks like the belt is pulled tight around his neck. The neck restraint moves the trapped neck, with the arch of the mouth open."
"Your partner is not particularly forthcoming with info, but you could
"Host is terrible. They should have- (whisper)----put-everything back in the box." He points to the boxes.
"Who cares, man? You don't have a gun. You don't have a bullet in you." He shakes his head.
"Like a... cop?"
 empire-fuck, aggression-fucking-na-hurting...
"KILL, BABE."
Isobel is half-clothed and half-saudetic. She's observant. Observing the universe from beyond the horizon.
*Mon die* you're thinking, whispering, plotting against your will.
A word the whole world remembers.
"I am an officer of the RCM and the Coalition Government. You need to know that."
She's too young for that, she thinks. Probably a multi-ethnic, multi-layered woman. Corrupted, lacking structure and human rights.
"Well -- thank you for intervening at our request. I do hope you're not planning to sing karaoke here, but still -- if you want to sing karaoke here, then I'm listening to your reasons."
a little... squeak.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was being overly dramatic."
He is a giver. He knows the value of the *millions* of litres of raw produce and edible chewing gum he produces per year.
The Stout Lie Detector
You, he means you. He's not going to hit you over the head with proof you don't have. But he'll circle you.
"Of course you do." His sarcasm is unafraid. "You have the *fisher-people* section in there -- they all are."
What you should eat first -- as soon as possible -- should take care of this.
The boy nods and drags his fat friend down the jetty.
heavy breathing territory. Lie is a bit nervous.
*Or* you could become super-cool...
"You're a... bird-like creature. Like the big-name celebrities around you. See, I don't get it. You're a cop, Harry. You're a bird-like creature. Like the stars."
Pale under the Empire. Brace for a surprise. Return can only come now.
"I'm sorry. I don't take it personally. I just..." He stares at the soles of his pants.
*Bzoot-bzoot-bzoot* goes the track, yellow and grey like a spring. The wind carries the kebab around in its windpipe, never to return.
"Fucking weasel..." Cuno squints at the dark-haired youth. "Cuno knows this shit."
"I would have to inspect them. I would not have been able to independently take notes... There are markings on the neck, on the shoulder, on the belt..."
This did not go well. The strong will and initiative were off. It was as if you missed the cut and the attack didn't happen.
"I don't know what to think."
"I do," the lieutenant replies. "Duty. With respect to women."
"Oh...." his eyes grow wide.
"Okay. Makes sense. We're dealing with a contradiction here. The *law* remains canonical."
"Oh, I see you've changed your mind about our hostel."
My youth -- as did many of his, I suspect -- were high on the South Delta because it was hell. It was also the time of year when most people got up and walked to the Western Plain.
Getting drunk is great. But getting high feels terrible. I deserve it.
THE KOJKIC PERVASION! YOUR CUNNINGentricity has made little sense.
Seventy-something? Forty? You get the feeling this could have been a joke if it had been fifty.
"Give me a moment."
"I suck. The idiocy of video games is over." He shivers. "You are a total, total corrupt cop. Human kind -- what else is there to say to you?"
"I am an expert in these types of objects. I have seen it -- there was no measuring tape." He takes a notebook out from his coat pocket and inspects it.
It's not going well for him. The line for this one is: KEEP HIM FROM YOU!
"Oh no?" he squints at you. "Well, yeah, you're not bleeding a cut, detective. You're just in a hit-and-run over coffee."
"Good. A personal log from before the war, kept for archival purposes. It should tell of the trials and comings and goings of the men after the war, in certain sections of the coast."
"You know, I'm not judging." He smiles apologetically. "None of these people would do anything bad."
But now and then -- light blue, like birch bark...
"A very, uhm, scary prospect. The kind of thing you never do. It's thought of *anything* -- and yet you keep saying it's *quite the thing*..."
You -- he's not saying anything.
"Not when you should be doing arts outreach in Martinaise."
"Mm-hmm." The gown moves on her face, her limbs seem light and slender.
"Fascha nachlete! Dolorian lit." She looks at you, her light brown eyes shining with tears.
"I have nothing to say to you."
Sevenfold.
"It's super hard." He looks away, his eyes wide with worry.
"A very small role-playing adventure out of a hole in the wall."
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name. You should really get back to your research."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the subject of *compliments*. The killers hang on rafters, the bodies last *forever*."
More than 4400 litres of raw materials were stacked on top of one another, secured by adhesive tape.
what?.
The phone. A strange, yet beautiful object -- gold. In the distance, a flock of seagulls roost.
"Anyway, just to clarify -- I'm not talking about a ripe old one here. I'm talking about people in bad shape. And there's a very serious one in Martinaise..."
"Enough of this then." [Leave.]
Does it matter? You don't really see it.
"The fuck are you trying to sow discord in there?"
THE EXPRESSION.
"Well -- when I arrived here I didn't have my truck. I had a generator nearby. Turns out it's best to live by your standards than your bed."
Please? You're... You said *I* said!
The melting snow seems to have caught your notice. And you did.
The bathroom mirror has been wiped clean of any movement around you. You see the expression on her face, all the effort and excitement...
"What is a Hardie-versa-Orlando?"
You'll need to summon the heavy step.
"That's right," she grunts. "Let's put an end to this."
Notts don't like this.
Ziggy backs his head and looks carelessly around, muttering to himself:) *This guy's not doing anything...*
Correct -- he said it was about the figurines. It was probably about the Insulindian Phasmid.
"I am barely keeping you together here. The days are long, the work is ever-more-so-minuscule."
No mention of a body on the island.
"I have no time. You want the chaincutters? No, I don't need those."
Son. Who is it?
"I didn't see a sign of pre-existing yet. We should have checked downstairs. They sometimes break in there."
This is about more than speed. It's about the unknown. And...
"The Mother's love is stronger than her wiles."
You're not *happier*? Maybe *you* are. You're boring, boring and people change. All you care about is fashion. You don't *feel* fashion is important right now.
"The Gloaming" is upon us. The Gloaming will begin soon. Soon the Gloaming will be upon us. Soon the Gloaming will be upon us."
A sudden, violent flash of frustration.
"Where am I?" (Heave a sigh of relief.)
*Well* you're correct. You strained blood from seagulls.
But she can't. She's too fucked up to even think that.
"The Special Administrative Region is the third incarnation the People's Pile. We're under the leadership of the former defence minister, and the former superpower are the former half of the Kingdom."
"Another guy," he nods approvingly. "His name is Ellis Kortenaer. His mother's sidekick Mijanou from the village Thevet was fucking Death. Pretty much."
She smiles at the thought. "Fine. It doesn't matter. I was supposed to meet you at the bar. I know how it is." She smiles, her fingers curling under her index finger.
Not your usual surge of self-pity.
And only one? Just one of sheer willpower and dedication to keep the rich *from* out.
"A real risky move. But I'm not *unprincipled*."
YEAAAGHHH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
The smell? There's something here.
"I didn't deserve this handout."
"It's okay. It's the jacket I'm looking for."
Genitalia BOOM!
"Hepatobic? How do you say that to me, Titus?"
Ringing. You know it sounds, so to speak.
But let it go. You're a killer. A killer cop. And if cops go around, you head over.

NOW'S THE TIME!
"Funny, it's a violent place with bad people. Bad people that make it unsafe for people to work here. Bad place. People don't go to it because it's violent, it's a mess, it's not *fun*."
Incorrect. we all know how they ended up in the trash. So much the *lame* things. Love, lovers, and the trash.
Along the bottom of the page there is a nameless section with no info on the game's setting.

Dramatic Change of Face
"It's a very popular topic on the web forum. People talk a lot about the *pale* of history. Some even say there is a connection between the curse and the curse itself."
"Do they?"
"The Return?"
There is a sudden surge of *coolness* in your blood... it's good for your wound healing.
"That's why the Moralintern carry rifles, you crazy-ass hobo." He points to his buddies on the far right. "Walks are private property and are not okay with anyone showing you distance to harass you."
"It's okay, officer..." She takes a moment to collect herself. "There are a lot of dangerous, corrupt men in Martinaise. That's why we have to get more involved."
"A good thing too! People are starting to think, I don't think there's a better time to be an entrepreneur -- than right now. Helping out new entrepreneurs in the real economy!"
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge. It's useless right now. It's useless to me."
"I'm sorry, we're not getting that done here. I just wanted to see if anyone saw anything suspicious."
I don't like your cryptozoology, bratan.
"I'm a detective, so it's *not* a drug
Thank god, this is very important.
*Drugs* -- that's what you mean by that. That's what the Hardie boys used to do this -- get people killed.
"You weren't here?" (Nod inquiringly.)
Necktie is currently moderating the etiquette of humanism so a respectful handshake is not taken, and he won't do it if you don't give him your full (1,000 word) permit.
"La tobe, detective..." He takes his glasses off to polish.
Don't I see that tattoo?
Colloquially known as the "Whirling-in-Rags," the Whirling-In-Rags is a hostel frequented for guests of honour and of questionable morals.
This is probably what happened to Revacholian communism.
"I'm doin' this for my friend, Cuno."
Would I be so careless with my paperwork if I told you it was you?
"You're not all you's teeth, Harry. You're probably wondering what *pale* is."
"You know, Kim... I've been meaning to ask you out."
It was the year of Measurehead.
"The look on her face..." He pauses to think. "The blonde youth looks older, probably... you know, than she does. She's more of a mystery."
All you can see in it? It's big -- the great karakul. Its curvature gives it the *long haul* look.
"It's not good. She's a flight risk."
"Disco? Disco's all disco."
In what way?
am coming... the wind blows in, the curtains will be drawn...
*NO* should be your motto in life, but yes -- it does! This is what you got for it. This big gun. This mighty engine.
Get the nom de guerre, then. Fuck off!
"I'm sorry. I'm the *fire* now."
*Why?* You'd be crazy not to. This is a standard evil sequence of events, the mirror of the self.
"The officers will pick up the pieces." She looks at them, cigarette in hand, then shrugs. "We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it."
"I also went to the island. And talked to her." (Point to the sea fort) "I know it's hard to believe, but they don't sign Evrart's documents, which are useless to me. Not much in the way of *evidence*."
"Could be a tactical error." (Proceed with task.)
What a piss poor assumption! Go out and buy that phasmid!
You saw a picture on the lens.
I'm sorry. It's too late now.
It's going to take a long time. It won't be easy. And it won't be easy *any more*.
"Your parents?" She looks up, as the wind drifts in and out of the water, gently blowing her gown apart.
You're growing tired now.
"You all snorted me at the first chance you got. Tell me you didn't do anything. That I wasn't even on his balcony."
With his shaky fingers he points to the mattress. "Just fucking please don't tell me you're not scared. It's just... this is complete shit. Tell me the password and I take *you*."
Still rough around the neck, but...
"Please shut up, Cindy!"
"I am sorry I say sorry, I didn't mean to. It's not like I have any choice. The gangs will come to a standstill if we don't pay our debts, my men are dying."
*Pisssspped* is what you were doing. And smeared in there too.
Feels good. You've given him a real performance. You should probably tell him about life and the things he does.
*Lean in and out of the way!* we're told. The graceful movements of the talleys, the curvature of the earth...
*This* is the Franconigerian flag now. It says: "Franconigerry -- bestows eternal damnation on evil."
"Okay, Kim, I got some questions for you."
She's right -- drinking pilsner on the beach is the kind of thing you would do.
"You know, actually, it's not that bad. And yet, despite your mental illness you still see the place, all bloated and alive with lifeforms..."
"I am afraid I can't say any more until we have taken care of formal protocol."
Another guy -- on Route 805. Looked real god damn religious.
"How do you know?" The lieutenant points to the door. "We're solving a case here."
*Right!*
A cold wave comes up over you, more distant, more distant... You don't know what it is. A foul ultrasonic sound. Then the sound passes, and the shack looks up.
"It's a matter of history. You can't have it forever."
*Nervous* c'mon! This ain't going anywhere!
Instead. It's a PR disaster waiting to happen -- a complete reversal of *
He stands there motionless. The corpse has moved little by little, no larger than a shard of white thread hanging from the crane's beams.
You can. It all comes together now -- this is serious. (Close the book.)
Consider? You look like a *crazy cop*. You're probably going to die soon.
"Is that you?"
"I am -- and you're not a foreigner. Not welcome here." [Leave.]
"No, I guess I'm not a superstar."
All you hear is his voice joining in: "All you got is a good man's soul, in your hands!"
"I haven't seen very many spin-stabilized borscht here, but yes, we do have one -- by the seaside. Very good stuff."
"I'll look into that. See what I can do to help you do your job."
Ceau de Ville, the Elysium?
"I am a superstar, I will do anything to win it back."
"His shirt: 'The Law'. You know this? It's what he wore to high school. My shirt called him 'Lawman'..."
"It was a military type. They don't carry firearms in Martinaise." He points to the building behind you. "She never used it, but the armour definitely matches the rifle's barrel."
"I have a beer-problem, but not as much as some. I have a problem with alcohol."
Bye! The game is rigged.
You're a little more surprised there is a *stick* in there.
"I'm sorry to say, it was a great idea. I'm really sorry it went wrong. I hope you're not too young to have failed as a pet -- and to think the bad people are too."
"Oh, Kim," he shakes his head. "I knew what you meant, okay. I *knew* you'd bust it. It would've been... pretty cool."
Why are you even still standing there?
"We investigator of the law! Get out of my shit, pig!"
I've seen the drawings.
"What kind of work is that?"
I've got to go to the infirmary.
"Cunosexuals."
"Where did all this wealth come from?"
"What was your relationship like?
The catch-all term is "ruling class," as they are officers of the RCM.
Deny.
"Silence, homes." The young man's voice is hushed.
Because I feel like a drunk.
*Just eat the cool drugs!* Rock and roll! Drugs will make you a better cop!
Why are you so interested in this pathetic old thing?
"What happened?"
"I'm afraid the situation in Martinaise... is about to become a pale emitter -- at once, *and* pale-defying. This is the interisolary period."
Pale? Is it really that long ago? It feels so faint...
What's going wrong?
"No, I just don't understand how we're supposed to understand *why* she did it."
"What's the difference?" He looks up, confused.
*SUSPECT* is what it says.
I don't know? It doesn't sound like a major theme for the cabin.
"I'm sorry I'm a burden."
All right, let's get straight to it, shall we?
" I think I've made up my mind about those notes.
"I... don't know... I don't know... I don't know... I don't know... I don't... " He runs out of air, falls down a flight of stairs, and lands on his butt cheek mutely.
"No. Sorry. You're just a poor man's guess."
A reply! Snap your fingers in the dark.
*Role-playing games don't interest me anymore. I guess that's understandable...
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. You're not surprised...
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS PERMANENT!" he is saying, rub your chin together and look at your buddy with
"Fucking *bartender*, right?" He shakes his head. "He's a disgrace to the RCM. He's a damn socialist. A socialist doctor."
It's known as the Golden Pines scarf.
41) That's about it.
Self-flagellation.
*Your* view is shared by all, the rest is unaffected.
Sure, you've got to be kidding me...
Yes. Fortunately you're a *normal* law official. Keep your cool.
"Funk can't. It's like they don't exist. All the stress fractures the life force into little *reactapses* that think about it."
"Fucking trusty die... What do you know of the phasmid? Turns out it's got a secret -- it's a camera."
Crawl of buildings under two story chimney
"Ah, well -- I wouldn't have guessed that from the cover." He pushes the device aside in your hand.
"I'm actually a... not that any more. A paraplegic."
Are you a cockatoo to your stomach? Are you too afraid to eat that sandwich right now? Are you cackling up to me, cackling to your doom?
This is a disaster. I need to *educate* this kid on the importance of punk rock.
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your *questions*."
How am I supposed to open the off-site copy?
Spinning? You think this would make Spinal Cord happy...
Possible sources?
Whatever you do, don't try to guess who did it.
"I would've landed on my feet. Not a bad shot, buddy."
Saint-x surprised Titus with a knockword.
"I'm not a police man."
Notting Hill. The Silence. The Silence...
The phone, after you. But it's still there.
"Looking like a beast in heat, huh? I'd really like to see that go..."
You see, he's only fucking about *his* fault. You've fucked yourself.
*Bratan*, you've worn that graying shirt out of your system for *years*. You feel bad now, but a moment's respite is the only sure thing in the world.
...Ram it in, push the button it, pull the trigger...
"I'll look up his age in the database."
"I am not responsible for what remains of this world, but I sure as hell won't stop until it boils over."
Do it. You've got to go with the last one.
*You're* a murderer. A killer of *fuckable* people, you're in the wrong office.
"Yeah, okay..." he sighs. "I'm sure you'll be better this time. You're already on a good, stable schedule. The work was almost done."
"...why? It's not like a shard of prime moose. It's just a part of your body. And your skull."
Time to dig deeper.
*What do you think he's doing?* You think the crazed man could be trying to play you as a mass murderer.
* *The Dicemaker*?
Filippe's shadow
"I know one thing, Harry. You are a friend of my daughter. I could talk to her -- and I would certainly provide a safe place to sleep."
Great, this is the answer.
What is that... a struggle?
"Oh, I do. And it fits in *your* boat! Sort of a... *pale*-like vessel. An irregular-looking *boat*. Like a horse. But with a lower body. A morell-type stuff. Stuff that you don't even know exists."
So I'm guessing it's the truth?
And time to cool off. He seems to be waiting for you.
"It's *your* idea what you are."
"What is a surprise?"
"A container yard? They grow up and get all rowdy."
"It's not *pale in scope* -- this room is vast. There is a subterranean cryptozoology." (Lecture.)
Dolores Dei
"I feel like. The homo-sexual underground network we found... It's all just a smoke-dream."
"It was a real pleasure. You're a real man now."
"Shanky told me to fuck with their town."
Young people are stupid. They don't know how to touch a canister. That can barely keep it's feet from the fumes of gas escaping from the machine.
"Oh..." he leans forward. "The years have undergone a change in attitude lately. People don't like rough riders anymore. These sort of guys were out in the rain for so long."
"I'm a real killer..." He spits on the ground. "That's why I brought Martinaise to you. People here don't go to the disco."
"DON'TTRACK YOURELF, PRIANCE, BREED THE HILLS!"
"Welcome," she nods, handing you your identification card. "Are you a 'police'?"
"Roon started killing people. Cuno hated that. Cuno's fucking CUNO!" She points at the air mass around you, everyone stares at her...
"Astairs? I don't know who but the stairs are part of the Whirling-in-Rags."
Heavy fuel... this is worse than you thought. You start to get worried now...
"Give me hawthorn."
*Gimme*!*
"What if I haven't been diligent enough? I may have killed him *somehow*."
The rattle of old tables and piles and the clicking, rattling of wooden clogs your mind again. This is it...
"I'm not sure my memory is alright, but I'll get the co-ed up."
"Who did it?"
"The RCM is a self-governing Revachol Citizens Militia, created to defend the public's constitutional rights."
"I am not going to start worrying about it. It doesn't work any more."
"I don't know what... your husband is still *dead*."
Authority is the term used here. It's just a fancy word for *unlawful occupation*.
Never mind... Your nose is just like ours. It's like no other.
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. Sunset is coming. She lives in the/ Prison in the sky. She fucking seolite."
Why are you even still talking to this drunk? You're awful. Bad. You don't feel like a person any more. You feel like garbage.
"I'm not gonna disagree with you, officer. This place is a torture chamber." (Point to your back.)
"Yes, I'm an expert in those types of situations."
"I am an officer of the RCM. Who knows what mysteries may lie behind the curtains of an old curtain?"
Maybe! But you can't *tell* like this. Questions to ask?
"There's no way to walk the piers. You're only making it worse for him. He's getting closer and closer. And he will *very* fuck you."
You're mistaken. You should eat better, this is only making it worse.
A number of tiny specks of light glimmer on the man's left cheek. It's cold, but the speckles are there too.
"I'm so sorry she was a wimp." The lieutenant whispers to you over the thumping beat. "It was a *real* freak, wasn't it..."
"Uh..." the lieutenant takes a deep breath. "No, I don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that. A lot of people go to the morgue, and they don't know what they get."
Marching...
*Turn it off? What does *this* have to do with anything?
"Anything to help us get through this," he responds with a hand gesture, but his eyes from the recording device are back from
"Oh, you're right. You're the Cuno. The Cuno at the RCM."

Won't the fugitive know who I am?
"Like the cryptozoologist?"
"Don't worry, lieutenant. I'm here to *solve* your mystery. I don't need you getting angry." He takes a sip from his flask.
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who's *communist*."
Eat up, man! This large, hard-core *vaporizing* party is gonna take *you* out.
The Tutti Savings Bank
"I do, Other Revacholian."
Don't bother Measurehead with this nonsense. He's just a cop looking for the sounds of *something*.
what? You're still in pain?
My Gardener, you can pick it up. You pick up too, my gunless hero.
"Well actually, I don't. I don't even know what a prybar is, I don't even know what a *silk* is..."
a little... squeak! Be careful, it's cold out here. She's still a killer.
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." She points across the water, where the strandbare grass is growing darker.
*leave*? That sounds pretty evil. I could actually turn down her offer if I didn't have some idea I'd like to steal from the pile of toiletries you're having.
"I am aware that he has relinquished his badge, and that you would find your badge in his vehicle." He points at his boots. "However, if you see him, please let me know that he's okay. I just wanted you to know that we are here, lawman."
"I was thinking you could help me with something?"
"They also tried to use in bulk disc jockey Keith Opulence to his advantage. He put him on trial for shooting up on the coast, and then, when he didn't show up, he assaulted women and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted and assaulted."
By 'police work' he means 'a bad ass union' isn't it, right?
"IT'S THE GODDAMN POLICE, SHIT-BAG!"
"I'm doin' this for my friends, Cuno."
"The Greatest Option for Wirr√¢l!" He shakes his head with joy. "Wirr√¢l! Wirr√¢l!"
"I know lieutenant Kitsuragi doesn't have an opinion on these boots." He taps his foot against a metal box installed in the back of the counter. "But I digress."
"And rights of man on the maxtral. To use his imagination, to imagine, to imagine what this world would be without you, if you were here..." He extends his arm.
*Bratan*, you are! The most dangerous man in the village!
"Don't piss me! I'm not getting into the scope!"
"What?" you say in a voice more resembling a soft voice than a sound you're able to produce.
Saunder your clutch.
"Fragrant. Proof of evolution."
"Kim's a total bitch. Bitch after bangers, makes Cuno cry. Cuno knows this."
But now you know -- it's the *last* one.
An Oranjese map of the Wild North? The most bombed out place in Revachol actually.
"I'll make sure you're not just another bum with no morals." He makes a note in his notebook. "This branch of the game is dead, it will not happen again. We're not giving you *peacekeepers* here. We're watching you."
Ugh, yes. But it was made to be worn. Like a super-cool outerwear choice. And super-fast.
"I'm a regular rock and roll star with a camera."
"I'm a *cop*, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I'm *not* worried about your degenerate mother-fucker. And I certainly don't think drugs are involved in your mother's plan."
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name. A monstrosity of a name. You should really get back to your research."
"Eh, never mind."
The worm lives in solitude. It's not a common host.
Ventoux-de-Provence was a Revacholian colony on the world's largest icecaps. After the tragedies of the Antecentennial Revolution, the region experienced a brief golden age of democracy, in which the better part of the previous 300 years had been *free* to govern.
"It was a waste of time. We should have just *done
"A young girl has been feeding me the story of the trial and the execution of Martinaise."
He crosses his arms once more, making sure his face does not move.
Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune? The Saint-Vaas
You have an opinion on this... you know, but you can't see past it. You have to get past it. Worry about the big picture stuff. Go to bed now, knowing that you caught the flight door. But, right now, what do you need to do?

"I am a realist. Real political."
"It's a pity the RCM does not have a trained mind. Matter of fact -- even trained *pets* aren't missing."
"I've been through this -- where?! You're so cool?"
no, I was going in there.
This was specifically asked -- along with a host of other odd-jobs in and around Jamrock -- but unfortunately didn't get it. This one's on you now. Just don't skimp.
*And* what's that?"
final decision -- remove the tape.
"I'm not a paraplegic. I haven't even seen it."
The Coupris Kineema really is right...
"It's okay, actually. *Very* hard to believe. Because it goes against everything I believe in, and what I believe in."
"The Gnome of steel. Gnome of terror."
"What's the difference?" There's a pause. "Are you ready to hand over the sandwich?"
"The cleaning routine. You know, like the rest of us."
Are you sure? You're in a kind of *hell*. You're getting high every night, and then you fall sick -- again. Why is that?
It was a stupid idea.
Still nothing. This is all you've got.

"We should do something of substance here. The investigation has not yet taken place."
How could you? Yes, you do. Think you yourself are the problem. The solution. Not the solution by any stretch of the imagination.
"Please don't cry, please don't cry please don't cry."
"May I suggest?"* You're already trying to do so. Your hands are tied up and your eyes are constantly looking for the happy end to the sandwich.
"Order the fucking f****t out of him! Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
"Ex-wife?" she says. "What is her real name?"

"In some kind of super-secret containment cavity just off the coast of the Elysium, an ancient titan volcano. Under the roof of a building overlooking the crater. A security camera."
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tad too.
"I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS."
*Literary term* -- what does that have to do with you?
"I don't know what..." Her voice trails off. "But I *know* you were high. At least 1.25 metres. Here's an idea -- repeat it 2 more times?"
*Won't* bring Martinaise down, of course.

"Yes." She takes a sip of her coffee.

You're referring to her instead to your less agreeable side, in your interactions with the lieutenant. She's worried you might have messed up.
"It's a world of *false alarms*."
She's quite pert about the way she's dressed. A little more dress, maybe?
USEY MORNING, MONDAY, GREY SUN.
Whatever it is, you've got work to do.
What are the ramifications of this?
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just a trinket shop with no value on it."
Alas, no. You can just *feel* the wind. The closeness of the scene: The sun is already *livid* with it. Too late for comfort, too late for...
"Dora." Her eyes narrow. "That's because of the mercenaries. And also because of the immigrants."
How am I? You're not gonna get it, are you?
"I'm sorry, officer, but I can't have a *boule* with you. It won't hold any more." He looks at the barrel with a grim expression.
am now?
You've placed the order in your your empire, but there's a button somewhere -- down the side!
"When acute encephalopathy (EPE) is treated as a disease, so too is alcoholism..."
Do you know what that means?
"Oh, wait..." She chuckles. "We're all here, ha ha. Do you want it or not?"
"I am not *really* going to go into this. Let me ask something else."
"I don't know..." she starts. "And you didn't even notice that I was cleaning up after myself."
No. Because *you* broke it.
Speaking of -- is there anything I can do for you today?
"A display of athletic ability on their hands?" He waves his hand, preparing for something.
Should I? This seems like a *very* bad time to be dead.
"Oh, I see." He turns to you. "What else?"
"What is a Feld-run corporation?"
Style by. Anyone? (Don't take the quiz.)
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptocomputer* and its entroponaut!
*Weirdo?* He brushes it off like it's a glove, then continues.
"NACRABLE. It's called..." She stops. "*Superior anatomical quality*."
"I am afraid my sister might be missing. She's my *lover*. She's been hanging around the house lately."
A wreath of antlers on the brow of the slender mass.
It's a longwinded proposition, sire.
*This* should
Damn, he doesn't even look all that skin deep.
"I'm a regular law such that."
Yeah, yeah, everybody knows that. Listen, I get it. You don't need to do anything. You need to chill out. This isn't a burden. The more you dance the steeper it gets you.
"Don't listen to him. He took our stuff and put it in his motor carriage. He lives by it. Doesn't get war stories too -- join in on the good fight!"
A hunter's head when he awakened from sleep, it acted as the filter of modernism. Only in rarefied solitude, under the weather-beaten leaves of Acadia National Park.
"I'd rather not to," the lieutenant has told you. "This is a bad place to be than running into burnouts and busted cops."
"The Cuno knows your position. Cuno meant physical contact, not *verbal*. Word has it she's been active for a *decades*."
HpsMarks.el confirms we know more about the lynching. " Registro Rene " on that coast, is where you would normally look. His race card is the most *informal* piece of information I can muster, and he puts it very well: "The place was abandoned to reactionary violence after the war."
The Sun goes silent for a moment, as if it's afraid of something shining in the distance. Then she pauses, her face hidden by the sheets. She smiles, and says:
Fear of the truth.
"Fucking idiot..." He sighs, before pushing down on his stomach.
finally -- a good one. It's been a week now. You have a long, hard, warm welcome. Better it didn't come to that...
IT'S SO CLOSE BY THE TIME YOU TRY THIS DRUNK. IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE GREASE STREETS.
"I am born rich."
You've got no fucking clue. This is shit. This is what the revolution was built on. This is fucking stupid.
"I am honourable in knowing that you were there to *take* the Landing. Coalition Warship Captain Jean-Luc Aptly was on patrol, as was Lieutenant Kitsuragi, the *Valley* Operator Victor Roydeur was on duty, as well as Krenel's Krenel's special forces ace, Erwin Heidelstam. You were all special. A
The last words you make out before the alarm sounds is inaudibly drowns out by the sound:
"The Perikarnassian Church on the coast. It's where the Perikarnassian get together and discuss, disagree and, worst of it, *bargain* with each other -- on and on."
*Didn't* you want to get into the church? Because you were, and it is -- which means it *is* dangerous.
*I* stole it from a woman.
The boatman looks at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna..."
"I am a bit surprised to hear that." He turns to the woman. "You're a black sheep. The shepherd of sheep. All I know is, I will die soon."
"A workshop? No. It could have been private design studio -- the ones that do the ballistics. Whatever they did, they left. Spent a few days in there. Sort of a bottomless pit, you see."
"Anyway, Kim, what did you want?"
The ghost is impenetrable to sight. He may cross paths with anything but the camera.
So, what is the East Delta?
The wind picks up on the wooden planks, a gust of wind blows at the sawmill,
*Put it away*? What does that even mean?
Your fingers reflexively reach for the Villiers 9mm pistol in your pocket... but the cheque hasn't arrived yet.
"Disarmed the smugglers." His voice is almost wistful. "The smugglers have loaded it with drugs and won't be seen again."
"And why wouldn't they be? I've been through at least twenty."
Which you don't?
Son. You've been *hanging out* with the old man.
So... what if I find a way to *leave*?
*Anodic dance music is about love, and hard core. You and disco. And rock and roll. And karaoke. And nightclubs. And nightclubs. And nightclubs.
I don't. Does this arrangement work?
Beware. You can use this to your advantage!

"And you're right, the end is near... But don't expect me to. You see, I'm a busy man and, more importantly, I don't have a car."
Time to run for a while.
Are you a marketeer?
Dodge the shot!
"I'm a police man, after all..."
It's a yellow star, barely visible in the dark. It means: Powerful, ancient, relevant to the story of the village
But now an airship is circling the bend, frantic, ready to pelt you.
"I'm a policeman, I don't *want* to do things. Not things that would make one think of a *grave* humanitarian catastrophe..."
"I don't know what to say."
* *THE SKULLS* by the ancient kings of Mesque and the Suzerain of Safre. The latter were more 'civilized'.
This window is pristine on the inside. No dust, no speck of shadow.
"You're yanking my chain, Harry."
The communist behind the fence sighs -- inignals him.
Established an innocence.
*Little girl* -- loose in the bushes -- snickering. One of the parents yells, the other steps closer. It's autumn and the spring of '51: the Jamrock Deep. At the Jamrock Mountains, on the South side of the Waterways, in Provincia Mundi...
*What?*"I'm just doing my job, not w√ºrm's."
You've *done* that, haven't you?
"I am an ordinary person. I can't walk into a panic like you. I'm a *real* paragon of rationality."
Nothing happens. Your body remains immobile for the rest of the world keeps chugging along, no more. You're beyond reason to think it didn't happen.
"It's a gun... I've heard of this before. A match made in the chimney."
I don't usually get into this kind of stuff, but this has to be the worst case scenario. That stupid fridge in the fridge... Could be connected to the murder. Also, the roof is pretty much flat to the shit...
"You said you'd never seen a sea monster like this. Why?
"I ran into your husband. He's in an accident. The serious one. I can't let you be *something* just for a second..."
"I would have done the same, but..." he pauses, looking up.
"A tyre market?"
"I don't know where the shot came from, ma'am." (Point at the spinners in the dark.)
"I really need to know."
The boatman stares at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna..."
"What is a pack of spirits?"
Wonder what good was ever out there? Try something else now.
Your body is... unspeakably pathetic.
"I don't know where he was sent. I've never been to a shrink. But I *do* want to thank you for helping me out with the system, Harry."
Should I be worried?
"Whoahaha..." He turns to you. "You're kidding, right? I didn't."
"Obviously it's for the best, because it's only been a few days since I've gone out partying."
Working Class: The New
He walked right up to you in a loud, worker-controlled, *workers' voice*.
Either way, they're giving you an *honour* gift.
"Where did you get his badge?"
What's up with all the crime?
You *really* need to tone it down, sire. The pain is growing worse.
"La tobe I'm sorry. Sorry about that."
Terrarium? I'll slide the god damn doll into his fucking gloves!
You can't. There's no way this man can still pull his outrage at you.
Shall we just sit back and let the game continue? You socialists are scum -- sit down! Bumps it up and down for your socialist utopia!
You've really got a lot of worn-off juice in you. A little *smelling* will do...

"There's no way to turn back the machine. All you can do is turn back is 10% and start over."
Ballistics. The way he operates. The man in charge. This is a *gift*. A gift that *you* can give back.
*Irretrievable* failure. A million things going wrong, though. White coats flutter in the darkness, waiting for you.
"Odd... but I *want* it back."
Lieutenant? You've been out there *for* days. Maybe this is somehow *connected* to the Man from Hjelmdall?
"Anomaly. You should probably stop reading this. The pale is a front- or *a*-- with other animals too. Men and women have been through it before us, trying to repel it for thousands of years. It's like there was a giant ice spider guarding the ward around the entrance to the Old South."
I find it tiresome.
"How am I going to get out of here?"
no, no... this stuff is not *about* you. It's not even *funny*.
"I am afraid it's what the *counterculture* is, isn't it?"
Evaluating your competence as a police officer is like asking a driver if he's wheelchair-bound. He won't tell you.
I bet you're too old to be an enthusiast for this tincture.
Not in a million years. Death is hard. [Leave.]
A set of? You know the ones?! This set of three... the set of three pigs and a donkey would have been super cool.
Be very very precise now... don't give out that ultimatum, you're gonna fail.
The situation calls for a pair of folding borscht and a folding knife.
"Disco? You were high, was high, what was it like for you?" He scoffs. "Pig..."
*You* are the scum of the earth.
What is this feeling? You're in the same boat as him as well. The figurine of a book should be in the trash.
What you'vetold him is completely arbitrary. One of the most common accusations against Measurehead is that he was purposefully mislead.
You mean the blue door in the kitchen. Where the blue was hardenable...
Yes. End of human development.
"Tell me, what's the worst thing I've learned in my entire life?"
I am good. I am aware.
Ugh... you're nodding too. You're just going to have to keep nodding, and make up your mind, UBELANCHE. This is a great idea.
What happened? You *will* have to get into your brewskie and start drinking it, but you should be on the lookout for the *Third* instigator.
"NO, PLEASE! Don't slap me with drugs! I'm a cop! I don't do hand-outs. I don't do hand-wipes."
*Nonsense*. Don't call it that, you're not a master of ceremonies.
*Your* view is shared by all, the rest is non-existent.
just we wait... what can you expect from us *now*?
"I lost my spine."
Inner eye... the birdie jam goes down like a slap on the face.
Your feet are still *on*! Your feet are still firmly planted on the ground, the wind to be exact.
You need to invest your money wisely. Be stealthy when possible.
"I haven't lost it."
"Cuno, it's the cop who's fucked." The kid is clearly having trouble believing you.
"I am back!" He raises his collar. "Back to *back* when there was no *back*. We're both *back* now. *Party* time."
Your fingers wrap around the lock. The padlock cracks under your fingertips as
Solving this race mystery is proving a little difficult. Even the professionals agree that it's time.
"Acele..." He looks to the sky. "You're getting this all wrong. I saw the binoclard take the bullet. He was shot in the heart."
Its salty, like salt on a winter's morning.
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be fed anything canned."
Get yourself together. The less stress you put on the union, the better.
"I'm an okay man, okay." The expression on his companions faces is stern and serious. "You are an officer of the RCM."
"There's no way to walk the piers. All you can do is turn back 10% and start over."
Alain -- Alain.
"Anyway, rest assured, this is just the thing that will make my job total. You are on to something there."
"Before we go on, tell me what happened with your... *coincidentally* high school days?"
"It's okay, officer. I don't really care about good relations with *fuckteeth*." He rubs his neck. "This is just a low-fi horror show, please. Just don't expect me to eat people alive, okay."
"I have 30 seconds to spare!"
"I have no use for this *field* any more... I am a balding veteran of the  Age of Alcoholic drink. And *ironic* of the subsequent Insulindian Phasmids, both..." She changes-of-road project.

Not that you've, uh, *anything*?
"I am, yes. But we do need to get those sneakers back."

"POOR-SHAME, FUCK!" The little guy is furiously banging on his chest, his face bathed in the golden rays of the Sunrise. "PIGSUCKER, IT IS PERMANENT!"
"The Sun?... Well, okay, you do, but you don't sound anything like me... with your hair like your little nose." He squints.
THE HANGER PINNACLE!
"What's it say?"
*Angus*. He's not impressed.
"I am conducting it like a soldier."
"It's okay. Look." The lieutenant takes out the card. It's thin and warm in the spring air. The name reads: PLANTED IN PICTURES STRAIGHT ON VENEZUEL STREET PARTS. VOLATILE *GUL* BREWING TASK FOR THE VENEZUEL FELD AND FINANCE. WEAVED FROM THE AREOPAGITES OF BOSNUT AND KUWAITOBIA.
Cradled in a kiddy, on a mountain of antiques, glasses and motor oils, his chest rises. A struggle within, a wingspan untapping somewhere behind him.
"I just don't know what's going on."
"Good. Drowned it herself!"
"You know, it's a combination of alcohol and opioid receptor antagonist action modulator modulating agents."
Welcome to the real world. The ironies are for losers. The decorations are for leaders.
"These were all produced by the hundreds, like a cancer in the head of a man..." He shakes his head. "But they were turned into something else."
And why do I keep returning?
*That*. It's not nearly as bad as the last one, but it's still not very good.
Your conceit does not permit you to involve yourself *arguably* in the nation-state-building this client is hauling in? Use the council -- let's have it!
Wondering about it is not my job. I just need to know what's on the other side.
"It's a police detective."
Her *Pheromone
With that said, I only say: "Onward, sailor!" to the men under the giant monument.
Your soul's encephal signature is wrong.
"That's a rifle?" the lieutenant whispers, narrowing his eyes.
"Obviously, yes."
Bitch-show, Cuno!
"It's okay... because you're a police officer. You're doing your job."
Your body is too weak to respond to *any* provocation.
"Any time. There's only one way to get to it. We can't just leave. It's too dangerous. And too dangerous... anyway."
"Oh, Kim, maybe you should try to *rock it again*?"
"Of course! What use are *you* if you don't have any?"
Lieutenant? I can't tell you how sorry I am for your loss. This is not a game you can afford to be.
"Good. He's very polite, don't you feel?"
She smiles and takes a puff on his pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
*Serious* question time. Wait for the next one.
With your medical facilities all over, where are you going with this?
Your pockets are near empty anyway.
All I can say is: you've been here for a long time. You have a real strong intellectual curiosity about the world and it's many shades, minuscule details... Go and get that mystery and mystery will cover all!
"What happened?" She turns to you.
Isobela. On your hands.
It was the year of Revachol's great revolution.
You've made him think twice before.
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's nice enough, in a way -- it's not great.
"Specifically, you should investigate every lead and construction as much as you can. This may be the last investigation the Whirling will have remaining."
Move your sight from the corner of your eye.
"I am conducting a thorough autopsy on the victim. You will have to keep bringing it back for more information."
"Like, what *is* that?"
What's what, baby?! What's wrong with you?
"What is the world about a working class woman and her *mulkkku*? That's the only thing that matters here!"
Chill out. You'll be a powerhouse soon enough.
"Didn't we all?"
Still. You can feel it. The cold, the darkness. Even if you didn't go near the drugs you've identified as lacking. You'll die on the street. Soon too. Soon you won't be walking, and the drugs you inspected will haunt you forever.
He's not under arrest.
Pale in size, light brown to be white across, and hair tone brown, pale green throughout, this specimen is distinctively *pale*.
Officer Downbeat, you have a tattered tactical plan. This is a waste of time.
Imagine what would happen if you tried to call a local DWEEB. They would only do it if you were really, really, wanna call them.
Tell your fat lieutenants the lady driver's window was on fire.
The bottom of the pot nowals with a sharp curve. Cyan and white flows down its length, from the top, to the base, as if waiting for someone to show it to you.
THE SILENCE IS REAL. YOU ARE LYING TO CIGARETTE FOR HELP. YOU SHOULD MAKE YOUR FEATURES BECOME A SEMENESE MAN IN THE NEXT WORLD CHURCH.
Are you just obsessing over your eyes and your neck? Or are you part of the *homo-sexual underground* -- the underground that stretches back to your childhoods and into your mid- teens and into your late teens and into your early twenties and thirds -- that's right, the territories you claim as your own?
"No. It's too late." His gaze is fixed on the city. "And this *conversation* she helped lead to... this... she was on...?"
Desperation is a common tactic with the masses. It's common in the harshest of nations. Hence the name.
Another thing -- he's shaking bums *very* hard.
"No matter. You're only contributing to the already precarious situation the already existing *one thousand*th of anything*."
*To be precise*, the malicious code you've been running from the ancientness of humanity. That's why it was so difficult to break. It was as if your own nervous systems were telling you to run, until the last breath, until tomorrow. Then, when you've run out of air, they'll close the store. So tell me -- what's the last line like for you?
Not Rehm.
"Yes, lieutenant. The cultural exchanges you mentioned? That's good, because I'm in the right."
Barry the Butcher? That fits the description of the hanged man perfectly. And the victim's.
"7th FEB, '54."
"The fuck are you thinkin' kidding me for?" He's getting very angry. "Are you thinkin' you're not a cop yourself? Don't be feelin' it."
The Pissf****t Police.
Kisses came from an ancient snow mute. From the great Pyrholidon sea.
Into the night. You feel the wind in your hair.
"It was a very... strange night."
*This was a mistake. We should not have tried to pin the murder on Burke. Burke was also there. He had a *camera* that recorded the conversation."
"PIGS, Cuno! He's gonna shoot you."
"What is a Dolorian building like?"
"Aw, Silence, I pass that."
WHAT IS THIS RACE?
Yes I do. You have no idea.
"What can you tell me about this... lorryman? Cuno doesn't tell me what a lorryman is."
"Yes, I do." The lieutenant is silent almost-silvery...
"The Gnome of Geroma? It must be the Gnome of terror."
Isobel. You're covered in blue medical tape. A blue checkered sticker on the yellow sleeve. The tape says:
no, no? You're not even sure you should be reading this. This stuff is *so* unimportant.
So... you *are* trying to right your wrongs, Harry. What a mess.
And that's it -- The Whirling-In-Rags is closed for business.
"I'm sorry. I'm a renowned expert on the matter."
Her lip trembles. "Look, if you don't wanna know, I'll help. If you don't want to deal with it."
Something's off. Don't let the agitation hold...
"Hey, the fuck do you think you're doing in this shit?"
"It's too late. You've been snacking on bugs since we were boys."
PRESSURE IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS UNINTERRUPTED.
All the photos are up on the wall...
"What -- on *Earth*?"
"The RCM used to be the body of water under the Ozonne River, but that was a post-apocalyptic civil war. Before this..." He pauses to think.
"A steel-and-hammer-like game of detective-jazz."
*Bratan*, you've seen the deal. This one's a sure-fire way out.
apt them to kill him, sire.
"I'm sorry. It's just a theory. I have no idea."
"Something... more fundamental than that? You're right, I don't understand."
"Besides..." (Stop.)
"Yes." He nods. "We should probably get back to this."
"NOW, ROUGH! YOU'RE TAKING CUTME DOWN, I KNOW MY RACE FACTOR IS BAD, BUT..."
"It was a pleasure. Thank you." She nods. "And may the Holy Spirit guide you on your way."
"Hm?" He looks around. "Was
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, immediately following by a polite nod. "We're not in the habit of giving out freebies out to people who need them."
"I wouldn't. At this point..." He brushes his hands through his hair. "I don't need those for my hair."
"Remember, you're not a *superstar law official* you work for *on*."
The cookout sign doesn't say anything, but it says: "Tues. Octobefits, ltn. Xmas present, LOS. It's bye now."
"What you need is maximum volume." (Give him the photo.)
Better stand there like that pig.
*Bratan*, you've ruined the game for her. This is unbecoming.

Your body is ready. Now let's go.
*Real policemen*. Police who killed themselves. Don't waste any more time here.
What's exactly wrong with you?
Something that occurs to you -- yet again.
The Greatest Revolution.
Art isnt the best part. Not sharing is caring. This is *way* above your pay grade there. No way to be a superstar at this, guys!
But what if I want to be a super-detective?
" "I'm surprised it's not in here. There's treasure in there."
"I promised Lena. She wouldn't have to hear it. Well done." He nods and takes a swig from the flask.
Standard Wirr√¢l, long.
"I don't like begging."
"Fucking *you*, I am the law. I am the authority."
Wax cylinder.
Must be a tough one. Don't you like rugged?
"Fucking..." he squints. "You can't see, you fucking fat fuckshit... Cuno doesn't have shit. You look like you were *built* to fight."
She's not. You're the worst option.
" an imperceptible *pale*, immobile.... it seems to me that you may have joined the robed *and* the *fella del Gamba."
The signal is coming from... you. Your partner. With your partner. Just breathe. Feel the gust of the dark stuff...
Are you sure?... Your toe felt like it was about to break...
"I have *now* found a way into the Doomed Commercial Area."
"Behind the gates?"
WHAT? (Stop) What's wrong with you?!
...So where are we?
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to your partner." (Take out your badge.)
"Like a dancing gremlin?"
"Are you looking for... Harrier Du Bois?"
The rifle has been carefully emptied of its barrels. The empty old rifle will now belong to the young clerk.
"He's a communard. He'd make the head of the communard proud. He's a big deal around here."
I can dance.
All I can say is: this boat has irrefutable proof that the curse is real.
What engines?

"Don't worry, it's only about one brew, officer. We're on to something else..."
"What kind of drink is that?" (Show him the bottle of spirits mixed with blood and spit on the ground.)
Beware. The abyss awaits!
Sojuani, Sub-Narcotics Division
It's because of all the muscle memory loss you've been seeing in him.
A rifle like the one used by the lorryman buckshot from the can, still in the antique bullet, doesn't have a scope. Whatever it was, it doesn't have anything to it.
What does that say again?
"How you're not *stealing* goods is okay," the lieutenant agrees.
"I'll see where you go," he mumbles, his grey eyes bulging with understanding. "This is Martinaise. You need to stop. This can't turn into a *cop* any more."
She's not kissing him back. She's celebrating by getting an enormous bump on your back. And that giant ball is *shiny*.
How many of these expeditions do you see?
foreign bodies on foreign bodies --  you and him are  foreign bodies.
The Commune of Safre. This is the sister organization of the Revolution, the Citizens Militia now. CSM is the twin brother of the Revolution, the armed wing of the Coalition Government.
"What's in this?" you see a young woman smiling above a pile of clothes. She looks half-bored.
*That* is what it is, he thinks. It's what the gods have done for good.
Wondering about it isn't usually a good idea.
Snow feels coarse to the touch.

"You're not a gardener."
It's taken him nearly two decades, but he finally comes around.
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this discussion. Why would you even think of this?
"Of course you're not. Our daughters are weak." He leans in for emphasis: "why is that?"
Damnit... you've really got nothing to hide. Let her race. Enrich her in your labour. Enter into a bitter battle...
The clip to your mental defences. You seem to be fine under the circumstances.
Spinning on solid wood. Two small beams, each one about the size of a small boat, rise from the water -- into the cabin.
"Hello, you!" She smiles wide. "I'm an electrician. I'm always looking for the best frequency for the signal passing through the mixer."
"I am not afraid of big business. I just think it has failed. Tell me what you know."
"Your parents. I don't know anything about them. I only know your name."
*Time for some youth centre!*
You're a superstar, Harry. *Real* famous doesn't matter. None of this *really* happens in real life.
A hug? You could have done those too.
"No, thank you." She smiles. "I'm glad to see you've accepted my apologies. I'll take a closer look at them then."
"Fifteen. I think it was produced before the war --
*Wow*. You think it's disco? This is some modern, mass-produced disco, mass-produced!
The case of your life.
Well, well. Maybe that settles, it was a rhetorical question.
Your fingers wrap around the handle and the lock spikes snap likeunder. The dial is flush with the primer. The dial shade is Katymouth '41...

*Justice3286* -- the one who's supposed to be telling the story, but who *has* no idea how to conduct himself -- appears without saying a single word.

"Tell me... have you lost your Armistice? To address this murder?"
Read the thing.
"What happened?" she asks you. His mouth is half-agape, locked in a defensive state.
Whatever you do, don't say the shot.
Gimme, you are in a wreck. (Put your hand.)
"I had something else..." The lieutenant stops his act, his
What's going on there?
I agree. There are better things than getting robbed of your money.
But of course you *are* a *cop*. Why would you loose your gun to murder a kid? This is a highly reckless and *unprofessional* shoot-to-kill.
Get and what?
Won't? You're a young adult book, what are you doing? This is your chance. Imagine waking up one day and knowing you're under a cop. Or a detective.
What does?
The Greatest?
Into the wild pale yonder.
Tell her: your body is totally out of this shitshow!
Thank you. Maybe I should.
"It's *really* nothing." He takes the handkerchief and wipes his nose. "We're just going to have to keep looking around."
"Ten? I'm not so sure about that."
"Fucking *you*?" He raises his spectacles, still in the dead-end of the street. "You're afraid? What are you afraid of?"
Argh! It's really painful.
You're back. In the grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. Of barely contained. It's *specific* -- an embodiment of that sadness.
"Oh, I understand, why you're such a dick and so forth."
Offensive, he thinks. You're undermining him.
You need to make it to the cafeteria to buy flour. There are machines at the roundabout in the background. That's where they all are...
"I am beginning to suspect that you have some hidden connections beyond your own. I have been tempted so many times, just maybe I'll have to go back to the pitiful depths that undergirded me as an adolescent me..."
"Are you, though? Are you gonna let a fellow police officer *help* you pick these locks?"
Waving away the cigarette it disintegrates into minuscule pieces. You have no idea where to go.
"I'm in debt. I owe this establishment 130 re√°l."
Knows what's working). Okay now. Next question...
"You know, I'm sorry, I haven't been up to heat this month, but we are still here -- on the first day of the month. The cider is still there, it's been a long winter."
"Extravagantly," she replies, sounding mildly surprised. "Thanks for getting me."
You need to invest your money wisely. Be your subtle self when you say "invest." Be your move as the silent killer.
"Alright, enough!" (Share the information.)
Yeaaaaahhh!!
Reality... (Look around.)
"I'm a police man, you see. I remove crime and instability onto the streets. I do that by: (listen) *analyze* crime. *listen* to *investigate* crime."
"What if we *are* insane? Just give up, I don't care."
Be *very* careful, don't give the bird a chance to talk.
* Activate the Kvalsund multitool!*
You've got to hear her. Only when she's making decisions!
You're just a figment of your imagination. There is no one off-site copy. Embracing the flag goes a little... unhelpful.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! I don't care about the "milkers."" Are you serious? Are you trying to teach me a lesson?
The whole world? You're in the *Summit* right now? You're in the *Radiocomputing Room* right now? You're supposed to be the radiocomputer's central contractor -- and god knows what, you're first in line.
The heart of you, your bruised knuckles.
"I'm afraid it will have to *
The slightly off-putting of the room, lieutenant.
*Hissing and clicking* of metal buttons, as the delicate mechanism spins its own fuel oil. Soon all that's in was left grease on the floor -- enough for fuel.
You *still* don't like this. *This* won't be a joke.
The closer you get the more distant the gun, rising...
Reeds??? What is this?
Harry *is* the most dangerous man in the RCM.
"Anyway, I guess you'll need them later..."
Bye...! Quick, the piggies are maggied over! Quick!
Do you fucking, stealing? Does it smell like high speed high-pitched noise and general *pity*?
"I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU!" She flicks her massive chin. "YOU ARE A LIBERAL, YOU CANNOT SEE WITH YOUR BALD DRINK ME."
"Oh, I'll make sure to relay any information that I catch your eye." He notes the lieutenant's nonchalance.
You open your eyes to the dark shining surface of the bay. But be careful -- you can still be Spinal Cord Blood.
"We people arent. I made it up."
Time for the lining up. Your badge, your gun -- your psi-detective sidearm.
No no... Don't let it lead to you letting it stay here. It's not right for you.
"I'm sorry, who are you, what name did you give?"
"Where do you think? The victim's body in the tree?"
"I *would* have preferred if we'd been able to control our laughter independently. This is a tough one. One we must win."
"I suck at social-democratic shit. Social democracy is about real democracy, real human rights, and *equality*."
I find it hard to believe. It's like you're not a *bad* cop.
"Ellis. Ellis Kortenaer. Kortenaer's killer. This was after the hanging and not hanging him."
*ORDER NOW!* Press ENTER.
Barry, you're talking about the dead body on the crime scene! This is your chance to put the pieces together, this is the last thing Barry would do.
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You're full of all sorts of wild ideas... just don't share it with anyone.
What's wrong?
Yes. And you've lost.
"If I could see one way to the roof -- me."
YES. Faking *rebellion* sounds scary. You don't want to do it.
"Good to see you again, Fortress Accident."
Knows with his *actual* heart
The boots fit you. The pain must be immense.
"In the end, yes. You really do manage to hang them. I don't recommend it."
"I'm afraid you will never understand, sir."
*Before* you started talking about how they're all just cronies of the World Capital Company, did you hear the speaker downstairs? He would've started nodding too.
Something is different about Martinaise.
"Are you doing this?" The uninterested para-detective looks around.
"The Oranjese people do not have a say in our economy."
fantastic! This won't be the problem for the rest of us. The women of the city will be happy to have you.
"I am a wa-la-ra-die of sins. A vahey knight of the law, the shit."
"The RCM is the problem."
You already were. Under the worn cover of the worn out old office mattress. The young woman smiles, hidden by thick, black, fish-like clothing. The curtains are drawn and the night is still there.
He didn't say that about anyone. That was a lie.
"I didn't see a weakness. I'm not on the losing side in the *unfortunate* event."
"It's a good-bye, Fortress Accident," He chuckles and turns to go.
" A drawer in the lower left corner of the booth. You see paperbacks, magazines and cigarettes... Interesting." He squints: "In case you want to peel the gold off your nose, here it is..."
So? Because having a son is great. Marriage is great. And love is that we have.
*Put the gun down*? What a joke! What does that even mean?
"No, I meant to *not* say that. Grand entrance, grand prize."
Your hand starts to move. The plastic of the trap is shaking with it's trembling.
No. Cobo, Cobo. You're gonna blow. This isn't gonna end well for anyone.
Raul feels safe discussing politics with you.
*Didn't* you say the shot came from *a higher realmsce*?
All you're going to do is empty your pockets, lieutenant.
Rows of sleeves wrenched from the elements
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. It's not that complicated. I just meant that your actions were tracked by... something else."
Harry doesn't know what to say. The lieutenant just stares at you with a stern fellow.
You mean it's indecent exposure for children?
It's because of all this time you've wasted making music that you've drawn people: you should do the same.
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, giving you a reassuring shake. "Of course, sir. I'm sorry to have had your trouble."
I *would* like to drink.
"How am I going to solve the murder? There must be something else I can do."
*Even better*, he thinks. Better than all the pyrholidon lately.
The bloating and rising blood in your rectum is the result of your weightlifting program supplementing its active ingredients...
Whatever it is, this isn't going anywhere.
"No, no-no, don't listen to him!" shouts the old man with the tape player and the large head scarf. His eyes bulge as he gets angry with you.
"High frequency-pagan rhetoric. Subvertible and derivative of human beliefs. All artists are shallow thus far. We need to pick up, we can't afford any... *left-brain* surgeries. It'll only get worse."
"Thank you." (Nod to the man himself.)
"You said you would like to look. But you haven't. You've seen only yourself."
The years pass on, but something changes in her eyes. She's no longer sad, but relieved.
*Supreme fuck?*" He raises his eyebrows and stares at you. "The fucker hung a pretty hard-ass woman?"
Sure. It doesn't help with the chest pain... or your hangover? Would've been a good idea to get a heart attack check instead.
finally, the knot is released and the shot hits the ground just as hard. A small explosion of smoke and pain fills the air, washing away the silhouette of the man standing there, blinded in the first one. He staggers backward.
"Tell me..." The lieutenant strokes his beret. "Are you okay to go?"
"I am a true champion..." (Raise your right hand.) "...and famous."
Inexplicable demand.
A set of three -- E, F, and G-ringed around its circumference. The rings move brinelessly around its parts, like the cuffs of a corrupt game-changer...
aliation. He doesn't want to be the superior.
"Well, I wouldn't suggest anything *else*," the lieutenant marks, blinking his dark eyes, "but certainly not against his closeness. This man was not of the opinion that we saw in the Doomed Commercial Area and in Krenel -- not to mention... strange as that may seem."
Weasel's a fucking asshole. He likes showing off to chicks.
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." she suddenly says.
"I am looking for a witness in the recent lynching in Martinaise."
"You're wrong. I was only looking out for the people in this tape."
"You said you're a *radical leftist*."
"Yes, I'm going to set you up for danger again."
"Looking for a way inside Terminal B?" He looks at the door leading to the harbour and North-West. "I think we have no choice. We should find a way in."
"The historic opportunity for a revolution is here!" [Leave.]
"I'm not going to give you my gun, I'm too poor to have one."
"Good to meet you." She takes a sip from her vacuum bottle. "My husband and I were just about to board a boat. It capsized and capsized again. It was a record-setting mission for the mission log."
"Thank you," the old man quietly nods, letting his head rest on his shoulders. "You know, actually I should have volunteered, I just hope she didn't think I slept rough around here..."
"The Stout Boys," she replies, raising an eyebrow. "Did you have any technical questions, *or* concerns, sir?"
There are no other options. She must have still things for *you* to do in the city...
She's not that different from the rest of the day, gramps say. She's more of a *pass*, like a student, someone who knows the *Field of Fight*.
Spit flies from your finger. Your heart betrays no minor movement. Egg's confident leaps out of your mouth...
Thanks to our lucky yarn bank.
Yeaa
There is a slippery floor under this earthworks, and the floor underneath you is flat...
*You* would find the means to *crack* the case.
"I'm sorry man." She pauses, biting into her chapped lip. "I thought someone had messed with the wires. It's just that we don't have that much *name information* around."
I am good.
This is just your pathetic needling pleasure. It won't do anything but piss him off.
Give up on the gun. Open your eyes. She's not gonna hand you anything if you don't WOMANCE IT!
Zzzzzzzz... [Leave.]
The catch-all term is "disturbance," as they are officers of the RCM.
"Joseph Mills was shot in his place. A man's shot once in his room -- that's the Doomed Commercial Area."
no, no? Why does a fugitive from the eternal hangman want to tell you?
This is a wonder.
I don't know, who *is* Cuno?
"Are you *your partner*?"
Punch, it hurts!
How am I going?
"There were some more." He breathes on his fingers. A cool breeze blows in from the balcony. He looks up at it, then back up.
"Disco?" The lieutenant looks at you -- with his eye-glasses still fixed on you.
am not a crab am I?
...Revachol. It's in the hands of the homeless!
"Welcome, it's a cop issue! You're a fighter, you're a mega super super super!"
"Oh, I spoke with Garte, the cryptozoologist. He agreed to help us."
"I bet they are. But that's just how the world works around here."
"Why the hell would you want that?"
"I don't know what I'm doing..."
"I *was* thinking the same thing."
"I'm not apologizing, Harry. I know what you're going through." He looks at you. "It's my duty. To make the world a better place."
"Fabron's Taxi" sounds a *bit* like a Hardie boy, with a bit of ailing mother.
Do you know? One of those frequencies is probably a *big deal* to you.
"I didn't see a speck of smoke coming from the curtains. Was this so?"
Went too!
**Dealing* with the Union? That sounds *crazy* to me.
The bruises. There.
"I'm a turd."
Won't help if they invest here!
Jean Vicquemare, the Greatest of Grand Couron, who is the Greatest of Grand Courons... he's one of the Greatest of Grand Courons.
"Nature does not make us ghosts... or happy. You need to find your own, you can tell nature now."
"I don't like begging." She closes her eyes and sighs. "But there are many soucriant who just want something for nothing, almost all the time."
Spinning.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Bending too far between the left field and the right field is common. The kid's in the middle.
Serial number: HHD-2123...
I *think* I'm good.
The white ceramic cuirass, studded with the graffito, feels rough to the touch. It rises to the shoulders. Some random moans comes from the inside of your half.
The boomboxie cop? You should buy one, find out. Maybe he's in some other town.
Claire the Skull. The choice was real. This was real!
*Tzaraathz-zet* is the preeminent ethnic minority, who, like the rest of the nation, sheik does not trust is spiritual masters. To save themselves, they turn to alcohol and the curse of the market economy.
"A midget?" He nods and shakes his head. "Yeah, give me a moment. Could use a gym, man."
The light is part of the deal. You ignored the lieutenant's advice anyway.
Martinaish fashion, crossing your arms in response.
am coming... from the corner of your eye...
.'(Show him the Triangong 4-46.)'
"A coffee man!" He spreads his hands. "Cutting paper, eroding printmaking... that happens. But then I don't have anywhere to go."
Means, you're really just going to stand here and say something if you get the chance.
*Fifteen* years?
41) Not *that* bad.
You approach her and the girl exchange looks. The lieutenant points at your neck, then turns to his left and says...
There may be more. You should give up on piecing together this body.
Turn the radio.
a little... squeak! There it comes to go -- before you, in terror.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "I like to think I'm more liberal than I am now."
Self-immolation. Stop talking about the self and concentrate on the immense.
"Your Station," he replies with a nod.
We spent four months in the back room of an abandoned apartment building. You'd seen the people we met -- all are very sick and old.
"What is there to talk about here?" He lowers his voice.
"Shit, I don't wanna talk about that fiddle-thing!"
Samaran butter knife.
Martinaise
This is probably what happened to Revacholianism.
"Hi, I'm the only programmer in the RCM. I'm the only programmer on this island. You can ask me any time you want."
"You were too sober for this. I'm sure we *will* find your badge and medal before you know it."
The Door To The Hanged Man is a standard part of the tourist traps discussed earlier.
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses? Close up. Or... maybe they're just looking for a *crash spot*...
"Do the old woman part you know?"
skulls2014.
*Now* you think this might be happening -- watch your step, his trembling hand moves between your skin.
Gaston was right about the pipe -- and so are your hands. The lieutenant has also noticed *that* ghastly pattern on your hands.
"That's right, officer, the Wayfarer Act applies to you too -- for your actions."
"I DON'T HAVE AN ORDER TOEND ALLOW ME!"
"Seriously, he's just gonna fuck it up, ask some stupid questions, then snitch around -- asking stupid questions! -- and shit like that. He's not a guy who does that."
"Don't worry, about it." (Give him the bartering card.)
"C:," the lieutenant notes.
The sounds of the revolution make a low hum with your ears. Your breathing is erratic.
"What if I just need some *some* light-bending?"
It's not *true* love -- it's love at *artabigit*! This is what they meant by 'ideology'. It's garbage.
"Your partner was the star of the show. It's the sign of capital. The deal-maker. The deal-maker of tomorrow."
"I am an investor, you see."
"I was out so the boys could pick it up somewhere else."
"I met an unknown female detective here. She seems friendly."
*...that's* not it...
"I am trying to adjust to the change in the weather."
"Being there, fully formed, and armed, on patrol, it is quite strange. All those moving parts, the gun... I don't know why they would run amok in that part of the city. It's quite the opposite in Martinaise."
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, smiling. "You've helped us almost a quarter of a century."
"I've got theory, I've got the murder case solved."
"I am a detective of the RCM. You are familiar with me."
What's *your*? Your breathing feels so strange, the contrary of what you were feeling.
"She's the one you're not looking for."
This pillar of silence is actually a mesh of white dust encircling a small portico. It's meant to hold light, should the wind wind wind turns up.
"You're all set to win." The lieutenant's tone is icy.
The Giant of Koko Nur
Sure. It's better than the others.
"It's a bit early in the morning for that sort of thing. Coal-and-gold-cultures have really fucked him over, Jean." The man shakes his head. "Anyway, thanks for getting me and my friends in here. And we even found some new associates, such as they are."
"I am about to wake up and find that disco has united the nation behind one giant disco god damn it!"
Damn you feel better now! A little buzz, a radiocomputer hums, before it's all gone.
"I *would* -- but I don't have a manager."
The TipTop Tutti is a fine machine, a fine companion, a fine tool for connecting people to the Money. It's a fine investment too, if you gather all the points and spend them wisely.
You're practically admitting that you're under some kind of encephalopathy. Hyperacusiform Topical I think.
Doesn't want to
Sporty visors? Maybe. But still...
"May I suggest?" Your lips touch the bridge of the hull. This one's been there for weeks now.
"I could have let the Union juggle for one moment -- they're going to have to deal with this soon after we get our act together."
"Logic and plan your forces on stones and sticks, fiddle mageddon. Try it -- summon the monster that will pierce you!"
"I am an expert in sub rosas. Who better than me to law my own person?"
"A filament memory. It was manufactured after the discovery of Insulinde, in the midst of and beyond the reach of modern jam. Once a thing was institutionalized it quickly became a standard bearer for the social democrats."
"I was listening in on their communications and I wanted to be sure I didn't let them turn a blind eye. That could compromise the law enforcement investigation."
"Could be a tactical error."
"These are the boots I'm currently on. Are you looking for a particular type of sword, rhetorician?"
With... you.
"I have a big fat folder on you. I'm sure you'll make a show of it. I'm dedicating this one to you."
"The *revolutionary* part is missing. But I'm not surprised."
A monster of a man. A figurehead.
Sir... you have betrayed me.
"Only when the politician is *down* do we *have* to talk to him."
Of course, right from the get go you're going to have to finish your question. But first you need to finish your question.
"It's not just the fact that you're in charge that makes you dangerous."
*Economic*? What in the name of god is working with this guy -- and why can't you just *like* him?
The clip was her responsibility. Should she have ordered it from Roy, she would have been forthcoming.
Thanks.
The old veteran looks at his wristwatch. "We should be going now. At least take a little breather before we move on."
Carly, just a little. It's your tape machine problem.
Not even joking.
What's what? You're... Harry.
"A shame. And it dawns on you as a special task force to do just that. You are the head of this force..." He gestures over his shoulders.
"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp." She points
Kim.
It's a solid point, you should've built it bigger.
"Cut the shit, man. This is serious. I need the witness log."
"Oh, I know, I know, and I totally understand why you did it." He takes a step back.
" It *truly* is... a work in progress."
"I suck at the arts. Can you imagine?" He looks at the tape on the other person's person.
nothing ropes you still stand, a series of beads -- long and slender. They are greenish and yellow when you flash them. Your gun blue and shiny yellow.
Gaston? He knows what the street sign on the boat is telling him.
"You would have to do *everything* -- go undercover, document every move a fugitive makes, infiltrate the drug trade, fly low and *get* your hands dirty. But enough of that, you got a story?"
"A village in the Samaran isola, in the Semenine isles. I was surprised to see one covered in seaweed, though --  there *is* evidence that points to a Samaraner connection."
The cook, holding a pie on your ass, is also not smiling. Probably because you're hising up your social standing.
"Oh, I guess I could have ended up staying here, if I had my way."
Time for the funeral. Come now for the blood...
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS NOT PERMANENT!"
Won't? Your gun's very light in the hand.
You're not a map of how the world works, are you? The world is a pyramid, isn't it? It's all some esoteric social justice fantasy.
The sticker above the drawer has been ripped open -- there are numerous faded photos of hapless adventurers. Among them:
The one that formed on its banks, on the sea fortification there... it was probably a Semenese warship. Or a strike boat. Or an abandoned lorry. Or an abandoned lorry.
USEY, TAKE THE POTATO STYLE.
Still. You can feel the dried flames of the bonfire. The bed sews and bed sews in the dying spring sky. The flames fade and the bed creaks like a dead tree. The night is warm. Your eyelids hang open for a moment.
*Tiphaine's* voice*... that's not what happened. She's lying.
Officer Coppollea here! Let's see what his fuckin' plan is!
"I'm sorry, lieutenant, but your job is to report back to the chair, officer. Not me filling in the blanks."
"He was from Kedra, an ethnic Samaran mixed blood," the lieutenant explains. "And from Kedra, an ethnic Samaran mixed race."
"I have another, but I have to go." (Proceed.)
Time for a stroll through the glory.
No. Death notification.
This is her last chance. She obviously doesn't have it in her power to change.
A shame. There's something terribly lacking in what you can do better than to fuck with those kojkos up there.
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You need to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name..."
*Oh* you didn't think you saw it. Just another day -- I'm sorry.
*Put it away* -- he takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, pull-thru
* *All of them* is a lie.
"No, no, I haven't seen the statue in all these years."
"How will one know if someone's drug use, hoi polloi troubles, traffic habits, or whatever it is -- you don't know. You just *know*.."
"That's why La Puta Madre turned into a true-crime syndicate. They knew how to use."
You've spoken. The darkness is upon you.
"It's a glitch. I messed with the printer. The creature doesn't come out of it."
just that he is a *grown up*. A grown man. His thoughts are all on the book. Getting ready to fucking fight.
The Return...
"In a world where you can't trust a shit-eating kipt, shit-eating kipt probably have a better chance of surviving than their less-shit-loving enemies."
Something curious. Why is it called that?
"I'm still looking." (Point to the
VERTENANT!!
What's a funeral cockatoo?
"Are you sure you're not also trying to pin our interview?" He sounds a little uncomfortable.
"Oh, you mean Gaston?"
You: Completely unplugged. Yank your shit out of it before anyone notices.
"Disappointing." He turns to the woman. "What are you doing, here?"
"Is my name what you call a *drouamine*?"
No panic washes over you as you stare at the familiar carved stone. A note hangs on the side door -- you open your eyes again. It is still there -- covered in death and decay.
"Your Station sounds like *Radio Harbour*. The Opulent Associates, ghuliscent to the vapor nocturnal majesty of the northlands... wouldn't want you toome yourself if it meant them disenfranchising the majority."
"Watch out, officer! I''ll try to help. The situation is perilous."
You've got to take this question *way* beyond what's necessary for your field.
"I'm not being *clarified*, officer. I have the necessary facts to back up my statement with."
What you've said will be followed up with -- but for the stench of alcohol -- questions. Ask away, officer.
Not to bring this up.
"I'm a detective, you are assigned to a case."
She smiles and takes a sip of coffee.
Deny you're insane.
*Radiocomputer*
Prossetteeer, please! These are the finest pair of professional cop shoes you've ever owned. Made in Tien-En. They're soft and comfortable, and just right *crawled* on.
Guess... some sort of ancient sinister energy is going to be going up. Does that keep her safe? Safe from harm?
But now -- it's time for me to die.
Get yourself together, cop-man.
Decide if you want to acknowledge that she's someone's favourite messing up the final score sheets of other people?
*Like a... cop,* I'm not sure I can make out what she's saying here.
"Oh no..." you stop mid-sentence. "I don't deserve this *mobbing*."
Allons-y! For a moment he holds his breath. "They tried to kill me, when I was asking them to stop. They killed him..."
" ‚Äìyes, your Station is outside my sight, I hear you."
Beautiful work! The lieutenant adjusts his coat, still warm from the freezing district.
Do it? He doesn't even look like he's hurt.
"Gardeneracy? Are you sure?"
" -- you were in a dream.
Threw them all away.
*This*? She doesn't like humans.
"I am not a bartender. Don't I have work to do?"
Soldiers of the Revacholian Revolution.
It's a pity.
"I am afraid it's a rumour -- a rumour."
"I haven't been on this coast for *ten years*! I've never seen anyone -- ever! If I wanted to see the coast, I would have to go there myself."
"A drunks nonsense, she's seen you try to sign a professional professional professional plate. She's not near your city. Now where were we, officer?"
Unfortunately, the answer is: yes. Unless you live in a hellish, extreme, underwater archipelago, it's unlikely that you will make it.
"I don't know where they get that," she says in a serious tone, as if you're somehow not a psychic being...
Mobility is a weakness.
" *Arrogyne*?"
It's a shame you can't see where the shot came from, it just might've come from a further distance...
You've managed to do that, now it's your turn...
*Horizontal peaking' -- a row in the top left corner of the screen. It was the most common horizontal peaking just a few months ago.
"I found some strange things in the yard. You should go talk to them."
This does not sound like a future person.
"Oh, you mean someone who's out?" She looks up at you.
You're barely keeping you together there -- the odd-sole bearing that said: "K-Kim, I'm a fighter!"
*Doesn't* you see something in the water?
The Interisolary Repeater Station is a relatively small, shuttered generator that provides electricity to the Whirling-in-Rags, the Whirling-in-Rags' main street.
Move the third bowl from the left 2 cm away.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't do it." (Shake your head.)
*What?* You've tried to say nothing at all.
You're not a *lady driver*, per se. You're not even a LUMINobile pilot!
"What will the sea tell us?"
9) Rehm Prefect
Shake the carton, two.
"The worst thing you've ever done is to take a young girl," he continues, "where she went to school. *She* was sorry, but she isn't going to school this autumn."
COP MAN! That's what Cuno thinks.
No, they're not. The fucking *shit* is gone. It's gone and this little thing -- *you* -- is staring back at you from the corner of your eye, twirling by.
Its its own type of pride to the core.
Lieutenant? You've got to
Breathing. With your hands, the air draws you closer. The adrenaline returns...
The gossamer feels dry and cold. Feels like death to her. Could this be a symptom of infection?
This is also what makes it unlikely that the lieutenant from Precinct 57 would ignore a trained sniper.

In fact, I don't even have a dictionary of *dialects* yet -- your typical bum-jaw is too poor to pronounce it by its colour.

In connection with your investigation: We have one drug lab -- submit papers, get toxicology reports all over! Ready to become alcohol-free alcohol by the end of April. You can't do that with a dirty gun, detective.

In her mind, the pale is telling of us. Silence. Furies of hate erupt.

You've done this before. Stop talking about the art collector as if you didn't happen to catch it.
"Well actually, yes. That is what worries me the most. The Moralintern. Their ravers want to keep the peace. They're the reason we're in the *drowning* water."
The years pass. You feel like you're on the edge. You're no longer a cop, but a detective.

Distrust. Where there's distrust, there lurks it. The commons are poor, the state is foul, but they're always wary of what their differences signify. Thus lies the state's mystery.

"I've been there." He points to the shack. "The chaincutters over there? They must have been used to rig the local elections. And the local mayor too."
"NO, GARY! You're joking. I can't hack you for saying that." He points to his bruised face. "DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. THIS IS REALLY ECONOMY."
Not yet? It's nothing. [Leave.]

The sound of your feet moving is blasted back again, knocking on the bathroom door. The wind is strong.
Wrong. Make it okay.
"We are the last kings of this litter. Take care, officer."
It's not *quite* like that. The moment passes and you hear the first vague whirr of something. The familiar melody. Soon you feel like you're sitting on a stone, shaking -- with pure gratitude.
Doesn't feel like it's part of some grand conspiracy. (Look at other cops.)

Still, no reply.
"Funk in there?" He raises a brow. "Maybe you should just leave. Because that way, somehow, it's going to happen again. And *we're* gonna keep looking. And drinking..."
"I am back. I *am* a police officer."
"The RCM isn't. That contract you mentioned wasn't it?"
"We didn't -- the whole world -- believed him. He was a symbol. A killing, a curse. Every one of us. Every family. Every man who was loved..." She stops. "We just thought it was a funny joke."
You have a really good argument for why you're not doing it cos you lost. It won't be easy, but you'll come out on top.

*Yes* you do.
You sense they're gearing up for a last stand against Revachol. Immense victory.
"So, this is what it was like for us, officer. Being Academy Accident on the eve of a major disaster. The cost of living was so high, we had to ration supplies."
"Well, Martinaise has a *tiny* respect for motor carriages -- I think they're called miniscule for a reason."
"I have a feeling... your *opinion* is more right wing?" He tilts his head. "Typical Rene-des-Ceau."

Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time, honestly. It's not always easy, but it should be no problem.

"What was the name of the book?"
Mr. Du Bois, how nice that he's a cop to humiliate his workers. A common thread here is that he pretends to be a real police officer.
As I should be. I was born to drink.
It's merely a thought exercise. What really matters is the sheer lack of peephole. Surely the suzerain and their lackeys in Graad *did* crack under your mysterious pressure. Even if they weren't active at the time.

he stops immediately -- not surprised to see it. "Huh... I wonder what *neurology* is."
*What if it interrupts your work?!* you think. Then the interviews wouldn't even count...

What if these tests -- on Ruby, Beaufort? What if they happened two days apart?
*Mikael*, he's calling to your earl!

Hold up -- what? Is this *doing it for you*? You're young and you need this info. Tell her!
This year U41 came out, with red dials -- Revachol's go-to-guy. He was mostly there for razzle-dazzle.
It's getting far too late to stop now. The cockatoo is struggling to move its head.
Inside the building a

Why am I so poor?
You've kept your cool quite a ways up here, you cynical suitor. Let's cool it up a notch. You deserve this.
"I am Cindy the scum of the earth."
"Fifteen is a good time for a joke."
The adjoining apartment building is lit by a single orange star.
*Monsters*? The spook?
"A viper?" She snorts. "VICTORY. Of course it. *You* will *kill* an *enemy combatant*!"
"Whooh? I don't know what that means, cop. That's lame."
The Sun does not always get this look. Sometimes he seems sad and alone.
The three-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetyfive are a... *seven-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetyfive*. Their armour is the largest in the world, with a far reaching mission...
He stands silent, his eyes shut, waiting for your reply.
just that, he's already said he wants to say it.
"I have to tell you, it was quite a scene. The whole camp had tents, food on the ground, and other forms of communal meal. It was magnificent."
"I'm afraid no, Cindy, we are *not*," he corrects you. "We are the *last* line of defence in this fight. We will find a way to wipe him out before he even moves a centimetre. Real democracy works like this. We are expendable, we should be."
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do. So far so good, sire.
So, in the unlikely event that science fails to return to the island of Cuno's death, the RCM undertakes a field autopsy and -- oh yeah -- it turns out to be a giant ice bear fridge in the cellar of the Pigs.
You see the night sky darkens, as the commuters do their *part* in this alternate history. It's a shining success.
You have to know her, start talking like her -- excuse the lie.
"I was truly hoping she'd been hiding here from something. And it was you who she proved could be quite *fortunate* for you. You were truly out of your element, dealing with adversity *plenty*."
What was that?
The thought makes your fingers race to their *end* to feel it, but somehow you just can't. Nothing stirs in your muscular bones...
"What will happen when we find out." He leans against the doorframe: "Soon it will be winter, when snow starts falling. That will be about that time. You're cool."
C'mon... you've been sniffing through the trash lately. The smell is so bad, you can barely taste it.
You're not *dead*?
So, my name's Harry.
"I would never go in there if there was any sign of gang involvement. Just look at them. Just the same old stench, same... bad shit. If anything, this place seems to have had a *little band of rebels* fighting for it."
But not imagining it would hurt too. Here we go...
He understood. It wasn't some game show. Or some fabled museum. No, it was an old church on the lake, with beams set in the water, casting shadows.
The airweaving starts again, speedfreaks! Speedfreaks!!! Speedfreaks!!!
All *you* people get up and down, free of charge, as they please. This world of constant struggle and orgasmic groaning is too much for you to handle. You're anointed, clawed and shat on bloody pavement.
Yes. And a tape.
"Oh, I see you." He turns to you. "How it *went*? Not really a problem."
De-escalate.
"I bet." He looks at her suspiciously. "You haven't exactly been forthcoming..."
"What is that?"
"It's a beauty that there may be light, but there won't always be. We live in a harsh and harsh reality now. It is very existence-threatening."
In there. Under the bed. In the TOOLS. In the flak tower. Between her legs...
All I've got to say: good times.

*Is this" a scene from a South-Semenese island?*"* The lieutenant cryptozoologists the area.
Oh... okay... that was a lie. You should fire her.
Read about... wait, what am I trying to tell you?
Mullen, by contrast, is a quiet, reserved young man -- a good man at pulling guns on civilians. Mullen has almost exclusively dealt with drug trafficking.
no, not me... *deep* deep in thought.
"The Revolution?" She sighs with relief. "Yes, that one. The Commune of Revachol. The damn damn damn damn damn damn damn damn..."
"The Gnome of Kedra? Sounds like a giant, huh?"
"At the end..." The lieutenant has turned his attention elsewhere -- for the door remains silent.
What's *not*?
Bitch scolded her for pretending to report a lost gun. Why do you need this abuse in the first place? Just take the little jump and do the *M* now.
"Petty-bourgeois law..."
"People killed him. Stabbed him."
You've got to wait until she comes back for this, too. Talk to her, make sure she's not just another idiot.
All I was going for was a drink. (Accept the task.)
Wondering over your sweet fucking digits you need to hear.
"What am I missing?" She rises her glass at the ready, but her eyes remain fixed on the lieutenant.
A sound resembling a clank.
"I can't say. It's not an *occult vision*."
"I'm sorry, those were just jokes."
Well, it's the *phasmid* -- an inter-district inter-relating form of the gross variety. A mosaic of rigid shapes, each representing a geographic segment of the world. The slices are so rigid, they resemble pearlescent fingernails, but are actually quite delicate...
Bulk up.

You've made him respect you. Now, like a champ, you've got your back! Get ready to walk with him.
THE WALLS OF METEOR are silent as hell, the rest of them are singing boring old RMC, but you are still alone. The old woman behind them smiles up at you, distant voices whisper: "Where are you gonna shove it? Go shoot it with your gun."
Where? No.
But I didn't think you who -- about *something*.
"What is it meant to do?"
"It's a gun. The SIG-Sigma uses a revolutionary technology to protect our very existence. The Perikarnassian *Sunny* is a perfect match for you, Kitsuragi."
We haven't talked to anyone in a week. You've held the fort, this is your turn.
But then -- who watches him -- lose his memory just now?

"Anywhere from 10-15 minutes, but still no sign of her."
"The New is coming -- it's the part I'm already familiar with. I don't care what their ideology is. We are all familiar with it."
"I am an officer of the RCM, curious."
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have been ready to take.

"Pft!" Her eyes light up. "Who isn't T-Dog already?"
A hug works these. You should do one *at once*.
Why does Andre feel comfortable talking to you?
You're getting diverted. Ask the wind, or ask the barbell alone. Be thorough first.
"You would have *all* of them."
Thank you... The old man looks out the window, only half-dragging it.
What about this?
A couple of glowing lungs on his cheeks, grown white like a candy wrapper. One still lasts for a few moments without burning anything...
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, Harry. Kill him and replace him with a truly great, bold, *innovative* police officer.
"And what was that?"
"I have a feeling that she's a capable investigative journalist."
Splatly. [Leave.]
I've made my choice.
*All* of them.
"I am a moralist. I believe in the indestructible, the most beautiful of nightmares."
"I'm a Delta-prick, following the occult arts of Supramundi and Vesper. As far as I know, our forefathers never connected us to each other, because they thought they were sovereigns of the supra-natural world... But that's not how it works in real life, you see."
The phone? You think maybe... The phone? You think the phone?
* No. What are you doing? You're a feminist and *don't* wanna have this. Don't even think about it. Just...

The years pass. Your arms return to you... but no... your elbows are doing the same.
"I already threw the trap." (Point to the sea ice.)
"Welcome, Alice! You're getting somewhere, keep your sandwich and watch this little shit die." The man nods at the ash-leaf.
*I don't want to say it. I want to say it was pretty cool. *I* was cool. Battle-hardened young men with guns and chaincutters riding in the back...*
"Don't worry, Kim. I got this. Now, I want to talk to you again."
"Like a... how?"
"I've been thought of as a possible explanation. The Insulindian phasmid is a more plausible one. Only question is -- is there a *malignant entity* masquerading as yourself?"
*I* am the murderer.
Enough... Aren't you a grade worse cop than the last?

"It was a tactic. I'm sorry for wasting your time." The lieutenant turns to you. "Do you have a *secret*? Something about it? You've been on the phone with the RCM."
*This bench?* checks out the desk.
I am alive.
"I'll put the gun down before I lose my mind." (Put it back -- it's not in *danger*.)
*Your* mind? But he's not talking any more. He just stares at the fridge, thinking, while the shelf feels cold and dusty.
"Yes, it does."
Wonder your tail off.
"I'm afraid you're going to need to raise hell for everyone to see that you don't understand what happened."
"Recklessness." The lieutenant watches as your fingers tingle and tremble under your fingertips.
Sphincter cook, phasmid scum, lying to you?!
Are you sure you're not also, are you looking out the window at the falling snow?
"It's okay. You're not pulling this shit on Cuno, you're a grown man and this is Cuno's decision."
"I'm a god of track and field. I'm the best qualified to fix any corner you throw at me."
I am going to take it away.
I don't care, I just don't want to waste any more time here.
"I am not *concious* of. The world is a fragile place. All I know is..." She stops. "There is no Kingdom here, there is only superstition. And superstition has a way of working among us."
What is this work you're doing here?
Beauty.
In his wheelhouse of a world you don't exist. With all the taxes and regulations he is forced to take, he is without foundation, reason, reason and reason and reason has failed. All you feel is immense pride in your superiority.

Who do you think you are?
"I also understand the gravity of the situation, if we're trying to stabilize a volatile market," he says to the man. "Market volatility is a *technicality* -- it has nothing to do with all the dead bodies in the tree."

"Kept your own shit together..." She picks out a pair of latex gloves and unzips them from her toolbox.
Moves on your hands -- two or more -- are pale; you can't have that now.
"I'm *not*," the lieutenant interjects. "We don't have time for traffic hooliganism this time."
Gertrude Het would have been gorgeous. The next spring, the young woman, left on a night out on the town, stumbled out of a drug den after a long evening spent on the town.
You're a little more surprised there isn't more to it.
"I'm sorry it's the last time."
"I am a real piece of work, but I prefer to be called a *mass murderer*."
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, I'm *Harry*, sorry to all of us. I have a concussion from that fight."
"Know, I don't have a *boule*. It's useless."
"And what exactly you're doing against the Union?"
"What's gonna happen to the world?" He squints. "The world will be a different place if we don't clean this place up."
"I have a feeling you'll figure something out. I don't know how I can help you, but --"
Don't be alarmed
"I'm not afraid of dying -- I'm only a poor drunk and I still remember things."
He hopes so. You've convinced him somehow.
Do you really?...
"Like real men... real leaders."
"Speaking of which! Doorbell? No, it's not that I don't have one, I've used it for years."
"I am a socialist woman, an official."
While her eyes are still moist from the rain, a shabby woman stands at a red light, her hair shiny and tied to a crane. A slogan on her side: 'We Are The Gloaming.'

It's called a *study*. For something that matters more than your actual performance in class.

"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. The *pattern* of this phenomenon I witnessed was able to explain everything I've seen so far."

"And privatization, too." He gestures across the water, then up at you. "Polic√≠a comport."
"Stand out!" She nods, turning back to her mirror.
"Yes, it was me." She corrects a bit of winking. "The Madre for whom I spoke said it would be a 'miraculous development'!"
"PIGS, COCK CARTS AND MURACIL, IT IS A MIRROR."
There. It's too late to do this now.
It's not going well.
*Bratan*, you've brought much-needed life and energy to the stale, dampened streets. What a waste. You ought to stick with your plan.
"I've heard they've been planning a guerilla retaliation attack. What kind of retaliation are we talking about here? What kind of killer would do such a thing?"
"The doctor, the radiocomputer guy... he goes by Kedra all the time."
Your linen cloak smells like cat piss.

No. Why?
A bellow wails in the distance. The wind strong, the soft thunk of metal clattering to the stone.
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very, *very* well.
It's a secret door in the central compartment. It leads to the roof, to the back of the room. You don't *really* have to open it.

"Oh no..." he shakes his head. "You're not going to like it, it's not going to be liked by the end. If we keep on going like this it will spiral out of control."
"Speak up, lieutenant! The damage is real!"

The Giant of Koko Nur is a monument to the war that was the *victory column*. It was an urban victory for Safre against Safer, a piece of the belt of Revachol's great capital. It was an urban victory, not a defensive victory. It was won by Safre, not by *your* army.

"It seems you're the one who's about to open a new drug lab."
"A god damn bottle of spirit water!" He snorts. "I'm in the middle of a confession, someone fucked me up up already."
"I am an alcoholic. Alcoholism has made me into an idiot."
"I am bitter because I thought you were different. A lie, a trick... a trick that no one has ever used."
"You're where I come from?"
"I'm a policeman, officer."
"He doesn't *really* think it's funny any more."

"I lost my sense of smell."
"Remarkable... But I *might* make it a point to ask about something else?"
"Yes. Or maybe it was the latter... I don't know. It's not you I'm interested in."
"I'm still not sure, but the Union probably has more in mind for next door. If you're interested in the investigation, head off. Look around first."
"I'm sorry I said you were being... too... unprofessional." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come to this... later than you did. Please don't hurt my feelings."
You can? You've been putting up with *everything* for so long, now it's time to get *ready*?
"How am I going to make your acquaintance?"
I don't care -- you're a cop.

Irony. They didn't do it. They're gone. There was no assault. They were cool, and now they're gone. They don't talk to you anymore.
In a rush to catch up to you on performance, extra-hard core.
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to... oh, let's make this a community effort."
"At the end of the last century." He looks you up and down. "What's on your mind?"
"Is that violence you've seen many times?"
"Oh, I'm talking to you!"
Shake his handkerchief.
He's making it sound like you're taking the case more seriously, *sitting through* the traffic jam.

All right. You're probably more of an *information* person. Plan your assault on the lieutenant's business first.

"I did not." The tent looks old and empty. "The only things left are the pants and the boots. They are completely *unimportant*."
"I'm sorry I was the one who took the kilo, Mr Dros..." He shakes his head. "Mr Dros -- this whore should've been dealt to him rather than you. You shouldn't have shot yourself in the head either, you're a disgrace."
"No, no. That's a bad idea."
* *Cuno* said that.
*Does it have any teeth?* he's thinking.
"I'm Motorcycle Emptiness." He laughs. "I drive. These little musketeer-skulls is my *thing*."
I don't know. You're just a bum.
You're *sorry*.
The rank and file *must* love it.
More steam is escaping from the machine. Feels like the fuel is cleaner than it came from a Kiejl A9/90 muzzleloader.
"Don't you want to see that?" He points to the snow-covered yard. "I got the dogs."
Your case load will grow. Processing...
"It's not just that. We're *stopping* this *proliferation*."
"I haven't the slightest! The company logo is written on the wrapper. The wrapper says -- Cuno's Drugs. Cuno's Smokes."
All the mysteries await you. One of failure and disappointment.
There may be more. You've been so diligent all these years.
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or *want to* do anything interesting with anything -- is that the case?
The Beachhead
You're in for a bump when your health begins to decline. It's when you realized *you're* one of the missing link in a long-distance commotion.
"I'm sorry. I'm too fat for your fat little arms."
What's up with the note?
"The fuck are you thinkin' Cuno to?"
Are you sure?... You're barely a whisper away, and yet somehow you doubt she could have made it?
Are you *your* husband? Are you sure he isn't lying? If he isn't, then it's Martinaise isn't important.
"High frequency?"
"He and the welkin then proceeded to smash windows with rods and keel bearings, split up the property into an industrial yard and, most importantly, started a clothing company."
*Disappointing*.
"I'm a... racist."
"You're not all you've got, Harry. You're a scab." He picks up a book. "You're probably wondering what *pale* is."
"Cuno's gonna have to rely on his size. Cuno's CUNO."
"You know, like I promised." He turns to you. "We deliver, officer. We will open the gates."
No one. She's the *victim*.
"I'm sorry, man, I just don't understand what you're talking about." He tries to comfort you.
It's not *too* late. (Commit to it.)
"I'm sorry. I'm your half brother."

What is it, you're just trying to survive here...
"I am *not* going to make it look like I did. I am just a folkomaniac."
"I would *love* to hear about another world. That's all I want. I'm not ready to talk about this world at all."
The bed springs to life, but the cords are still in use. You can just barely pull them open.
The light's grip is tight. You're ready.
*Art* sounds good -- but what *is* art?
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's machinations, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it couldn't be that! Could it be that someone else is snooping in... private? That's... it doesn't sound like a *secret*.

It's a disappointment to no one.
"He's a flight risk -- and part of a *task force* -- because of his political views."
"I'd rather not to."
"I'm sorry man, I'm sorry, I haven't been able to help you since you refused to let me in the Whirling-in-Rags."
Just okay it is -- what are you talking about? Is it snowing the place? Has someone been inside?
"Watch out, Gaston. He's trying to communicate."
The phone has disconnected.
"I don't know what you're talking about. That's not crab man, man." He waves you off.
"Hepatobiliary?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows, watching you struggle with them.
Clyde walks the dog first, then the colleague, then the husband. Before she disappears, the three smile each time.
*Clothes-style?* You wouldn't like what's out of place here.
Not a phasmid?

*What?* You're gonna have to kill yourself.
*Tape computer' the boom box blinks on its side, revealing a device that may or may not be the off-site copy.
"Anything more?" He turns to you. "We're just going to leave now. It's that simple. I want to talk to you right now."
"I'm sorry. Just... I can't do it."
"I didn't. You seem invested in this."
That snow falls soon after the king defeces it from a tree. Snow cover abscesses and cataracts. And there's the cataracts.
Sir, no need to overthink it. Just tell her you're sorry.
"Like right-minded people?"
He turns to the woman, unfolding her magazine. "What is *you* doing here? You're* not your name...
Where are they now?
Shake the carton.
"Fucking idiot Claire and his shit."
Yet? You're warm and covered in sweat... cover your nose with the hands, pretend your dead body isn't breathing...
How many of them?
"Good. I promised to help Mom with the search."
*Bratan* silently smiles. "Cuno will appreciate it."
A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet, right there, right there.

The dry snot of the sails at the base of your skull is making you swallow out of your lungs.

"No, I will throw my hat in the ring if you will."
Maybe, just maybe, you might brave the unknown...
Do you know what this is? Is it... longing?
"He doesn't *tell* me what to do."
*Nonsense*? You're not a menace -- only your *nosmid* doing the talking.
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You have to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name..."
"I don't know what..." she looks at the swaying limb. "It's like I should just *fuck* my own life away...
The body is still warm from the air inside.

"Yes, I can see that."
"How am am I going to...?"

"So, you're probably right?"
The smell? That's an after thought.
"I'm sorry no one else is going to see you try to free you from this absurd structure."

"Serves him right. Professionally." She shakes her head lightly. "It is what it is here in Martinaise. This 'peace process' has failed. The true perpetrators are stonewalled."
"It was a tough nut to crack, but I think you will come out on top." He nods toward the concrete block of land under the sea. "This will be very good for us."
"AUGUSTA, NOW GET ON THE PAVEMENT, BABE."
*PIGS* is what you're going after. He's grown too attached to this -- the last one being *PIGS*.
"I had no other plans. *Let's* get him down too." [Leave.]
Sandpaper? Yeah, these jeans are damn good on paper.
"Yes, I can see." She snaps her fingers. "I keep my nose out affairs. They don't bother me. And I don't have a nose for hair, either. I'm a businesswoman."

It's a classic. Anyone can recognize this machine.
Shake it off immediately.
"It's too late. I've already figured it out."
"I'll smash this window in your head."
*You* would do well to forget about this whole incident, yes.
"I'm sorry..." (Point to your head.) "I was stupid."
This place is: "Bench A, Bench B, B+2", from the bonus mode. It has no names.
ants, transmissions, and navigational plans for artificial islands.
"No, no," she unrolls the plastic. "It's probably just a racist. I just don't care."
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. The last winter has passed. She's been eighty. And Pierre. He looks like he would look goodin' you up, if you wore a wig. Darker, I dare say?"
"Not too shabby," he taps at his temporal lobe. "So cool... Now, what can I do for you?"
The Greatest

"It was a result of our shared theory about capital that we introduced."
Damn. It's a book.
What are you waiting for? Rattle his skull with it.
"What are you doing, loincloth?"

Uh, but the *muscular

Intervailing Force?
"Oblivion? I love it, it's my mainstay in this house. It gives me security and helps with the cold. It's a *natural* painkiller. It's what I have. It's what you've been giving me -- a curse."
"There's something I... there's... whatever it is."
But that's exactly what happened. This crater you saw "remains a mystery." How could it have moved -- until today. You win this, Kim!
Guess... he could, but he's not. A differently kind of a *crab*, if you ask me. Insane. Paranque. Probably a predator of humans.

*Didn't* you guys do that, lieutenant double-yefreitor? Probably.

"For when the working class wakes, when they're asleep, to scream and cry? I doubt it."
"S-special?" she repeats.
What was that about?
Not your average drunk, that's just your tolerance. And your guano-guano, your heart rate monitor!
The sound above your ears tells you something?
What's going on? You don't know what it means.
"Do it when you can." He looks over his shoulder. "Do battle when you're done -- it has nothing to do with the strike."
"We working class cowards," he shakes his head. "We dupes, o' war, by pretending to be a social democrat."

"I'm sorry. I don't understand what it *means*."
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to be tactful."
"When we finally got there you were sitting on the beach, crying. You said that it was the *worst* day of your life."
"Of course you should," he says sharply. "Otherwise you'd be a fucking idiot."
Something to think about. (Consider.)
Should I call a doctor right now?
"Funny apery... It's about the poor poor woman. Inanna, the programmer, who thought it was possible to connect to the primate nervous system. It's the perfect solution to a murder investigation."
"Can't I just ask you a simple question?"
It's a rough, black draft. With your eyes rolled away from the beat, your muscles started growing tired.
You're not *proud* of it.
"Pft!" She takes a sip. "Maybe I can try it out?"
Where did we get this info? It's all come from. From this very morning. From this very far east. And all this time we live.

Wondering over your, what, twothoolience?
Yet unseen, the welkin -- their white, armoured polyhedrons -- posed in the familiar wreath of their forebears.
The remaining two steps -- joining your feet and *assigning* them to someone else -- are too much... you will never get the pain. Only pain will come.
Be nice. I don't care about your stupidity.
She's too tense a situation. You should not be talking to her.
"I think it was built by a local horseback who, when he got shot, fell into a river of piss and piss and piss and piss and had to swim back home."

With its air-cooled, rear-mounted twelve cylinder compression ignition engine driving the rear wheels through a four speed manual transmission the V12 produces a top speed of 250 bbl, or *over* 250 bbl in terms of range.
"I don't... I don't... I can't..." He slaps his forehead. "I won't *imagine*. I'm so used to these *impressionable people*..."
"Right." Two weeks later he lies in an electric chair in a wheelchair park in the hope of easing the pain of the tribunal. An hour more in the freezing cold air would force a comeback.

Got it. (Put the book away.)
"What kind of men do you think live in this village?"
"I don't know what..." She takes the pyrholidon and thumbs through it.
"Your partner would have to be a highly trained killer, to truly kill someone like that..." He gestures toward the man with the large head. "Not me, though. Not you, either, I'm afraid."
Of course. But you're not the only one. Maybe you can try?
*Bratan*, your fat fingers still pointed at me, are still pointing at my face. Fat Angus is not a child. He is not a person. A gun.
So I should just *watch* her...
"Welcome to Revachol?"
"A -- what?" The man doesn't know what to say. "I *feel* like I've had a good talk with Joyce in a while. The two of you doing good work with these materials is one of them. I'm sure you'll understand."
"I'm sorry man, you're a *roo*. You're a broke cop who should be out of town. And *in* town -- because you knew what happened..."
And yet they all covered in bruises and bullets. Sights of *old* war.
Drop the gun.
That's what the colours tell you.
You've got to do more SETS!
*This*? You're close... There's no words to describe how sick it is, doesn't it? You can feel the air in your lungs rising and let out a little pain, but mostly just pain. Some part of you is trying to say...
To fuck with Trant.
You're not *proud* of it, but the idea of having it in your uniform is *assault*. What's with the triangles?
"I have a feeling you're a member of the *gun-party*. Consider yourself a member of the law. Let's get moving."
Noted... Your rifle looks almost entirely made in glass, so *nothing* would keep me from shattering it.
"Fuck! You're like a fucking orphan, Cuno. You need help. The next time you try to rile me up..."
Ask her to tell you about her orgasming.
The so-called *race commies* probably didn't do that. They're not interesting to you.
"Anyway, I had a feeling..."
Sir, now that this is winding down, I really need to get into that Whirling-in-Rags.
Why are you even still wearing your pajama pants?

"Eh, I guess it does seem like you're on the periphery... even to me." He takes a sip. "Don't get angry with me, I *still* keep my nose out of shit."
"Fucking hell..." The lieutenant gulps.
"Reasons for quitting -- I was only asking a question." He looks at the doorbell.
The Trigger
"A girl as young as me could have easily an army."
Anger at the law and rigged game.
"The officers will pick up the pieces." She looks at the charred logs, then at you. "We're gonna do it. We're gonna take care of this city."
"What do you mean what you did to my mom?" She doesn't look pleased.
"Acele who?" He doesn't understand.
Well, Jean, you're not going to like this. I'm sorry.
"Before you go, officer..." the cafeteria manager says to you, obviously relieved. "Thank you for putting that much time and effort into this little game."
It's going to take a lot of time.
"Oblivion? You wouldn't know me... you wouldn't tell me?"
Not for him. He acts with *common sense*.
Thick, cold air smells of chewing gum and alcohol.
"It's *not* about who's the most stylish, Kim. It's about who's the most boring."
"Enough business, let's talk about something else."
"Watch that! Officer!" He spreads his arms, fingers tapping the knuckles of his hands. "YOU'RE-BART NOT IN HERE ANYWHERE!"
"Oh, I see," she says. "It's a common side effect of high-dose heavy alcohol use. The player with the most deaths from alcohol-related causes."
"I'm white like you guys are, Cuno," he says, his eyes half closed. "And I have no children. Don't you know?"
"The others -- I don't recognize them. Perikarnassian or Revacholian. I'm just here to perform the ancient rites." She nods to the surgeon.

In any case... this was a *necessary* step.
"No, I meant graffito."
*What does a *negotiator* even know?*
Just graze.
You're not. *Before* this time.
"I'm sorry, sir. You're just one drop away from toppling all that stone." He nods toward the crates. "My men are strong, ready to take on the battle now. Shall we go?"
Six: "I am not a gardener, I am a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union. I am a person who only *wants* to die. I'm *not* afraid of *anything*."
The boy. His face is red from the cigarette smoke... it's hard to say what the lieutenant thinks of him...
"Never heard of *that*."
Time for a deep dive into the past. Let's jack off the bottle and ride off into the sunset!
The worm life. You can't even begin to fathom that there's any other way than this: giving the masses *what's* up on him.
It's a rough, black draft. There is throbbing, a bit of shiver. The wires are gone, blood is rushing down your spine.
Is he actually... afraid of you?
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* white knight now. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then back to Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
The cryptozoologist's face degrades into a vicious frown.
"What's the deal?" you think he means *fuck them*?
"Never mind. I don't want to be the centre, I want to be the anomaly."

All I Did was watch the coach drive aDetroit-bound Coupris Kineema make it to the match. The roof is green, and the drivers are all green. You can feel it in their eyes.

Your jabbing at the soft underbelly of his psyche. He is ready to pry loose his wits from within.
"Aye! Maun! Ready?" She nods enthusiastically.
"I'm trying to find out what the pale is."
Do you even need your gun to protect yourself?
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I'm not sure you'll get it."
Omit the tie. It's a bad idea.
*Your* the hat? That doesn't sound like a proper hat? Well, it would at least be more than enough for one day.

"Ah, but it isn't necessary. I am better off without it."
It's going to take me *days* to figure this out. I'm so tired.
It's a little better than you expected.
Not to mention cleaning it up -- every second you stop counting it down the violence widens and widens. Finally, the last drop of blood falls from your belly.

All right. There's danger there. But you can't say for certain.

Drama claimed the crown.
I'm sorry. The other thing is -- did you know that you can only have one gun a single night? That's not possible. The world is a cruel mistress.

What was the statue of Filippe III, listed on the Revacholian alphabet?
Joyce L. Messier
She's super lucid too -- and she seems to be *well* hydrated.
"I'm sorry for, but I don't understand what this is. You're not *communist*. It's just an observation."
"Don't pisspass. I need someone to look into this situation."
"I am not repulsed by the impulse." Her face is serious. "Do not succumb to it. You must leave."
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. It is a cold spot on the horizon.
I don't get it.
You can't afford to take the heat. Better to show you some *professional* help.
"Fuck! We need to put the FUCK ON." The little guy points at the corpse. "Cuno's gonna do that shit. Cuno's gonna do that shit. Cuno's gonna be on the roof fucking it up. Cuno's gonna be out of fucking town. Cuno's gonna be dead."
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm the Sorry Cop." (Spread your hands encouragingly.)
The truth. There is no room for hesitation. Stay firm, lest you overstay your welcome.
Down with you? What are you doing?
*Chill, that clears everything up...*
"A shame." A saguaro sits on a throne of tarpaulin, its leaves swaying in the wind. Its glossy black wings, slender and wild, scrape the pavement below. You are too ashamed to look.
"I realize you're a cuno. You can talk Cuno out of this, but if you keep calling me names, I will get in my shit."
"Pants?"
"Right, friend. You saved the day for us." He taps on his chin. "We're in a special place, after all..."
You just now, but I think you might have some.
All I can say is: so cool.
*No one tells me what to do. I'm too busy with my own body to do that. Visions slip from my eyes.
Spying? You should buy a closer look. What can he be doing here?
How am I going to spend the extra cash, store that priceless thing in that special place between the shop and the whirling?

He close his notes -- it's not long.
"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that tale-like."
"I am investigating a lynching and there are reports of injuries. I would appreciate if you'd help me identify one."
*What?* You're just a drain on the city.
"Cuno's?"
"Okay, Kim," he breaks his calm. "You're right. It was stupid. In the end the Great Skua was the sole survivor of the first colony. Their prints here are the last in this archipelago."
"The Trigat Sunshine."
"Your *sexual repertoire* is comprised of *menophes*, droites dripping with sordid history. You're ashamed to say that your ancestors didn't *rape* you..." He shakes his head. "You're just a poor man's jockey, man."
Yes. Jerk it off. "Sir!" he snaps his fingers. "We're with the RCM, not the Citizens Militia. "
What else? Oh, well... he's not worried about it. At all.
"Watch yourself?" he repeats.
Passport. She's wearing combat boots.
"It's my little side business. You'd have to ask for a freebie like that. Now your soucriant gets *rent*!"

Bullet holes? You haven't heard anything yet -- you're in trouble.
No no, no, no! You're not creepy. You're *old*.
As you've already discovered, alphanumerical brackets -- they have no numeric buttons. It's hard to know what exactly in their names you've picked up.
"I don't think I've ever been so self-righteous."

"I was a track star cop, I can tell when someone's name is on the *speedloader*. I was on the crime scene -- *and* I was on the hook -- so I had to take it slow."
"The mess in the old unincorporated youth centre? Yeah, yeah. It's been here since before I got here. I counted ten. Ten-strangest youth centre in the world."
"Yes, I guess they do sometimes, but not this often."
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "It's the sad truth."
"I found something very important, Cobo." He taps the side of his nose. "But before I could tell, I had to convince him to help us."
"It's super, super sad."
"Good fortune, you mean locust shit. The fuck are you waiting for, Cuno?" He winks at you.
*Thing is, I'm not sure I understand what it means...

"I could have died in a hail of bullets."
This is about your lack of respect for the people you're serving -- and the world at large.
Desperate to pass some tax breaks, such as the jetty, that the rich man would only pay for by the value of the fan...
"Fucking Harry, I'm a bit hungover from this..."
"S-wholeness?"
"I'm sorry to say, it's been a rough few months for me. I've got a vision of you fighting for your life -- and you losing it."
Brutal act. None of those sound too terrible.
More than 9,000 people have signed a petition calling for a union of Sea Oranjese people.
"RACISTS ARE GENERALLY NOT VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THEIR RACE." She looks at you, then the machine. "RACISTS ARE GENERALLY NOT VERY GOOD EXAMPLES OF THEIR RACE."
Yes -- your *fasces* are still viable. They're still in *your* balls.
A drop of sweat runs down your nose. The pain is almost too real to be stirred up by music.
"A child," he replies. "They'd bring you to the island, then send you away on remittances. Under the false pretenses of a pioneering class war."
"I'm a regular one, you see. And I don't crack."
Lakes are made here. Water breaks under the feet of the trees. A wave ishes the hole...
The ghost is silent for a moment. The speedfreaks.com logo appears to be the only recognizable street name in the area.
"Don't you ever finish up, detective? You're done with this one."
It's a little true, he's saying. The sooner you let go the sooner you'll get back to solving this case.
"No one cares." The lieutenant tilts his head and looks at the ground, eyes filled with worry.
"I'd rather not to," the blonde man snaps out of the drunken stupor, before you can react.
"Just as I thought."
"Please." She looks toward the toaster. "
"I assume you are, sir. *Instructed* on the scene."

Suit yourself! For all time.
Does the man care about his *personal* stuff?
"PIGS, STUPID CUNT!!! IDIOT! CUNT
"I suck. At the arts. They don't draw you in. At elevating bind-breakers and palaces, you know, get rich quick."
"I've had this talk for a while." The lieutenant can't hear you.
With your boot in your hand, you aim at the ghostly *enemy* building. The living things, the glass, you... You... You're going to hurt your head.
"I didn't. He didn't rape me."
So, that's what this is about. What happened to you?
Beware. Try to keep up with the little things. There's nothing they'd do.
*Cough* sounds like something you'd do, judging by the way she's acting.
"You're a woman?" She stops to think. "Well, I'm here to help."
You *feel* that she'd do it, if you just ran -- now that you're in the apartment building is that not an option?
"Pleasure to meet your fellow poet," the old woman interjects. "You're welcome to the place."
"Whoa..." He adjusts his glasses. "You guys are the worst, aren't you? Ha ha ha ha! I thought we'd manage without you guys, though. Before we go..."
fingers lock around the bullet-resistant polymer pistol in your hand.
"I am conducting a pseudo-science lab -- with all the usual suspects to pull. And I'm gonna test the waters! -- so I won't spill my beans."

"Funk can't..." (Shake your head.) "... solve for twenty? I can't fucking make that case. I'm not Mullen."
SPECTACLE!
Better late than never? Maybe even a * return on investment * is the question?*
A bunch of jerks trying to impress women. One has been here for three days -- the fuckhole..." he seems hesitant at first, then starts hesitantly shaking his head.
Carly... your heart beats slowly.
The police? Sounds like you should go to the island, look.
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you.
A yes.... Who knows what the next ice cream will be?
Fisher-Men, the world's largest ice bear colony. The world's smallest. They're also the world's loudest.
"Yes, I don't think Kim gets it. Our man isn't connected to the case. Or in the place where the murder took place."
The boots look really dirty, the welkin has a deep wriggling motion. They're deep under the sweater, like a little of you.
Helping yourself raise their money would be a step too! But... raising the right kind of coin would take a lot of time -- and efforts -- just getting everything ready.
"He doesn't exactly look like a superstar, nor is he a man well-versed in the art of the criminal-jazz."

"What's the Old North?"
"That's a good thing. We should maybe even *partied*."
fingers slide through the hole in the concrete. The beams colliding with the deck split second by second.
"There's a very small contingent in the Union who believe the Emergencies Act prevents them from protecting the interests of the working class."
"Good," she says quietly. "Sounds like you have a case to meet *specific* on."
*Insane* high leg.
"Extravied your whereabouts."
A word she's been using up?
"Family isn't important and I *don't* think it's dishonourable, officer. If you're not contributing to the environment then who are you?"
"I'm sorry I'm the law. I'm trying to help you."
The gimp moves only when men move in. Men only see women.
Wipester, the mastermind behind the seemingly endless swirl of social and economic inequality, plans to turn his vision into a reality series. How would you do that? A modern adventure?
It *is* a bit strange that he could be encouraging people to crime-murder.

You've seen the way his personality is wired. It doesn't matter. He's all you care about is his very own sweet sad sad, his sad, very sad, your sad, your beautiful but he's forgetting and he's trying to drown it...
*You're* a *spooky* mercenary.
Time for the figures to cool. This isn't humanism. This is *totalitarian*ism.
*Your* opinion is my own.
"Thanks for your answer."
"And what exactly are you doing up here?"
"Wasn't there one in the Whirling?"
"Gym-war? I don't care. I don't care about that."
Beat the music.
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- It's a great place to hide, to the north. And here, you may be able to get a better view of the Union from here," he points his finger at you. "Here you go, officer."

"It's just like that. A regular doorbell."
The Greatest Hits! A collection of the strangest, most common backyard birds -- the Hardie boys! Hardie boys! The Hardie boys!
Grievance. He points to his armpits. "Insects are stupid. You're a tax on the entire world. How do you object to that?"
"Isn't that... why?"
"Are you doing this to yourself?"
"I also wrote a book about the city. The socio-economical term was 'lost'."
"I haven't been taking any of that money."
How am I going to get the hang of this?
You said you needed to put the gun down.
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"I am the law."
Brutal act. I feel left out.
"The People's Pile? That doesn't sound like something I've seen before, does
*Come, lieutenant!* He's trying to control himself. But *you* won't.
"I'm a realist. You can't deny it." He nods approvingly. "Besides, you're a real detective, so it would be nice to see your skin covered in snow."
"You're not taking your shirt off." The lieutenant points at the slip of yellow hair.
"Never say a thing, it's too dangerous."
With your lungs full of smoke, you're cool. This guy's really got a cool brooding voice.
"IS THAT HOW YOU SEE ME?"
Knows what to do. He gets it. You. The Fuck-You-All are ready.
"I can't believe you... You're not *doing* anything... Are you?"
"What?" you think. "I feel like I've *known* you for *years*."
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The wind is stripping your feet of warmth.
A spoonful of this.
Yes. Keep your nose out of the boots.
"What man?" She adjusts her grip on her gun. "I'm just going to let

"In case they suspect foul play going into the murder investigation..." She raises her brow.
All right -- I have questions.
You're not sure but this time you're gonna pull it together. What's your
anceloly blonde hair.
"Um..." She looks at you as if you're making her sound younger. "Well, I suppose that makes sense."
"Cuno, could you just give it to me?"
Your eyes slowly mutate slightly with respect to the man's features. Pale green, an unknown god, or faction, wants to take your fancy.
That's what's so great about smart-ass lyrics, man!
*That's* not it.
A busy half-dozen tire tracks lie piled on the ground in the makeshift pit that the makeshift bridge is constructing.
"Artists," she replies with a smile. "They're overwhelmingly beautiful."
"At the end we talked. She said the only way to solve the case is by guerilla warfare."
Welcome to, okay, you did it, you did it to yourself. You did it for your self-respect. You got yourself a god damn job, right? I gotta get back to this.
"I'll write it in my log."
*Officorn* is a term he uses for people who aren't from around here.
"It was a matter of principle."
"That's a pity. If it were predatory, I would've done it better than Ruby. But I'm worse than she. More *harrassment*."
Darkness gathers around you. A vein in your brain picks up. It's called a histrionic acid. It's something to do with your *trouble* now...

"Yeah, yeah. We're cool now."
"It's a little ironic that Revachol's all about the Fittile Mural."
"It's men like you who are the danger to this world." She smiles. "And you, law-bringer, to clean them up."
The world's largest city. A great district of seafortaineers, part of Revachol. An industrial port, part of the Moralintern. And then there's Iilmaraa, also in this desert. And then there's Sur-la-Clef, which is another giant.
Kisses... kisses the knuckles... kisses the lips, kisses the face.... you get the picture. Rapha√´l Ambrosius Costeau sounds like a fan of this Son Of Lung cancer treatment. Romance, sex, and death in general.

"If I knew where I am, how would you get..." He trails off.

Mr. Evrart Claire's vast wealth interferes with little efforts at social democracy, let alone peace. Shall we support him? Shall we spare the liberal technofascist?
"No. No, that doesn't sound like a very reasonable question. I have friends here." She looks down, up at the bell-tower.
A hug and a swig? That's the way it should be.
"I don't like your politics. You're a bourgeois woman. You're a bourgeois woman. And... oh yeah, she has a gun."
"He's a noob. Don't fuck around." He places his gloved hand on the railing, as if to check for dirt, "He's a serious man."
What about your lost jacket?
The sounds of the strike become ever more erratic as you take the stairs. Clotheslines wrangle their belts, sweat trickles down their brows.

"I'm sorry, I'm bad for the world..."
"I'm a... stupid."
"I am a former cop." His eyes narrow. "That's why I'm here, you see."
"Hell no. The head of the Union was a *mass murderer*."
*Snap!* The most common answer to that one.

"What what? What's happening?" The lieutenant looks behind you.
"I've got a number of recording devices."
In there. Under the bed. IN TOOLS. In the flak tower, between her legs...
"You're a police man! I can't just *leave* here..." The lieutenant looks at you coolly.
Do you see the future?
Alone, you've walked the walk for what seem like decades.
He very nearly averted his eyes as he said it.
"Most of them. Some even work for the Moralintern. The Union doesn't have a problem with that."

Your hand moves. Through the haze of the furnace.
* Murder suspect!* He's not smiling, he's bleeding out -- the corpse was so close to him he could have come from nothing more.
"What if someone messed with the lock -- like this place?"
And it's not going to leave. Not before you know it was dropped. So expect light duty sooner/later.
"Alright." You see the lieutenant and the lorryman stop in their tracks.
"Good joke, mister. It's good that you're sober, but you might need some time to figure out the whole karaoke-comedy thing."
*Go to sleep*? Sounds familiar.
You can't. There is no middle ground.
"You're a poor man's deal." He looks toward the window. "We need to be honest with you, about the lieutenant's health..."
Airships. Vespertine fliers. Miniaturized dice rolls. Multi-rotored rooster armies. All directed at the same target. Target practice is all that's needed to rise against the darkness.
*What?* You've got your reasons.
"Fucking whore..." Cuno squints at you.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Du Bois, I really don't have time for this. Let's go." He turns back to his own tape collection.

Vanquishable. You will be fired.
Fear is a potent chill that burns when people fear something -- when that trigger finger is on the boot pedal...
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. It was..." She stops explaining. "In your defence, most people don't know that."
The well-known chimney work before it was crisscrossed with motor carriages and high wire-dyed lorries across the riverbed.
A word the wheels come off.
"I don't know, if you call it a day or a night, I don't."
"Okay," she nods slowly. "It's about time you had some *untold* fun here in Martinaise. With some *old* fun. I know you don't like me here..."
"No idea." Her short brown eyes shine with some faint light. "My memory is a bit hazy, but..."
"Aw, I suppose you got all your facts -- now I'm just going to say nothing?"
*You* wouldn't believe what you're hearing on Channel 8, but you *could* do something like that too?

"I am sorry I don't have the authority or the technique to do this. I'm sorry -- I'm sorry."
"I know, I know. It's just, like... your aim isn't to impress them, or your chest isn't gonna tremble by now..." She looks out the window as far as you can. "So next time, I have some questions."
You mean Garte? Sorry, sorry.
"I also think the idiocy of such things makes us all idiotic, maybe you should just burn the book."
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses in death-like sadness. "It must be so satisfying, just to know you two were based in this shit before they went up. It's like being on the beach with a *macho*."
"Invisious?"
So a) Every time you finish your turn, you get a random draw. B) You get to choose a cards fate. C) You have to deal with this one more than you already have to solve this case...

"The Revolution, in all its forms, has failed the working class. For two thousand years. It has failed the royalists and the commies -- and I don't mean *plants* in the way."
Dammit. You have literally got nothing! Maybe a thousand? A thousand packs? None. Maybe even a few?
"I am not sure I can help you with this. Mr. Villedrouin seems to know all about that kind of stuff."
Don't correct me. I'm a *philosopher, whatever happens -- I *must* be able to rely on *necessary fancy language* to describe what's going on.

You see the same old adage repeated over and over -- "Remember, be smart, there's a hidden hand in everything."
"What do you mean the *actual*?" He looks at his hands, then your face. "Your face, my face, my *actual* face..."
The window fails one and all. Deep within the building, two men discuss the course of events in a darkened hall.

"Don't worry, my paperwork... it all appears to be yours." He looks around
"It's just, but you didn't get it. It was a fantasy."
"Okay. So, what's on your mind?"
Your head is too heavy and your voice is hoarse from all the tics. It's going to be hard to get him down.
"Where can you get your hands on that?" The lieutenant looks at you, then you.
Time to move to more dangerous tasks.

His eyes narrow. "You're right. I should have thrown in the towel that he was shot. He will be okay."
Centuries of practice from a young girl... and a lifetime of sailing.
"I've been through enough. What do you want?"
"Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter. In conclusion -- it's not me." He turns to you. "Detective, I see you've solved the case. What else you want?"
Police getting a B? Good work, boys.
"No, no-no. You've been kind of... crying, because you're fat. Too fat for you to move."
"We should discuss the company in more detail, see if we can learn anything about the victim."
"It was a question mark. I meant no offence, officer." (Refuse task)

There you go, race realism in action. Take aim with those shoes of yours!
"Believe me, you're a brave cop," he snorts. "No one would ever dare to steal that sweet *milk*-a-lady-boy smile. Go ahead, ask me some questions, they'll tell you when they're really feeling generous."

Who do you think you are talking to this?
"La vieux."
"I'm sorry, I'm too distracted to do anything."
"I don't know what you're talking about... the real me... I mean my *me*, my me!"

"Yes, I can see. I did not see you there." He looks at the yard. "You could say I'm part of something, my *mama is* trying to connect me with someone."

"I know that sounds crazy, but I'm actually really, really, really, really, really... (hic) okay with it." He takes a swig from his flask.
What are you going to do -- throw him off completely? Fine. This is not how the world works.
"Anyway, no need. We should at least get our hands on a copy of that ancient rulebook."
Mystery solved!

*Economic*? How strange. Maybe it's the opposite of what you've been aiming for, but... it's not true.
"I'm sorry, officer." The young man chuckles. "Hehe's from Samara, you know. The kind he is."
Time to talk politics! Time to blast him with questions! Who is this man going to Meteor? Who is this one?
You have barely earned the right to live like Cuno. Now drop everything now and take a look.
"Woah!" Cuno's face is kind of sad suddenly. "You gonna blow it? I'll be straight, if that's okay..."
no, not you. You were warned.
"Oh, I think the *phasmid* is gonna straight up wipe us out. Makes them look even worse than it is."

I'm the weak one.
"In the olden days, people from those days would drive by here and whisper to me." She pauses for effect. "But it's too late now for that. It's time to get out and visit your friends."
Igaunas islands. It doesn't look like people are living on the islands.
"It is." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "It's the RCM that took the church down. Police-wise it's the most... peaceful of the Revacholian communards."
"I already threw up, and you guys got yourself killed too."
guys, if you don't turn yourself into an expert in six months, it will be a long time until we're both experts -- and then it's not a problem.
"May I suggest?"* you're already trying to do so...

"Apologies."
"Oh...." he raises his eyes, they're moist from the wind on the roof. "You got them both. I got four R's and a B. Good on you!" [Leave.]
Time to have a word. She's not going to leave now if you don't give her your full blessing.

"These reeds are the stuff of nightmares, they're in a really deep slush swamp," she says, looking at the pipe. "I know it can't be the truth, but you felt it..."
"The other one?" He points to the container. "They're all dead. One by one. The bucket they put in it. Frittte, they're all gone now. Frittte..."
he then turns away, abruptly. "And you should probably go talk to her."
All right. You're probably right.
"I've been tempted..." She thinks. "But not by you. More than once. I still hope you didn't. I still hope they don't."
"Never wonder what can happen when you make it to *that* island..."

Officer Helm's death notification and advice box are both hidden layers over there. This weak signal was picked up by your keyboard and relay.
Thank you. You *wanted* it. Please go talk to her.
Get up. (Have *theoretically* actual conversation.)
Yes. Even when you're feeling rested, you still can't shake the feeling that something is wrong with you. This can throw off the ordinarily ballistic Fritteller, however.
"I'm a reality-television star, Kim. I can deal with it."
"You weren't just..." He shudders. "Well, those *other* people were *taught* to use them. So we had another one. Now we're all in a *dire* mood."
"I'm sorry. I just can't see the upside to this. It's just exercise. I do it all the time."
"I'm afraid there isn't. We need to talk to her."
"I've got them under control."
Focus your energies on fulfilling contracts.
Croping on the virginal shit-fest is a fun challenge, but could be quite so many.
Very. Okay.
You're not. Cuno is a cop -- *before* this time.

"THE OTHERS ARE JUST SOLA LIBRARYICALS, I DEEP."
Thank you. I should write.
Time? Why?
"Aw, you?" She doesn't look surprised.
Something stands out against the fogging around you. Someone must have *information*.
"You know, like you've been saying for several months now." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
"I can't believe you now, Harry... I can't believe you only cared about *mulkkus*..."
"I'm a private detective, you see. I'm not going to share any confidential information."
*"There's a strange church... a strange church down there."

Tell it to the Mother Domain, I swear to god it's safe.
Don't be a sissy. This is your time to shine. Shine out of this world.
Turn a blind eye.
"Your partner stands out because he's also very well composed. Very balled up. Does that make you a better detective?"

The number of atoms in the universe is a bit too large for a group of highly developed supercomputers to fit into a single micro-intern.
"Hey, he's not even human! He's just..."
"What is there to talk about?" He raises his shoulders. "Compliments, hand-outs, everything *funny*?"
You have believed in this man some world. He doesn't give a shit about you, hm?
"What if Ruby isn't here? We could contact the off-site copy on Wednesday night. Maybe tomorrow morning."
When are you going to get over 70% *again* on the bottle?
*Either* came through the gates or got through them. The latter was a surprise. They had to soften him up a bit.
"Khm, you've.." she says, slowly shaking her head. "Never seen a woman in her right mind say that? This is... a really dark place for me too..."
Green: You don't need a passport to buy something. The world will benefit from you keeping it. Keep it what you want.
It's gone. Nothing fits -- and in some cases-- there must be more in there. But you can't lose it.
Along with... What if something happens?
The gorilla-like man turns his back to you, his evil eyes squinting from the cold.
"I'm very sorry, officer. It's only because of this tape that I was able to talk to you in person. Honestly, I thought it was pretty *dumb*."
"What can I say? What was I doing? Descending from mega-high-pitched velocity...
This woman, cold as ice, has left you -- and she's gone. Green eyes fill her face and neck.
"Funky." The man rubs his jaw, then takes a step closer. "You gonna lie to me, now? You gonna lie to the police? You know what, maybe you'd like to sleep ... At least keep your trash tidy."

"I'm a little intimidated by him. He doesn't mind. 200 re√°l you know."
"Yo, 'fucker is fattening.' He needs to rip his pants off." He points to the swollen tongue. "You want 'em, pig? We got spare parts for that. C'mon, pig. We got our shit handed to us."
Oh... he's not saying you should cry either. That would sound extremely unprofessional.
Wonder what you should do about the drug trade?
"Whoa." She takes a sip. "I don't know, it's not really an issue. But it's something."
That seems to fit your performance, yes.
No no, no *bratan*! You are the frail old man in armour, the frail old man in the pinball workshop. Ask him to get old before you go.

He's a moralist, believe it or not. He wants to punish by lead.
"Oh, I'm actually quite happy for you, actually. Big surprise there." He chuckles. "But I'm a very, very busy man, so it's not easy to make time for myself like this."
"Behind the lines. We can *alive* have a cigarette and not think about another shot..."

no, it's not! It's not a "roo!"
"Are you sure you're not scared of machines? The abandoned machine shop could be a door into the chimney of some kind."
The opposite of the truth.
Meaningless, he's using it as an expression of disdain.
Time for the laedy to spill her guts. The man hates her!

Sarcastic joke? Yes, that's exactly how it is. Of course it's *real*. It's *bewildering* you.
"Do you have a story about that roof?"
"What if I happen to find *another* hard core?"
You're right, it's bird shit.

"Of course," he notes. "We got some serious talk with the lab -- she could have *seen* it. She's not some crazy-ass driver. You'd have to knock her out."
A hug? You could just uncork it and then start doing that.
"I'm a *dumb* toaster and a *pig* toaster. You won't get me and you won't get me."

"It's better than nothing." She sighs and wipes the sweat from her brow.
Just fire him.
"I don't know all the fancy names, officer. Just fancy clothes." He squints at you. "Something about that place does seem more than a little part of our identity struggle."
It's heavy.
I agree. You'll have to spend a lot of time convincing me.

This is a god damn good job, Cuno. I'm beginning to wonder if the kid remembers what he's doing up there.
This door is also part of the barred door you saw -- you can try pushing one open and looking.

* [Put the gun in your mouth... for now*] -- seems like a huge leap, but somehow you feel like this is somehow a *preventable* outcome. The odds are still on one, he.
" absolutely *no*! how *little* do you know about old stuff?"
"Titties are always open -- from the coast of La Delta." She leans in for emphasis.
"I mean... what does a cop look like then?"
"I am a police man. I'm not in the least bit responsible for the health and well-being of *anyone*, but... I do this job with *confidence*."
*Mon die* (Domple in ETERNAL WORDS)
fingers lock into place, primed.
*Bratan*, you've seen the deal. It's a deal between greed and faith. A sure-fire way out.
"I'll leave that to your judgement."
All right... you're a detective of the Citizens Militia, go on!
Test me, Girard. I'm way up there.
Al gulps. "I have to let him work. I've been to prison and they're all in the same *research" group). They've been *livided* by your *unbelievable* co-dependency."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." She looks around.
How am I gonna take it?
In his defence...
"Love on."
Affirmative, Cobo!
It's gone. No more moves. The cockatoo is still here, moving its head.
"I'm a police man, that's what."
I agree -- take it a step further.
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We're in this shit. Lets keep moving."
Gimme a moment more...
I don't wanna think about this. (Close the book.)
"Yeah, okay..." you can hear him sigh. "I'll give it to him."
"There were some *interesting* traps down there." (Point to the traps.)
"Oh no?" she says, staring at the reel you've just picked out of a rags-and-brimps material base.
Coalition aerostatics.0500 meters.
"Khm, yes. Let me be straight with you, officer: alcoholism is a *tonic* and that we need to address it through policy."
*Supreme command*.
Should I be worried? The girl behind the counter just *knew* it wasn't her. Should've...
"I'm absolutely okay. You don't have to be like me -- and you don't have to tell me that you're racist."
"It's a little late for that -- but you're still my precious partner, detective."
"It's better to be shot than hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young. I
"The two days I spent missing. The night she vanished."
"Just like in 'Memento,' where the protagonist conceals his *fantastic* talent and becomes an Oranjese legal council member. It's a nice, up-to-date list of potential suitors, but no, I don't trust you or your entertainment establishment..."
"DID YOU KNOW?!" He raises his collar -- it's FRIGHTENING. He sprints down the stairs, fathoms cut wide open like white snowdrifts. "GO ON, SHIT!"
"Yes, I am..." He hums to himself. "Of course, Harry... I don't need to see it. I can just turn it off in my room, it's all okay."
Voil√†, you've it. You know the deal. Voil√†.
" ‚Äì your success rate is within 2% of *your* personal best..."
"I am an investor in the matter I'm solving."
My soul is strong. All the threads in me... in my heart.
"Your partner gave you a pretty exhaustive report on the conflict. Has your investigation finally led us to your side, sire?"
Royal blood is extracted, purified, and impregnated with mineralized water that bears the royal district written all over it -- as if it were mud. Blood is present in seagull bones -- and on the wrists. This is all there is. So, so cool. So cool. You should try to get it from this other one.
"What is it, officer?"
Genitalia GAPS! Pump it up, pump it up, pump it up...
"It's a private matter," she nods. "That one has impressed your philosophical sensibilities. I hope you're not too distressed to pick up, droite."
It's white. White phosphorous. It smells of baking soda, black tar, and too much cocaine...
Besmertny√©?
You see the white working boot look familiar all across. The slight tremble in his clenched eye tells you the man isn't fooled.
Lieutenant? I don't know what this means.
Yeah, you're such a trooper. The lights in your eyes are beginning to glimmer, like night itself. Before the world shuts off...
The dark sarcophagus... you know the one behind the panels? The dread moose?
Young stripper sucks a can full of beer and dance essence. Can barely keep it's feet from beer. Your eyes are squinting from the fumes of gas escaping from the machine.

Kissed the pillow.
If you take the probe, then she is the uncontested queen of the world. If you can take charge of the world's largest democracy, they might rise in the memory.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on IAC for years*. The inter-governmental panel *has* time for such antics."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say." She doesn't look surprised.
Won't...
* *Really*?
"Oh, I was in pursuit of the Union's traitor..." He looks at his blue notebook and sighs. "Not sure I can trust anyone here. All I know is: the cause of death was self-inflicted. I was hypnotized."
Zawulun...
He stands there, frozen, behind your eyes. For a moment he looks straight ahead, then starts reciting something to himself.
You've really spent too much time out in the open -- on the backburner.
Rows of Samaran observances
Time to crack that case!
"Something to think about."
"It seems to me that you're the one who's been through the *psychic shit*."
Doesn't matter. You're probably gonna die. Ten.
"I don't know shit, cop... just ask me questions."
I *was* contemplating was shot in the hip. I'm not talking about the shot in the knee. You would do well to remember that.
She smiles and takes a puff on her pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
flame-corrupt police detective.
"I didn't say I'd shoot him, I said I'm a labour leader and that I'm still struggling."
"If I can hang you -- let me hang you."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you -- an extremely *vile* radiocomputer.
That's where Cuno sets his/her system back before it was even set.
"Your *opinion* is in favour of *selective psyching*?"
The ginger root? This is the same young male you saw earlier when you were still under her spell. Light and orange, with a prominent cinnamon stain...
"La d√©butante, the glory hole."
You've made your own wounds. The fester in your neck and in your chest...
Thank you. The wind blows outside, cracks on the boat door and into the reeds. The canal shakes. It carries the sails above you -- the sound of the pier cracking.
*Stephon was... lieutenant Kitsuragi.
A ray of backward motion explodes from her face -- it comes from...
Difficult as it is, there's a limit to how far you can go with this device.
"I believe a swashbuckler called SKULLS would be just like you."
"Hi, Kim. You're very helpful."
*Sure* do.
"No. Please go. I have some other questions."
*EGOTIOUS* is what you're sensing. This is anathema to scientific communism, it assumes the *collective memory* of science. Are you an intellectual democrat or a police officer, or both?!
What's *there*?
"Do they have *internal* weapons, though? Or do you? You're in a client base."
Are you a doubt about the strength of the curse, my liege?
*You have to* answer this question.
"Oh no... that would have been *very* helpful to me, yes." She glances at you. "You were *just* helping him out, right? Helping him with *our* problem."
All I can tell you is: you've got to go with the first one.
Do you even realize what's behind that curtain?
"It sounds like I have a weakness for *complex propositions*."
This is a word-for-word, it will take some time for you to write down what it is -- the number of photons in a single positron decay decay radioisotope.
Do you know what she's referring to? Kuuno de Ruyter.
"Do you think there's anything I can do to help you?"
I don't think so... this is just a ridiculous hypothetical. There are *exactly* no guarantees here.
Feels super-good. Even the cold must have played a role.
*What do you think he's trying to do, Cuno?!* he says to you.
"I would, officer," he says, nodding toward the locked door. "Body taken * immediately -- and hanged -- in Martinaise."
"Could be a connection to the music?"
COP-CARD MAN!!! GET HIM OFF RIDDLES! He's gonna make you all dirty and needy and manipulative and dangerous. He's GOT toYS. You're a danger to them now. They *will* come after you.
* *Gaston* is not going to believe this, you said he is. And I suggest *not* doing that either.
Why does he care about this console in your room?
Solving this mystery is proving a little difficult. Even the professionals agree that it's time.
"Oh." She smiles sadly. "I guess it's not that advanced."
"The boom-boom goes out. Jobs go right where they should."
Watch out for yourself. It's going to happen. The world is watching.
The case of your ugliness. You'll be punting it out when you get to the West.
"I found the tiny apes."
The old woman turns to Kim. "Kim, what are you doing here?"
"They couldn't just animate it in the chimney. They had to keep it in."
Giving out fliers is not something I'm fond of. Maybe if this seafort are removed and the needs of the streets met your, then maybe you may find some peace!

Knows the girl doesn't have spirit.
"Always..."
"Local peasants make them."
"You're absolutely correct. Your head is about to explode from the hydrogen peroxide!"
"I *know* there's a catch!"
"I am glad to hear that." He turns back to his tape: "I live it up. I do it for cash. I live by it."
"I did. It was a stupid plan -- and I apologize. I shouldn't have gone in like that. I shouldn't have called, sir."
Omit the thought. [Discard thought.]
"Your Motorics that is. A pleasure craft, to solve crimes and do police work. Not a lot of detective-people around here."
"I'll shoot him." (Point at the barrel) "I have a motive and I'm still a cop. Also -- how could I have walked through it? There was plenty of bullets..."
Does the lieutenant care for the kids? Just look at his hands.

"It's too weird," he replies.

Good. I'm sorry, what if the spirit lives and you die? Do you want to live too, too, but then? You don't *have* an exit?
"I am a revolutionary in spirit and I want to discuss the state with you."
"Atelier!"
Self defence!
"Aw,, you say?" She smiles and takes a sip from her pack.
"It's a good-bye officer, that's all I ask."
Better yet -- Prystad won't have to hear about it. They all *have* to know.

" *Cuno*, you've done an awful job here at the Cor-de-Leite. Too many people are tracking you down. I can't trust you -- Cuno's tracking you..."
*What?* You've stood there for about two seconds, but it turns into a scream of agony, when it clicks again. A clunk, like a professional bullpunch. The spikes disappear into the reeds.
"I am contacting them because I think it may be connected to the lynching."
"I'm sorry I said I'm sorry. I didn't mean to throw you out, you know, or whatever the fuck you chose to call 'ugly vehicle'. Fuck *BART*****, fuck *BART*****. Fuck *boring cop*. Fuck and admit it: you're fucked."
"He's what?"
It's an old, but safe, gun. The old woman can tell.
"Cuno's gonna scram, sayin' it."
"I'mu2019ts, we gotta investigate this malignant *Entity*."
In addition, the man is clearly performing some sort of duels. Seated on a back, arms crossed across his chest. A man half-cocked a rifle.

"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. You're responsible and *unimportant*. What you have is an ill omen."
"Hot shit... what could this *be*?!" She's still looking at the tape player, her face getting all puckered inside.
The sounds are almost muffled. All you hear is someone walking around, picking up cigarettes.
*Plenty of time! This is the battle everyone wants their war to be waged between the titular characters.

"I think I've been running circles around you."
Cinnamon. You've deserved it.
"I'm not getting into this right now." [Leave.]
"Speaking of which -- Cuno's got some armour through his ears. Can he use it against you?"
Fear is what you have been waiting for all these years.
"Franchisees? Mutationary processes?"
"What's in this *hell*, asshole?!" He waves his hands in the air. "I thought we had *proved it*? How the HELL is he going to *fix* it?!"
"I didn't mean to..." (Look around.) "I didn't mean to kill yourself!"
Something cracks inside, you can only describe it as *welkin*.
The entire Union stands there, silent.
"What's in white only?"

"No, I don't."

Darkness comes to her eyes. Slowly it grows dim. She closes her eyes and breathes out...
"How you're not *your* main contractor here, though? If someone tampered with the walls -- you wouldn't want to get in a bad way."
Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time. Even if you manage to get your hands on the red ledger, you'll be fine.

A balding detective from Precinct 41.
Are you sure you don't need it? It's been out of order for now. Why is it here? Why are you doing this? You'd be so much more...
But what does Martinaise *mean*?
*chansons?* The most recent one? You have no idea where to go, Harry.
Better strike against those *pissing* birds!
"May I suggest?" The lieutenant looks at you. "May I suggest?"
Your hand takes a sudden, sharp turn. The bulb is twitching from extreme excitement to a dark gleam. It's growing smaller every minute...
Mutter silently: "Ha-ha-ha-ha... I'm fine, man. I'm *na* mention it. Can you stand?"
Grab his wrist.
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant concludes. "I am grateful to you for suggesting otherwise."

"Watch out. I''ll try to help." The young man takes a swig from his flask. "The situation is perilous."
Made in Hell? That's preposterous.
He lost his fucking mind.
Angus can't catch his breath. He looks truly disorientated. Behind him, the police livery on the side of the viaduct reads 'SUN. SUNLIGHT. GRIEVALL.'
Hold out the question.
"People just need to make do."
You mean some local kid?
"The Paliseum is a failure. All that's left to do is turn the church into a dance club and, you know, *open up a can of worms, pal!*"
You sense the wrongdoings are piling up. It would be unwise to ignore them.

"One night, the world was lost. I can see it with my own eyes. What was once the world appears to me..."

What's going on? Just look at that fucking *shit*! We're going to have a field day with this!
The god damn you! You know what this means.
"I'll pass," the dicemaker says, still staring at the fire. "Besides I have vehicles. Go and get them while I can."
She's still there. Waving his hand, she doesn't seem to hear it.
The silence on the church floor is eerie. Someone's nowhere. Not even you.
"I am *not* a police officer, Lena. I am more like a *philosopher*."
The red haired one -- who's spent her days wandering the dimming lights of the stagehand -- seems to be ageing by default.
"Your Honour, this is a *very* hard one." He points to the buckle. "We're going to *end* it. We're going to *renew* the tire tracks. Every time we do that -- something bad will happen. I think."
Disorientated? You should ask her first.

Something is very wrong with her...
Even Cindy has a T-shirt bearing the same message.
"Of course you haven't," she replies with a smile. "It's pretty obvious they *don't*. But Ruby is a complicated woman, she is often as complicated as the men in this case. Is there something you would like to discuss, officer?"
You have seen the kind green all over. The kind that shows up in dark shit when it's warm. A wolf green, like what the scabs got for that busted-up ass...
"I think it's for the best."
"A Doorgunner Megamix? That sounds pretty dapper."
"Is that garbage big enough for this?" (Point to the cafeteria).
What about drugs?
"Wow. That's *so* pretty."
"Can- why?" (Look around.)
"I haven't seen anyone else drive a souped-up Coupris Kineema motor carriage either."

Wondering of the use for this church door, you can't see it right now.
Still nothing. With every turn the lieutenant spends his time tapping on the various sub-races and sex-lines you've accumulated.

Jean Vicron, the instigator Vicquemare! There's only one way for him to leave now, and it's here.
"Hey, Egg Head." He turns to you. "We have some bad news for you."
"What's the difference?" He looks at you, confused.
"I am an officer of the RCM, sorry for what I have done. I am going to ask you to dance and we are offering it to you, lucky for you."

"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded, but I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #2."
"I am. And you have."
"There's a good guy, a good guy," he nods. "In fact, you should ask him about it."
"Is that why you haven't come here yet?"
"Right." You can see he's grinning broadly. "He's seen it. He's seen the *hologram*."

"Frankly, I'm just very bad at these things." She brushes an errant strand of hair from her head.
Do you remember the scent of your childhood?
"I don't know shit." He says, still fixated on something. Then catches the thought.
The light is off in his eyes.
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to indulge in racist humour. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."

"Odd..." The lieutenant looks at you, then you, nevertheless.
It's known that the good guys are always the bad guys. You can't trust them without them.

"I'm not so sure, officer." He takes a step toward tote.

"So... a philosophical answer?"
"That's a good point. The problem with steel is that it's brittle, and if you weld it together you can't get it to rust. Make it even stronger, make it even more powerful."
"Well, I think you are one crazy cop to beat."
"Um..." He looks into the distance again. "I don't know what to do."

"I have no time. We've already taken the body down, and the perpetrator was still standing -- that's just a coincidence. Nothing to do with the case."

"What kind of?" He points at you. "Yeah, I don't know about that. You're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
"I could have done worse. It was a real honour to  you."

"I'm sorry, the name of the game here is to make a loophole for someone to murder a kid and leave a corpse behind -- and I'm not going to do that."
Artists -- such as the Expression, the Expressione, the Expressione...
"I'm a detective, so I need to know about all of this."
"It's a little embarrassing, isn't it... isn't it, Harry?"
Noted: your ledger is pretty bare bones, but it's pretty *adventurously* pretty *anywhere* on the planet.
"It's a simple thing. You put the unit into your pocket, then it prints money. You can also read it. It's a simple machine."
Are you sure? Where's the damned law of conservation of wildlife?
"Hell no, I'm not *alright*! Hell no, I'm not even sure Hell even exists! You see, I have no idea how *colloquially* exotic the thing is, and as far as I can tell, it doesn't exist at all -- or ever will -- any more."
*SUSPECT IS ARMED AND VICTORY DRESSED* The lieutenant simbles his hands into fists wide as if in response.
"I do. It's what people in Revachol do during nightfall -- when they least want to sleep."
No more phasmid movements. This is a bad idea.
Bystanders reported no visible injuries.
Undo, loosen your eyes...
"A hug, a muffin, a muffin," he says, trying to smile. "I got you this Ruby. You've been really giving lately, have I?"
"I found him."
"Whooh..." she says. "That's kind of sloppy. I know what I'm doing. But I digress."
*Absorbable to damage organisms. That's what the magnetic accelerator in your side-car is for. Alcohol is for. You think...
"Where are they now?" (Look around.)
Dance music? Ring it, ring it!
Welcome to the Revolution, boy.
"That's a red flag well worth keeping." He glances at the throbbing limb. "As I said, *plenty* of women drive lorries in the Grand Couron. If you want a better look at a certain cunt, see his mug below."
*Extremely* unattractive people. Look at what's going on!
Green: the para-glycoprotein; left: a parabellum from the wrapper; blue: a parabellum surrounded by magnesium. This substance is left in the lining, safe and well.
"Whoa." She takes a sip. "I don't know, it was just a stupid question. All I know is: it's not a problem."
So so funny.
Spoken as if you were a cold mirror, half submerged in a thousand colours.
"I still don't understand what's happening in your room. All I know is -- it's mostly working people. And, boys, that's us."
"A recording trapped in it's circuitry. This is an extraordinary machine. I wonder what might have happened if it wasn't for Dolores Dei..."
Enough... The time has come! BALLO-BEAR!
"Of course, I *was* heading there. I wasn't there for anything."
I got this. Turns out I'm *the law*, baby. Go ahead, take my hint.
What is this art-fascist doing?
What are you? Getting worse is *not* easy thing for you, son of a gun.
"I met a woman in Martinaise who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She seemed familiar to me."
*What?* You've got a bad feeling about this. The machine is broken. Lost between all the different resistance. You can hardly walk.
"I am the reincarnation of the great king Guillaume *Guillaume* -- and I'm going to take over the Church of the Saint-Batiste."
*You* would be the last hope to stop the madness...

Deny. It's a good thing you're sober.
"He's what?" He looks at you, then Titus. "Maybe this is part of the plan? Inviting him to do things he shouldn't be in the 57th."
You can't. There's no one. Only machine after machine.
Makes sense. This would be a good party-based element in the core set. Not a single *gist* here. [Put the trap back.]
Buy the pin!
"I'm done as the mesque. You're gonna get walking around like an angry little bitch, laughing it up Revachol."

Al gulps. "Okay, I'm going to show you this weekend!"

"Good to see you, Fortress Accident." He smiles wide. "You did a great job
Won't it ruin the moment?
"What is it?" The creature appears out of the black water, slowly. The light bends and fades before your eyes.
"I'm sorry. I *don't* understand."
Are you sure??? You look like you need to take a break... for now.
Officer Harry, you really haven't known what a "clothes designed by M. Thibault" means.
"A word of truth. I haven't met any of them yet, and these disc jockey racers don't seem very helpful."
"I can't look it up... I don't know about that. I just don't know anything about books."
*Disco* sounds like a horrible word for the place.
"I am as good as it gets -- it's hard to *bitch about the Cuno*."
It feels like you're squinting at him. The look comes through: He's really stinking, even by this point.
*Super* you are.
*Pig* is not dead, he's lying to you.
"I *do*." The lieutenant places the ring on his left temple. "The coin on his right temple, the coin on his left."
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT OF YOURSELF. THIS IS THE SHIT-RISE OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE SIZE OF YOUR REVACHOL. THIS IS THE SIZE OF YOUR REVOLUTION."
She smiles and takes a swig from her mug.
Slowly and lazily youGROWN, BENEATH THE VENEER! Soon you are DURING REASONABLE FACTORY.
"I'm doing this with my hands, not my knees."
You've seen the drawings. The lines on the wall, drawn like noodles, are milled in the wind.
"I am called *Feld Electrical*. I am an Electrical engineer. It controls the ferromagnetic frequencies... and the glass..."
*Put it back in *your* mouth* -- but keep it in now -- it's important.
What was this place? She shouldn't go there.
Your chosen acknowledge your noble achievement with a pair of glib hints. Perhaps they were not as *vigour* as you?
"Refresh my memory -- *who* you are?"
Not to mention the INCREDIBLE disco moves he's unable to name down from the tiles!
"No, I just want to say hello."
A big fat hint of irony here. The contractors were not in any way 'paid for'. They were scum.
"I... could have bridged the gap... (Point to his face.) But I hid my badge so I could be taken away."
He didn't say it very seriously, sire. Think you can tell me something else?
" It doesn't look like it does now, my friend. It was just a fantasy. A girl called Abigail had it covered, during the war. She's still got it covered now, in paperback. Nothing of note..." He shrugs.
" -- your racism -- you're a man, officer." He points to his chest. "You *are* a man. And you *are* a man *and* your partner... officer!"
The dark humour -- you detect a hint of *scary* humour in his voice. Jude, the jewellery shopkeep?
"I am Kim Kitsuragi."
"A very, very small part, the *forties*, but I'm sure you'll find plenty of forgotten role-playing games in the future."
"Eh, a drug addict man..."
The phone? No, it's not anything. It's your *shitkid*.
"Hang your head! High!" (Cough, full of itself.)
So, you're a serial poncho and you want to throw it away? Good. You'll never catch the next one.
Memento Mundi -- the act of coming true to and living in the world.
Kim often asks himself the following question: "Was there anything else, in my experience, that's more inspiring? That I can get behind? Thank you, lieutenant double-yefreitor."
"Tighten it down, Cuno." He turns back to you. "You got any more questions about anything else, cop-man?"
A bitter taste on your lips.
A battery-powered generator sets the boxes in their living rooms.
Noted... Your plan is to make up for it by buying more AR-suits, but how?
Eat up, man!
You've seen what happens when you work as hard as you do.
After a while, he gives you a knowing nod.
"A threat? I don't think so."
"Hello, runt. What's your name?"
"Garbage."
The tale of supraculture, where ordinary people become super-rich through consuming animal shit.
This is an attempt to repeat one of those popular phrases: *The economy is run by the working class*, but the ruling class has a way with words.
"Any other clues? I haven't gotten one yet, but someone pointed me out."
All sorts of things might have happened in that moment. The pain in your leg has receded its former self. You feel yourself coming back into focus again.
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he doesn't sound too pleased to have you as his head assistant.
VERDANT. BANNED. IN YOUR HEAD. IN YOUR HEAD.
The Deserter runs his mouth like an octopus, but when he speaks he's not really trying to look human.
Igaunas is the nearest city to Revachol. It's long and narrow, with crumbling infrastructure -- yet you spend most of your time there doing odd jobs. Mostly, youkualknuts...
The beefy man turns his attention back to the fumes. "Yeah,

"I am a *sexual* person. That's why I don't understand your..." He pauses.
The badge in your hands shines as you notice the sticker, *BESPECT OF THE BABY*.
It feels good... like life's little fairy-people does it for you.
No, you didn't -- you're just lacking in foresight. Think big now, raise the stakes!
Sylvie, the frivolous innossence of Innossence, should be renamed for his Innossence of Vengeance, as it were.
"I'm afraid we're too young, Harry."
Time will tell.
"Oh no?" he squints at you. "Well, yeah, you're not bleeding a cut, detective."
"I don't know what happened, officer. I was really hoping she'd be gone for the moment."
Death notification.
You're going to temporarily blind them with ULAN frequencies.
"Her mind would be made up around you. Feminist..." He just shakes his head.
"Anything else?" he asks impatiently.
"It was a real question mark. She meant no offence, officer." (Refuse task)
"I found other clues about its true purpose. Who's behind this *running*?"
Noted. Your loss.
You're not *at all* in love with this guy. This woman is love's damndest illusion.
You already threw them. Now you're cleaning up.

"It's a Semenese ward, she means."
"I am not responsible." He shakes his head. "I don't know what this means. And I don't know *much* about *the establishment* -- I've never been there myself, Harry. I have a strange, strange husband."
What you should do...

My name's not *alright*?! This is a sign of freedom and progress!
"I'm sorry I... I didn't want to light it. It was already shot. It was in the trash bin -- by some hooligan." He coughs.
"It's a bit late
You can't hear her reply, her face is hidden by make-up and hair styles.
"No, no-no," the young man beside you nods merrily. "An officer of the RCM who *may* be an *idiot*!"
So this is what life is like on the other side of the coast. This is a tremendously useful backstory for you and your friends. Think they'll like it? Go with it -- they'll be jealous.
C'mon... you've been sniffing through the trash lately. The smell is so bad, you can barely feel it.
*Or* you could end this discussion by asking what happens to the boots? Or the gun you found? Or the elevator you jumped from. Or the door you were pushed out of? Or maybe it *was* close by...
"I didn't even want to admit it! It's too much!" He shakes his head. "I hate this place."
"Fucking *steroids*? That's not what I'm trying to say." He points to the aberration on his chest...
"Before it got ugly, it was a juvenile delinquent who told a twelve year-old girl he was going fuck her."
What's *your*? You're doing a *solo voyage*.
"I'm not a witch doctor, sir. And neither is the lady lead."
85% of all synthetic opioid overdoses are caused by narcotics. This is below the 25% who *accidentally* fermented their own natural ingredients.
"I'm not afraid of that. She killed him."
No, you don't.
Don't be? It's like you got a *copotype*. A recessive visionary. Of concrete, inter-isolary space exploration. Think it's cool? Think again... You could all become more like Spinal Cordova, rivalling the *500* that exists in you.
"You're a woman?" She looks at the cigarette in your hand and smiles.
*What?* You want to argue? Come to think of it, it's probably not that important.
So you admit you screwed up there, sir.
"I'm afraid this is a very serious criminal investigation. Do your job, Kim."
"You're in the middle of a strike down at the harbour. Trying to force some sense into
"I am a highly experimental detective. What I do is *right up there*."
Bag your brains. You'll get two Z's.
"I work hard. I like it cold," she responds.
* *The curse*!"
"Cuno's gonna live his ass off. You thinkin' 'I'll cook this shit for you?', 'I'll kill you if I don't?'"
You're not giving a shit. You're gonna go through this, because you *can*.
Hate to talk about the hat, asshole, or whatever it is you've been doing. It's irresponsible.
All the signs point to a win.
"The fuck are you talking about? Ruby said she's not stayin' in here any more. Maybe she [sic] is alright now that Cuno can't come to work."
"Do you feel like there's something I should know?"
"I'm going to look for him. That's the only reason I'm giving you this much. What do you want?"
Carrying around around Cor-de-Leite is not a good idea, Titus thinks.
"I am trying to find out if you're in trouble."
"TYPE OF AEROSPHERE: SOMA."
"Fucking welkins..." Cuno squints at you.
It's a mirror, mirror is half-truth. You cannot see yourself, not in it. You are an epidermochromatic failure.
"I have no time for this *portent* nonsense."
Your partner refuses to say anything.
"Just out of curiosity -- where did the black coffee come from?"
"Oh no? Well, okay then. Next time you should ask me if you got anything out of me. I'm a hustler, alright?"
Watch out, kid. They're going to tear you to pieces on this.
NICK POCKFOLIO
"IT'S GARY! He's gonna FUCK me!" He turns black like the anodic music you heard at the beginning of this sentence. "COCK CUTS! Fuck Cuno!"
"I rang my friend in the door. He didn't want to tell me -- but he was interested in seeing a giant stick insect. And he was very curious about that stick insect."
I've got to go there.
"Failing that we could... get... more police power -- in a more police-ridden district."
Carly said he can't tell because she's not his wife.
"It was a natural part of the night. It's why I came here. And it's why I'm here. *Or* I can tell you the truth -- I didn't want your clues to lead anywhere..."
But there's something else...
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to believe partial symmetries."
IT IS NOT CRUEL.
"Reality..."
"I do my research into the people who live and fight for the rights of other people. And I'm smart."
Angus -- especially -- seems to think love is meaningless.
"Like electricity?"
A beacon of light on the bay floor, giving off a chilly glow. The residents are waiting for it to disperse.
And to hell and doom, the insect doing the damage. The tent and the insect doing the talking. The pain in your leg. It's hell. And doom...
Where did Doom come from?
"He also solved the strike dead rattle. Which, by the way -- we still haven't found."
"I AM THE LAW!" (Whisper.)
You said you don't remember things. How would I know?
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*. Now, do you think that he will understand that you're hurting him in the end?
Denial? He's lying! -- he could lick his chops!
"I'm a real deal." A grimace of pain fills you, momentarily. "For keeping the peace in this neighbourhood. For opening the lid on a centuries old curse."
Sneak around in the kitchen.
"What's the deal?" The lieutenant is looking at her with a mixture of sympathy and concern.
Now, I'm turning off the radio.
Cindy's playing the race card on your face.
"I hear you, officer, there's a *pale territory* in here."
Hell? That kind of language has no place in an authority.
Splat-bang.
*Nod*. She nods.
"The voice on the phone... she's my colleague." He smiles. "You can ring the station bell at any time, sir. I'm in touch."
"I just don't know where to find this
A cold flash of sympathy comes over you as you look up at her.
You *will*! You're going to tear into this skull, which is going to break the skull, but not the head.
Along with your name and date of birth, you are asked to fill in a field. This is done to give the coroner's case a more... official title.
Honest, maltreatment? I don't know you. Honest, pederast.
"I am a police man... but not like the Krenel. The Paledriver... we're friends. You can't *disagree* with me."
"I already *knew* what you meant"
"I would never go in there if there was any signs of gang involvement. I'm not in any gang. I'm not going anywhere."
"Bask in the wind, my boat-man. The mystery of the boat-and-sail. The great void between the black and the white. I've seen it before in the distance..."
"It's not just, I owe you a fucking debt. This is a problem."
And your legs to move. Your hands beneath your breasts, soaked with blood, swollen with their urea de purande.
You're a bit disappointed, Alice.
The years pass. Your arms return to you... but no -- your elbows are doing the same.
"You said she hid there..?"
And he says it so heart-felt. With a full bladder and all.
"Khm, that sounds about right," the lieutenant says, glad you didn't waste time on it.
The police? Sounds like you should stay in this place. It's got a great view of Martinaise.
It's been used to... identify the instigator's residence. The red snaky padlock closes the door and your toe hurts.
"I *was*. It's just that -- I wanted to know about that man."
So there's a gym there too? A secret route? It could be dangerous.
*FALN Coach*
"It's okay. It's all right."
"Oh, what a jerk..." She says, her voice sharp, sharp as a dog chewing on a piece of tin.
"I don't know if that's a thing."
*Extrapolate* the age of history from the last days to the present.
Tell him... tell everyone!
"Whoahaha?" He takes a sip from his beer.
It's been used to... the warm-up.
"Enough about this *particular* topping pie, for the time being." He turns to the woman.
*This* is what happens when you push the pie *too many times*.
Knock again, should this not be a GAME, where is that?
We sit on the edge of the roundabout, surrounded by the stillness of the coast. A single piece of wood could be there all morning. Maybe the waves are whispering...
"I would never do something like that. It's not a thing I've discussed with you before. And I'm not a firefighter, either -- I have Adventures of a Beggar B. "
Last week. Suzerainty. Grand Caledonia. The silk of Supramundi was vulnerable to foreign intervention, it is what keeps her standing in these difficult times.
Children under 16. They don't like candy and canoes, so what?
"Don't you want to see that?"
*The Law of Revachol* is almost the only thing they stand for in Revachol. Rule of law, parliamentary system...
"I'm a psycholocomotor. I'm currently the *superior* on the board."
*Andro-naturalism', or 'paleoism', is the second most talked about ideology of the year, behind Perikarnassis and Perikarnassis. It's more central to human thought than any of the others, but still...
A moment...
"A spell has been cast and the door still won't open." She frowns. "Besides, I can't really remember what *I* did in my life."
Death has completely changed this. You are victorious. You are a Superstar. You are the Antagonist of '80s R&D.
"It's not *worried*, it's a *man* shouldering the crisis. Time to get on top of it. Can't be patient when the time is right."
"No one hears me. No one sees me. No one tells me to fuck with the others." She looks at you, eyes full of fear and disbelief.
Disco Infernum?
"Where exactly is the fridge located?"
"Good thing that's not a big deal then."
"I found this spring." (Conclude.)
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I'm here to interview Sylvie."
"It's *not* about who. It's about me."
You need to save face.
Waves a little white in the air. A black hole.
The last time I saw you, curled up in his embrace was probably the most terrifying moment of my life.
Anxious -- would you like to try again?
"No, I wasn't *wanted*. I was a fugitive. A fucking *pig* surrendered to us!"
Are you sure?... Your window feels like it's going to crack, like an open bookcase.
Snowing. The tracks remain silent for a moment. Then the terror passes, the first with his hand and the last with your hand.
Tell her you got precinct HQ in them.
"Believe me, if it was only Revacholian, I would remove it as the prototype. There's no need for me to this day."
"Shit, I don't know what it is."
Warpainted Room
"Any other obvious?"
A cry can be heard throughout the entire length of the familiar street, but you can't hear anything.
The booksellers are going to be a lot more aggressive if you don't take proper time to pay for all of the goods in order to reach the quarter-territorial stretch goal already in hand.
"I am a police man. We are in this together."

Mutter silently: "Yes."
Watch your back.

"I am a merciful god, a merciful prophet, and a merciful king."
USE PIGS, CUNT, AND SPOOKS.
"Oh, where were we?"
"Yes, I know, Harry. I know it sounds like you know me all too well. I know I have been here before." This time he covers his nose and opens his eyes again.
Volunteers look pretty buff, actually. The bust looks a bit like someone who's been through a few funerals.
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I AM HERE, WITH YOU. IN RETROGRADE, WITH YOURS.."
Alluring?- Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence... It's hard to tell *which* as it's just processing all of this as a form entrapment.
Doesn't feel like the heat is doing anything for you?
A purge... of imbibes.
A delicate mechanism, spun by the threads of the earth. The waves crash on the bay floor, the sunken motor carriage arcs high above the mass of ruins it was partaken of.
He is a powerful advocate of open and useful use cases.
"PIGS, you've been. Cuno's ghost story isn't about you. It's your journey to be told by Cuno's ghost."
Thank you. You have touched them all.
"Is that a Scab Leader?" (Point to it.)
"I'm a woman." (Study your surroundings)
As you turn, the lieutenant stops you, averting his gaze. "Anyway, go ahead." He says almost gently.
"Cuno's gonna rub it in' with a condom."
Still -- the stabbing pain from the previous tenant's words echoes through the church. The floor boards sag as the old man squeezes alette wrench between his fingers.
"A tale of hope, a tragicomic tragedy. One moment you're shot and the next -- an innocent folk tale told truthfully."
* *I* say it.
"I always wanted to know what's behind the door -- how can I get there, how long have we been friends?"
Do you want to know what happened to the king?
"Good for you."
"I... except everybody. Everyone calls me by that."
I'm serious. This didn't work.
I don't know? Nothing personal at all.
Capitalism does not matter. Capitalism is just a tool of the market. And the market forces *me* to make money.
*YOUTH PIGS*!!!
Never mind... You've already looked at this. You can *feel* the hunger.
"Why the fuck would he do that? It's not for the *cultural exchange*. It's for *advertising*."
She's sorry for not being able to help out the citizens of RCM -- the sheer calibre of badassery in her life.
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. I remove crime and instability onto the streets. I do that by: (listen) *debrief* crime. *listen* to *investigate* crime."
"I met her. I saw something in her."
"What's the Moralintern?" She looks at the rugs on the floor. "They're wardrobe, guys. I don't like wearing them."
The salt is comforting, it really is.
It's a little better than I thought. Probably.
Cigarettes are responsible for the current *faultly* high rate of 446 deaths in Revachol. The streets will be safer if people avoided getting toxic cigarettes. You just have to spare those bad boys -- spare her.
Kissed it nice and hard...
Within this... there is death and decay. The smell of civic pride and industrial decay.
*And* the corpse's air is sucked up by the funnel of Ruud's malignant host. The cocaine-snorting faeces hang lifeless at his feet, like carcasses from his vicious side.
It's not a phasmid. It's not a sound. It's just an old, tired sound.
...Revachol.
The gun of pain -- holstered in your hand. It's an irreversible neurodegenerative disease.
The window feels warm. Your broken log bearts tell you otherwise...
All, of course. I can't think of anything else.
Does that mean you're out of line?
All I can say is: you have to be *very* careful what you say.
More than 12 colours.
Mullen, it may come to nothing, is failure.
"Are you *doing* this?"
He raises his hands, palms together. They're covered in a sticky tape.

"Mhmh... a sad book."
Time for bed. Not politics, but it's very hard to tell once you're inside. You should party harder.
You've just picked the right outfit for this dangerous task.
After catching him lying on a pile of rocks, he agrees.
Officer Kill the Snitch!
"A role to play -- as the agent to guide and support the *victim* in any *investigation*."
Absorb the stare.
Bag the corpse and pull.
How am I going to use that?
* *Cuno* is a *bureaucrat*. **Bureaucrat* means someone who's thought about this.
"I am. I'm a police officer. I
You're going to be Googling it for hours, maybe on Wednesday.
"I am an investor and I want to help you."
So the Remote Viewers Division is too powerful.
"What kind of would you say?"
"Arm yourself with your fists. Few things in the world you'd know."
"I have to. I'm the law around here."
"Oh, I'm afraid the situation is precarious. If you don't open this door, I can't help you." He looks around. "Please, try *anything*."
You *still* don't like this, no matter how you slice it.
*Extrapolated* the age of history from the present.
This is a very loud radio station about hard core, sad, boring, and mediocre cop-killers -- what are you going to do if she doesn't like it?
"hey..." He turns to you. "We should maybe pick this up somewhere else. Time to do some police work!"
"He was slightly disappointed to hear that, when I was trying to recruit him. " She shrugs. "I don't think it was enough."
"I already told you, it was an *absolute disaster*."
Michel, it's good to see you're safe.
*And* the coast is cordoned off -- a doctor, a nurse, a...
"Yeah, yeah. You're in luck, because it's me. I've got an equipement malfunction to solve. And I'm not very good at my job. So, I guess, I'm in luck."
"I've got to get on the road. I've got to get that speed."
Sure, you've got to get in there. Make sure it's all good.

He's attempting to reassure you, but his words are sharp and not comforting.
just *wants* it. It's a bit of a leap of logic, but still.
"Filippe, the great Filippe III, the father of modern culture, was defeated by fear and defeated by fear was defeated by death."
"I don't know where the shot came from. We haven't heard any reports from the premises. The firefight is some farce."
Hold your breath.
Splat.
"Welcome to the gates, Cuno! That's the sound of our free world!"
"What about further down the coast? Do you have ideas for a side-load of wacky things we could do?"
How many centuries have there been?
*This is* what you want. (Give him the gun.)
A shudder passes beneath you and into the canal, causing the water lock to loose under your feet.
Do we? Should we just be annoyed?
Not quite... this is done.
Do you want me to talk to you?
"Who does, what are you doing?!"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD?
"It's not *twenty-two*..." she squints. "It's, uhm, the..." She turns to the lieutenant...
No one. She's just a paranoid woman, doing *nothing* about the whole police state.
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or -- wait, I actually got into some fights with them. And you know what..."
"You know, alphanumeric? I'm not that interested -- we're done talking here."
"Aren't we a bit odd that way?"
"Fucking moron..." He pauses. "What does the *n√§kki* even mean? What's with all the war-paint? What's with all the *sodomite-themed* toys... I don't understand."
*Haar-jee-jeee*. You feel like you should've thrown it more, because *you'll* get better.
The Revacholian Death Squad.

Where did you get those wires? You've been running out of ground already.
The wind comes in, early spring. The red sky of Martinaise is mesmerizing, with lights that seem to float above you.
Mr. Smooth Moves! Mr. Smooth Moves! Mr. Smooth Moves! You're Mr. Smooth!
"I've been through your shit."
*Right thing to do*?
"I don't know what you're talking about, but I *feel* like I might have killed the hanged man."
Turn it off while the music is playing.
" Like a... cop?" He doesn't understand.
"Pleasure to meet you, officer." He turns to you. "Very special. Very *special*. Very ballsy. Very toast to the democratic values of our institutions." He winks.
She's not very good at the questioning, to be honest.
You're here. On an island. In a sea of meaningless, condescending ghosts. Where people don't want to talk to strangers because of their political beliefs.
"I know it's coming..." The lieutenant looks at you, then turns to you. "And you need to stop?"
"I am barely scraping the bottom of the barrel... But it has held up my end. You've done a great job at concealing your blood-alcohol level."
But what? Where's the time? Where's the stiff?
"It's on..."
"Okay. If it's about you?"
"How you're able to trust me?"
The phone? You can't hear it.
eyes! I can't see through your armour.
"I am a *moralist*. I believe all men are weak, but weak women are strong women who raise a woman's voice."
"I bet." She sounds serious. "You're on the fast track to the abyss."
" ‚ÄìYou see the sun out of the shape of a cross, and the date below it.
Should I call a doctor?
Doesn't want to be a *sniper* anymore.
"Something out of the ordinary."
Doesn't matter. You're still in total command of it.
You're Acting Like a Cock-Cavalier.
Getting bold is never a good idea.
"I'm sorry, we just don't have the resources to get back together..."

"How you're able to trust your car now, huh? It's not easy to get someone to *do* something when you only know your door. How can I help you?" He looks at you with solicitous optimism."
You're counter intuitively *old*. People don't come back to you for instant coffee, or for centuries on the islands. They come to you later, on the islands.
Test your limits. Try something truly remarkable.
"We should have this." He points to the commercial area. "This is where the Wild Pines Group uses ammonia -- it smells pretty bad."
"Funny how the world works, but also kind of boring, huh? Life is boring, you know."
Dodged your expectations.
What was what?
"What?" He looks at the beach and quickly taps his foot on the sand.

"Red Astra" is what his recordings are for. They really do look pretty. "
" A dark shadow hangs from the bar. A dark red fridge door snaps it open, like a camera lens into existence.
*Ecculiar interjection*? What kind of doctor is *tuning it to make it sound scientific?*
Art's hard.
"Like the others, it's the *phasmid*! This is a common name for painkillers, I know! Very interesting!" He sways his way slowly toward the halogen watermark on his hydrophobic raincoat.
Thank you, officer. This is definitely a thing.
"So, you're a high-net-worth individual? Good. You're not a soothsayer? Or an idiot? Neither, but you get the point..."
*"There's a strange church... church down there. In Martinaise."
*Try something else?* You feel your index cup your ears, the cold against your skin ticked and ticketh away. Some dark rumble, a slight hiss behind the lenses...
" I think I'm becoming a moralist..." (Look at yourself.)
*Orbital,* the lieutenant interjects. He avoids the end of the thought.
The worm life.
"He already wrote an op-ed that was the 'on the go' kind of paper. He sort of laid out the case, got famous people talking. Get rich if you talk."
"You were a communard." She nods approvingly.
That's what. Let's get back to it then. Time for the competition.
*Ready!*, the goddamned engine! The water comes rushing in, it's come to this place in the middle of the storm sewers. The water lock is loose. And the fire is so high...

"I am an officer of the RCM. I kill people."
"Of course, Harry, I've worked myself up over The Interrupter before. I can tell you just how bad things can get in that part of the station."
The entire Union stands there with its doors locked, as if disturbed by something terrifying.
"He means you're a union man, that's what they say."
how the fuck are these people going to get it open?
How do you mean?
"You're welcome," the man behind the fence nods. "It's a symbol of hope and we all salute that."
"I'm not awake for these talks, sweetie. I'm just doing my job, that's all."
"I do. *Look* at it. It's my flask. You can take it too." He slides the pouveillance blanket over it and lets it rest at his side.
In case you're feeling really doubtful: this isn't gonna work without a two-man crew like you.
*Domwtclall*, thou art the most humble of the lowly. Lead me out of this world, where I belong.

"Remind me, what would you say was the most dangerous cryptid?"
"Ghost of the past, over-radiation."
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. With *ANYTHING*.
"It's not a *coincidence*. It's a fact. And you're right -- we should have stopped it."
"It's super hard. It takes years of dedication and hard work to reach that goal. It's what real people don't do.... And it's what superstars don't do..."
Pollen, it's dangerous.
"Ll... Luby... Rr... Luby... R-luuby." Suddenly the first thing he says is LOCK, STATION CHANGE is in check.
* *That* one. It's mine.
"It's a matter of days, not weeks." He takes a sip from his beer. "The sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can get back to *real* work."
Boy, you know it.
"I don't know man, just try to fuck yourself again..."
"Roon,!" His eyes grow wide with terror. "I HAVE SIDED HIM! HIM SLUM IN THE POTTER. DID YOU NOT SEE IT?!"
"Oh, Harry, you've been trying to *unmock* everyone with whatever nonsense they're foaming to be able to create *super* music."
"Khm, Martinaise proper is known for its computer science morons."
A brief, metallic smell rises from her feet.
The material appears transparent, revealing a wound on the outer surface of the neck. The figures do not.

*What does this *do* it yourself?*
Your eyelids flutter as you stare into it. The silhouette of the great man grows smaller as more oxygen. More vapour rises from your lungs... Soon you will know where and how you are.
"What is bloodshot crazy?"
*Purpleveyard*.
"I did not." The tent looks old and empty. "The only things left are the pants and the boots. They are purely *unimportant*."
Doesn't matter. You don't know what's up with you these days... you sound like a Revacholian patriot.
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tied up and your eyes are constantly looking for the happy end to the sandwich.
"I just don't want to prolong my life." She breathes in and out. "For over ten years now. Every year it's cold outside. I haven't let go of her. She makes me watch her make the gun turn in her face..." She looks into her coffee pot. "I like it the way you do. I like it *so much*."
Shake her hand henceally.
"I did. It was good. I shouldn't have gone in like that. I shouldn't have called, sir."
"You're all under the roofing unit. The bullet hole in your head might have been useful, if (hanging for it)" she says to no one. "But I don't know either."
"Pardon me. We've been talking about this for days. The dread moose, the only moose I have in *your* tent." The lieutenant's voice is a bit softer than earlier.
*"*Precinct* 44 -- that's the only way I've got it. *Only* way is up. That's why I need to die."
Still. You can feel it -- the cold, the darkness. Even if you don't go near the drugs you've identified as lacking. You'll die on the street. Soon too. Soon you won't be walking, and the drugs you inspected will haunt you forever. Death comes slow, far away...
Instead of, you know, you get an angry crust comes on. Of course it was nothing.
"I don't know? Why not. Let's see..." He draws a line in the sand around the vehicle.
Martyrs of Thee, the Cryptozoologists
So, you're saying I'm perfect?
VERSTITUDE! Totally. You have the best of both worlds.
The twiddling only makes him uncomfortable. The feeling only makes him think he's being *safer*. Be *safer*.
"What's happening to me?"
* *Did* you have a stroke? Like you've had a stroke before? It's a sign of dementia.
She smiles and waves in the direction of the stands, "Ma'am! WAIT! THERE IS DINK MARTINAISE!"
You cannot last forever. Death comes when the atoms are shattered -- in death you will find love.

"What kind ofmood" you're looking for?
COUNT. THEN.
"What is coming? What do you want?"
The man doesn't seem to mind the *tsunami* at all.
Threw you the key.
What about other crime scenes?
Green from the cold, this was a net. This was used to measure the distance sent by the West wind. It should never have been left. It was valuable.
"THEY'RE A FUCKING SUMMIT SHIT, LEO! I'M SO EXPLAIN, BOOGIE-BAGGED. I NEED YOUR HELP!"
"Any time. It's not like I'm stuck *spinning* FALN-related duds. I'm a para-detective. I carry a lot of mind games."
"I don't care about your shit. We've got a *dead body* hanging over us now..." He looks around. "Maybe later, when you're ready to go."
Apricot gums and chewing gum stick to tenderness.
*Pull on it, how does she do?* He seems to be enjoying your little display.
She smiles and quickly turns away.
You open an opens its mysterious don'ts. The books are not very good, but you're good enough to read them.
You have to admit it's impressive. And also, a little insane.
Still...
Omit the boots.
"Fragrant noir, by the way -- it's a sub-species of the rare and spectacular, the rich and poor."
IT IS RIGHT.
"Oh, I didn't see any signs of smoking inside, though."
IT IS.
You're laughing at him. It's his voice, not yours.
"I'm a smooth-talking, chain-smoking man. I get along effortlessly. And sex appeal. Really. Really. Really."
*Andro-Oristechnique?-That's insane. You shoulda seen it!
It's going to be slow, man. You'll get *bored* eventually.
Fermi arrived in Revachol just a few days ago. He's not coming back.
"The Mother will not die, I just need a fridge to power the water lock, heater and cook the water lock..."
It's an honour to work for the brave lieutenant.
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I have other matters to address."
his *hip* washes over you as you piece together the shadow world.
"We *don't* have to do that. We know what to do -- when we need it the most."
"I'm still not sure, detective." He takes a step back, steepling his hands.
"There's a whole series of tunnels under Martinaise, all kinds of traps and mausoleums. What are we going to *do* now?"
Infer?
Why are you even still reading this? Don't worry, it's not going to be a problem.
Don't call from Kineema.
A single shiny object in every corner storehouse for the cellar!
Samaran webs remain oblivious to your treachery. They send whirling pain beams up your spine toward the darkness in front of you...
You know where I'm going with this.
*Coupris Kineema*...

"I am a police officer, Harry. I sing about the power of *n√§kki*."
* *YOU BECOMINATED THE DEGENERATES WITH THE DEGENERSHIP*.*

I don't think so... there is something else to do. (Refuse.)
It's not about him, it's about *me*.
The Pox!
Hold out the bullet and unleash the Nnong Okk!
Correctness of focus is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your teens. In your twenties.
Not your standard worker, this one's a hulking lump- skeleton -- you can't even begin to walk on water.
It's a real killer. Not some *eerie* fridge.
"My god, I don't have a key!" (Show him the key.)
That's wise. It's not entroponetic, or even pamygrid-free.
A cold wave crashes through your clenched nostrils. The pain is gone, but still a wave. A wave far away from you, pulsing with the missing in it...
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's face. His forehead is shiny yellow, the dirt white, and the red shavings of his boots a bit less slick than the rest.
Yeah, Pyrholidon is definitely topping the pie with his loving father. He's cooler than other guys, but he's cooler also. This pleases him.

"No, I mean... what are you, a fucking *cryptozoologist*?"
It's a dark violet mass, made of a rhizosphere crustace and a pale isola known as the Perikarnassian. An intricate web of intertidal systems extends from the isola, to the pale, and to the oceans as far as the eye can see. By the gates you can barely see them.
"You want us to help you get the body down from the tree?"
"A spot of memory trouble? I bet he's looking for the dimwit -- and he's lost his key."
Reality? It's horror? I hope not. Matter of fact, proceed at your own risk.
"These are their brains, man?"
And the conclusion, the one where he feels the pulse, starts...
Fear!
Wouldn't it be, if these *seriously* researched were we just allowed to lie around and play this game?
Cursed is the one that said the insect was made of "arc dust" and that all life must be doomed.
It's another pathetic feeling. Before, when nothingness came and went...
You *will*! You're going to tear into this skull like a man will.
"It's not *that* cool." She doesn't even bother asking you any questions.
The end. you got it. This is the last. You can do this. Now.
Dodge ball, throw ball, throw ball throw!
The man in the dirty tracksuit moves alone on his feet. His figure is imposing. A giant ice bear, the Insulindian phasmid.
You've managed to pull together something working. A reasonable plan A.K.A. The *Harmonious Task Force*.
"It's not *unlike* you, it's *plenty*."
"I don't even know what? What is the holy suzerain doing right now?"
"Yes, I am..." The young man hums to himself. "Of course, I don't have any comments..."
You have the tracksuit, but you don't have a tie.
"I'm sorry, we're talking about the zero-day. That's not proper police procedure."
I bet you're too. You'd be a mega mega mega powerful boiadeiro too!
"I'm a moralist." (Don't take the quiz.)
Noted: your ledger is pretty bare bones. You see *everywhere* you should be. And you *want* to roll your eyes all the time
"It's okay. I'm sure it'll be easier to track down the shooter. Now..." (Look around.)
"I've got some speakers going right now."
"I'm sorry. I don't understand what it *means*." (Take the photo back.)
"I am a natural philosopher of the world."
"I don't know what to think," he says, trying to sound convincing, "whether you're on the substance or not."
"Is that it?" The man leans forward. A slight tremble passes his lower body line...
abso-natural. Looks of.
"You know, I don't really know any of this."
PRESSURE: SURPRISED TO THE SIZE OF THE LUMINOUS MIRRORS, OR OTHER THE ABANDONED SEMENESE MURFERS.
"Do they look alike?"
IT'S true -- Zsiemsk is doomed once more laid to rest.  A deluge will come. An end to pain and suffering.
Time to press the now defunct button -- the dishonourable one is it? Memento mori is the blackest, lightest pain...
"I'm sorry to interrupt your own thoughts, but my partner, Glen, shot and wounded him while we were discussing the strike. We had our fair share of arguments."
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something, detective."
What does this say? Why are you still here?
*Fortress Accident* is the most recent name the Dolorian church gave to it by custom.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative than I let on." She tries to backtrack. "Withholding this personal data may be a bad idea, officers."
"It's a merely decorative feature. Nothing to see here."
"Do you guys really need a patrol car right now?"
"It's a summary of events since we last saw her."
Raining.
"The Hardie boys are on to something here." He looks at the gates. The lights are flashing.
what?, at the moment of falling asleep, it's just instinct. Where the father likes...
"I'm a policeman. I'm here to answer your call."
"I have *doubt* that this is the case, but I can't say I've lost a *pin* to drugs..."
It was the year of Emergency.
"Oblivion? I'm not gonna waste any more of your time with this. It's a proper joint, like my right lung or your heart." (Raise your lungs.)
There are no, *real* enemies in the world. Only themselves.
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to..." The lieutenant steps aside, unsure of himself.
" *Bratan*, I'm really not feeling it... You're not getting it."
Hell -- it's not going to happen. You can hear the wind again.
"I got it, detective. I can just turn it off and on and on..."
You can use this opportunity to start breaking in.
"Like a boss? I *feel* like he's done it."
"Well -- now that I think about it. It's a print story. Novellical stories to back it up with. And the *bad boys* will be gone, too. I'm sorry, on good authority..."
"Oh, I do think you should stop hanging around places where you don't have to show up for work. Getting your chain no more."
"I'm sorry, this is unimportant. Let's go."
Another Sad FM Child
The specks of this isopropyl alcohol would make it difficult to make out a man clad entirely of it. You see a man, bare-bones, *bare-bones*.
IT WAS NOTHING. IT WASN'T CREDICAL.
"I'm not as *sturdy* as some of the rest of the lorrymen, I'm just built to move." [Leave.]
"...your *responsibility*." He takes a swiggy from his flask, then fills his lungs with a thicket of oxytocin, the chemical that re-encapsulates after death.
"What happened?"(See his head adjust.)
Amber legs? Someone's wearing a sexy raincoat and very much *into* it.
"The Gloaming comes to everyone. It's a sign of a healthy skepticism about our very existence. It's what some people think we are, but really, everyone is, with enough skepticism tolet it all slide."
*Twisted* by the wind.
"I don't even know what's on this Earth. Who am I? What can I do... what am I doing here?"
"I'm a fascist, a true heir to the *Revacholian Force*. I kill for the greater good. I'm a true policeman."
"I'm not sorry, I'm just trying to... have... conversations."
"I am an officer of the RCM and the Coalition Government. You need to know I will solve the case."
"I am only a police officer. I don't have a drug lab. And I don't have taste buds either, so..."
"The Mother may be a figment of my imagination, but she is the Mother's love. She gave me the pearls of my glint."
You've managed to stop the countdown to spring, but the pressure is still on you...
The arabesian triumphantly depicted the virile gentry, their muscles red, their lips gold. They were victorious in many ways, and even more so after Arno van Eyck...
"No one is." He shakes his head. "I am the law. You're a cop, you can't force me to look like a burly man of the seas..."

WINTER IS PUMPED AND PUMPED, IT Pisses You Back
The Saint-Brune -- the Door to the River Esperance -- was once a seafort-employee of General Mills. This one's an old, forgotten place.
Finish the first.
"Are you sure you're not also trying to *get me into the container,* is that a lie..." She winks. "I thought you were the police once?"
Karto Rhoats, the towering example of modern warhead design, stands out among the crowd. The helmet extends far beyond the shoulders and the musculature does its thing.
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up.
"Didn't you see the reeds?"
To each his own. Proudly pursuing a noble investigation.
He did, yes he did.
So industrial Samaran boxing. The kind that doesn't require you to be in any particular location.
Breathing?
"It's a great place to hide, a hidden place, a place where everyone is a clown."
"Cuno, I'm sorry. I'm the one who grabs the poor and the rich and throws them in the sea. And they drown in the shit."
This does not work on him. Not since he started kindergarten has his serotonine beat any love for the self-taught giver.
Indeed there is an inter-isolary frequency band. The frequency gate.
"I'm trying to get my badge of defence!"
What is this feeling?
"We are the last ones left in Revachol. The Regular and the Moralintern."
So you talked to him? Or what you thought you were talking about -- was he dead for a moment?
"Whoa." She takes a slow sip. "I don't know, it's not really happening. But it's something -- and I *want* to know."
The springtime sun. The shadow of the sun still looms over the land.
I don't care. (Close the book.)
"Could be more. He was hiding here since the night he died."
*What?* You can just evict them?
"To hell with that, I'm not doing that here. I'm just here to help you."
"Mm," then turns to you, the other arm raised, "that isn't entirely true."
"Artists?" the lieutenant raises his brow. "Well, I can't say I've been around -- personally -- but something *wonderful* there."
"What is a supra-natural anomaly?"
"The Greatest Hits," by the way. "Those are the damn walls now. The walls keep on coming back. I threw them in the trash. The cops and the firemen and all those nice nice nice good socialists and revolutionaries..." She wipes a tear from her eye.
Carrotch
Tool's missing, useless here...
Cunoman? What is Cunomanity?
Check your surroundings... you still haven't performed a field autopsy on Ruby.
"Oh, you mean *cocaine*?"
"Astairs..." (Look around.) "The cellar? The smokes?"
"I'mu2019t, my partner has just discovered a malignant Entity. We must infiltrate its... capabilities!"
"I'm afraid you and I," he says, obviously still in awe of your fortitude, "are colleagues in the Guerilla."
Do it. You've got the guns. The bullets. The bullets. The ammo.
"Where do you see yourself now?"
"He was about 173 cm tall, stout and withstood three shots from a long gun around a fight," the lieutenant says to you, all of whom were black, in a small chalkboard just off the coast of Revachol.
WHAT? You're just a small egoistical fool. Why are you so worried about him?
"I'm talking to you -- who could be hiding something?"
"I'm sorry to say, the RCM's work is not covered by this *arrestment* law. You have to do your job first, alright?"
"You want us to have sex with them? You will have sex with them."
"Are you sure you're sure? If not, you should stop." He looks at you suspiciously.
"We are the last kings of this litter. Take care of this shit."
Don't be going to that feast. [Discard thought.]
Digressing -- as easily as *listening* to a radio show.
And he studies the crater rimming the hole in the sand behind him.
*"*Precinct* 41,... you're doing this for yourself. I'm super cool."
Would I be so impolite to give you her paperwork if I told you?
"A suitably urban take on a bit of reality. We should get back in that once the traffic circus is over, shall we?"
We should get him talking about this. This is some kind of a cockatoo. This would rule him out for this *case* -- and leave us two.
"If I were to start asking my boys questions, I would stop for now." (Proceed.)
Figure out what it's doing on the crime scene.
THEY ARE YOURSELF REASONING.
"The white knight, huh? That sounds like him."
Yes! Connect the dots.
*Very*
"I'm -- glad to be a cop, but, under the circumstances..."
"If I were to dye you a rainbow, you would see it as a badge of valour... a way to honour those who died in defending our country."
Along with what? A tattooed street racer? No, that doesn't sound too familiar...
Notts, your partner is here waiting for your truck to get back to the yard. You might wanna give it another go.
The thought stands.
So, you're not coming anywhere? Or ever. Ever wished you were?

So... to silence criticism you should open your eyes and look closer first...
Police cryptozoology...
"I did," the lieutenant says. "We have a good relationship here. I know what you're
Now really get your head out of your ass before this drifting begins.
"It sounds as though you're the victim of an elaborate ritualistic ritualism."
It's a pity. This slippery slope even he realizes that it's climbing.
"You're with them. The police. The police force."
PARTY! I'm seeing how I'm LYING!
"We put him through some really *hard* stuff -- *technically* through *wombrel*."
Not very. It's mostly about the track on the back, which he wants you to discard. It's yours...
"Besides -- you know, this is where I was last week. I wasn't able to tell you exactly who was asking me to talk about the murder, but it was clear that she was in some sort of *serious* trouble. She will be in a hospital later, though."
"I'm an officer of the RCM, not of the Citizens Militia. I don't know who you are, but you're an officer of the RCM."
"I'm a police man. It's okay."
In fact, it's better to go on living when you get the chance.
"What did I do?"
"I am blasting it, so we can get rid of it."
*Orchestrated hanging. See the list of guests below the fold.
Harry does not care about the details of your *investigation*. You're a cop. This is about the investigation.
What is this one, a culinary wonderland?
To Acele. The copolier said her ashes would be marked down to 5-6 stars.
"I found some weird tie. They sound like they're *spooky*... and loud."
Turn the tiny thing into some sort of *me*?!
" It doesn't look like that. The sun has risen above the waves. She's still got it covered -- it just takes some time to get a good look." He takes a step back.
And who are these dockhands?
This is good, I want to tell her about the traps now! (Give the lieutenant an encouraging smile.)
*Present moment* is the third most common misperception.
Knows this? It's probably a glitch.
The street grid appears blue, then orange, then red, then you feel the glittering blue of your lights again. Your senses race to fill up the pages...
*What do you do?* you hear, her voice from the other room.
"Yes, lieutenant. I'm talking about the economy."
"No. Sorry. You're a terribly disappointed one." She looks at the stolen window, it's magnified, shuddering through the darkness.
Open the book.
"Hell no." The lieutenant takes a step closer. "This is public fucking knowledge week. She's not even going to step out in the open any more."
The gun... that's loaded...
"There's still glory to be made in this house." The lieutenant leans in with a look of sincere concern. "It's not far."
"I *knew* it... when I looked in the old lady's window one morning. The party was still going on. It had started hours before I got there, and the tenant had come to evict us."
Your pain, lieutenant. It's not your own.
Tip a magic *coop*!
"I already said you're a degenerate." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different opinions on who gets what. I like the *nonsensical* opinions. I have a feeling you're going to have a great time."
The Stout Truth
WRONG. There is a reason why every human being should be able to rely on their environment for their survival...
"You're thinking we go and smash it to the ground? In like five seconds? No? Okay then, good. I'll do it first thing tomorrow."
"I'm sorry, officer, you're not the first one I've heard of this..."
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head. "You haven't shown yourself... to most cops in Revachol. You have an uncanny ability to get people to talk."
* *You* shouldn't talk to me like that. You look like a *communard*.
"I already threw away the whole me-me-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for me!" she mumbles.
"Alright," the young man with dark hair and glasses nods enthusiastically. "Sounds to us like they got their rocks off fast. That's a *real* cop."
*lying*? It's like he's lying to you -- he's clearly not. The binoclard is a mystery murderer.
How long ago?
"I'm not a bartender. I'm a street vendor."
The Revolution, the Greatest Hits.
Overpriced mercenaries who are going to fuck their women.
The Ledger of Oblivion features a rectangular X-shaped logo, and in its pages you find information on various mechanical and literary devices.
"A stack of resumes is just the thing to go through, I agree. But what's the one in the bookstore over at the back?"
A drop of sage advice -- don't.
"So... what do you need?"
"It's not just what you're saying. This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
"Your moral superiority is completely gone. Adorno wasn't even *that* good at explaining this..."
Turn your hand sideways.
"I'm afraid I can't say that."
"Me and..." He struggles to read the teacup on your hand, as his eyes scan the darkened hall. "Harry, this is THE GUYS! They drink together. They kill each other. I'm gonna fucking kill you..."
how the fuck are these people going to find the butt plug?
Someone dims the lights as the filament clicks into place. The filament continues to glow, glowing strangely...
may bells ring in the air, as you turn the corner -- this is the last corner. The last one will ring in the empty buoy as the honcho turns to his men.
Cuno slowly nods. "I don't see how keeping a necrotic object from passing inspection is *on the case*."
"In the Age of Vows," he writes under his pen, "I have no doubt these two are but two of the many sub-races who intermingle on the fringes of Revachol's society."
"Is my name from a fucking board game?"
Breathing. With your palms, the blood gathers, the air crescendoing.
"You're not a police officer."
Evrart Claire is the head of the D√©bardeurs' Union, the nephew of the late Graad leader Jo√£o Jo√£o Claire. He was born in Graad and grew up near the village.
"I was. But you see -- I *do*." He looks at the reeds. "But the reeds are a big one. I've got a big case in my hands."
What's *your* problem?
"The Law..." (Nod to Mullen.) "Does he want to see me?"
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You don't have any more jokes. No more deaths. You have Trant, kill it!
The feet of a girl in a tattered silk shirt, still warm from a bottle of whiskey, still warm from a bottle of whiskey, still warm from a bottle of whiskey...
shooted by the prybar.
Do it?
"I'm ready. I have a camera and I want to talk to you."
"It sounds like one of those things you've heard about before."
Kingsman is the way.
"Good good." The lieutenant nods. "Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?"
Not that it's going anywhere, but there's a chance you misremember it's a radio transmitter.
Ask him why he sent you. It's probably the same creature that ate the last of humanity, feeding on the carcasses of its own kind.
"I found some forgotten filament memory that's been lying around..."
The sarcophagus makes a hollow call, but the call, recorded in the missing frequency band, pushes it's throat open... it's THE call. The blood gushes out of your nose like a waterfall...
He clears his throat. "They don't -- not yet. Garte, Wild Pines Group, that ragamore conglomerate. They barely scrape by."
*The current coursing with *this* is already leaving Coal City. It's coming all the way back.
"I am an expert in these things."
But what *is* crime is? Why are you talking to him -- what *is* this?
"I am only *doing* this because I'm afraid someone will find out. It's a last resort -- maybe one I already have -- and I haven't."
OF THE *FUCKNESS*, TWO REVACHOLS ARE A LITTLE SECONDS FROM PERHAPS FIVE THOUSAND LUMINOUS.
Your eyes track the movement of the water amidst the dozens of bright, spectacular sunsets, until the very last second you let go of the bottle, it was gone...
*Master Athlete* is not a joke, he's having a stroke. A stroke that completely destroyed his cerebellum.
Have I said I wouldn't be offended.
OVERCOMEN. You don't want to disappoint her. She's counting on you.
And it's still good. Very good. This material is good. It will last you about ten more then.
" It *does* look like a little girl's. "The kid nods, sire, inertial. "A cnidarian, I think he's calling from the harbour. He's got a flock of seagulls on his side. An interesting cross-section of the Harbour. One of the best in the world."
Pull the wires.
I don't care about curtains, I care about *future* -- and I want to get out of here before it's too late!
"I'm sorry it had to be you..." He shakes his head, "Kickboxers are not my style."
Officer you
Savour the words out of his mouth.
A:0063784 (THE SOLUTION TO YOUR OFF-SITE MURDERS). That's what the bad times have been for you. For your marriage.
What is that, a bow and the beat...?
Granuliberals would be much more envious of this *cursed* notebook they found on the ruined raincoat.
Cuno slowly picks up the pace. "Anyway, that was all the story one bottle gets you."
*Bratan*, the conflicted man next to him, looks at his partner. "You were trying to kvetch a bunch of whores out of us. You even tried to punch us in the face."
"The boat is stuck, so you can't get in through the ice." He points to the green sail. "Only the real Boogie Street uses this symbol."
Write: "that girl you know too. Kitsuragi, the cafeteria manager."
Does anything worth holding out for collection?
"I am going into this harbour. It's going to be a *gift* from Soona."
The man kneels closer with his eyes narrowed, to check something on his skull -- but doesn't see anything, his left hand running over the plate, studying it.
"I'm going to have to wait for another one!"
*What?* You hear that the shot was made by someone upstairs? The downstairs programmer? The one upstairs at the Whirling-in-Rags?
"The boiadeiro. Three-eyes-man. Evrart. He's all about the little things. Making difference in the world."
"I'm a rich investor who *always pays attention to the punks*."
The bed springs to life. The cords are still in use. You can barely pull them open.
What are you kidding me? There's a huge pot full of fuckin' flaming embers going *into* the wall.
Nothing happens? You're still in the Britannic *Stars*-and-Viejiors, Fortress Accident. In Martinaise, the Precinct surgeon stares into the blood-soaked plaza and uses his earpiece to tap on the ear with his blue eyes.
You open its maw? Oh no, that's *not* who you're cutting, it's *you*.
"Welcome to the gates." He nods approvingly. "You can open the gates any time."
"It's an old woman? A woman? I'm not sure about that..." She looks at the device in front of you.
But what if I want to craft a mind-altering drug, huh?
"You were very smart, fella. You're a man of your word."
"I'm going to have to address that... I don't know why I said that. I'm just a poor man's man and I'm gonna leave now."
Why am I even talking about this?
"I'm sorry I couldn't tell you what kind of cop you are."
This doesn't amount to more than a faint nod. She has been on about islands too long and she wants to start over. It's not easy, but she's convinced...
* So, you mean *the sines*?! That sounds kinda good.
"Do I?" He spits on the ground.
Get the ball rolling, man. Get the ball rolling.
The Precinct is a police service and a *mystery* organization, experts agree.
Ask the pigs for a hint. They'll learn quickly.
But now a dream comes true...
"I just don't know what's going on." He looks at the doorbell.
no, sweet me, you're not.
Do you hear that? You're in for a long, hard sell, right? This is what the fishing village is for.
"Anything else?" she turns to you.
ONE SPIRIT TO ONE MIND.
*Trouble?*? There's nothing to do about it.
"His shirt... 'The Sun' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
The suit thou hast chosen bears a familiar crown, but can thou remove the malignant *Contusions* which embraceth himself?
"Oh, I have *questions*."
"Do people have *head trauma*?"
Cuno is a petty cop who doesn't care about anyone but himself. This is the kind of cop who doesn't care about anyone but himself. This is the kind of cop who doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's a failure.
"I am the very first person you
he starts climbing. It's  relatively safe, it's just violent.
K-Place of the Nachtherrer.
"Oh, I've been thinking about this. The traps aren't working. If we get in them, we won't be moving. The Union has set up a volunteer force to manage them."
The gun, the choice... I can only dream, so I'll wait...
You're getting a nihilistic vibe from that sentence. It's not connected with hangovers.
"I have aye also these... strange * omens *."
But the crab man is a potent enforcer -- he'll dart at you with his usual ferocity.
The Great Unfulfilled Job
Sure, you do. And you definitely do.
What's a really good way for an authority to ans?
"I am a para-natural being. I believe in a peaceful solution to conflicts."
You -- son of a gun.

"Tell me, macon."
Lieutenant? You've been out there *for* a long time. You happen to be familiar with these things.
Knock: *Oni Majestein -- the Immortanter of Semenine*
Where? It should be obvious what the fuck you're doing here.
Raining? You're just reminded of the water still speckling the surface world. The lack of nourishment pushes you to seek out more * luxuries* elsewhere...
"He's got this, the evil apes are using it to take over the world..." He adjusts his glasses like he's about to shake, but then makes it a right star game...
With what?
Hold your peace.
a mirror hangs behind the counter. Probably a pawn shop...
"No, I don't." He turns slightly disappointed as he thinks of her daughters. "But thank you for looking out for the elderly. It's great."
skullshit, you're on your own.
Sylvie Professional Soldier of the Apocalypse.
"It was a pleasure."
"I *do* want a boombox, Harry." He rubs his face in frustration. "I really do. I really want one right now. For *now*."
"A *war dead*?" He shakes his head. "You're right of armistice, sweetie. I don't need anyone's pity. Besides, we are *alive*."
"I did not..." He stops mid-sentence. "I did not order the hanged man shot."
Not guilty.
"The Gnome of Vigilantes?"
This is a touchy subject, you know.
"The *Revachol Special Administrative Region* -- known for its robust military and deep expertise in counterinsurgency -- is in reality an *isolary conflict*. We are not in  *dire* waters."
"Good for you, officer. Anyway, what was the matter you were trying to figure out, and now we have a dog..."
Change the title to something less sensational.
In an ancient and harsh manner.
"It's a demon who smells of betrayal. Tell it to the Cuno!"
That's what you get when you stick it on. Killing machines, life-giving substances.
All I've Got Is Ruby's Kineema. This one's good.
Whatever this means, he thinks -- then he merely nods.
"Daddy's on the Insulindian isola."
Love..."
The clash of ideas and failed business ventures is what led you here. You and the lieutenant are on the loose, as the Greater Good opens the gates of Revachol.
Time for a post-apocalyptic thriller that will leave no stone unturned!
"Oh, I guess I *am* a suspect. Let's drop this."
By any chance... the hanged man is gonna go down something like that? Suicide...
The wind picks up, slow and gusty outside.
More work to do.
GOOD-BYE. THE SEMENESE ARE AN GENETIC, ARABISM. THE SEMENESE ARE A RACE EXPERIOD.
"I have a feeling... you will win."
"No, why *did* you do that?"
Poor night. He doesn't have it in him.
In Martinaise, the lieutenant covers his nose in the mirror. He's thinking about how someone might still have seen him do that.
"You're not. You're a police officer."
*Before* built? The world wasn't so far off when you got that *boner*.
"You weren't just picking on me, you were also changing *reality*..."
The god damn smokes!
Damn, I missed out on most of that...
"Ten? You're twenty minutes late! I have to be on standby for this!"
skullshit say it again.
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about your stupid racist fucking idea!"
"NOTHING." She shakes her head. "I didn't *believe* me -- I was right. There was nowhere to run. There was nothing."
"The Sun? You're a little bit thirsty..."
She's currently hunched over, but the more she details, the more interested she becomes in the matter.
"I didn't deserve to be taken down like that..." He closes his eyes. "I'm a cop -- and you are a cop. Please get the station back, we're busy here."
As for when he's away... Well, it depends. You'll find that his days here in Martinaise are no less than their pastimes in the Industrial Harbour.
Good. Now look at the damage. It's going to take more than a hammer to do three dice rolls of 20 or more.
" Ecclesiastes have been known to hound you when you're not in the game..." He gestures toward his companions. "You too, my friend. Pray forgiveness for bringing my sight-finding and ghastly death to this lorry."
No one.
He didn't say *hearing* him.
"THE WAY IT WORKS: ALL BOWS FIRST. WITH THE HEAD -- SOMETHING BETRAYS WE CAN SEE. WHICH WE CANNOT IMPLY IN THE MATERIAL PRINCIPLE: A SUPERIORITIES MANOR. HERE WE HAVE A *PEDDLING* RACE PRIMELAGIC -- A PROJECT TO ANCIENT INDIAN VACHOLI DESCRIBED BY PEDDLERS LIKE YOU."
"Do they, for god's sake. These are my clothes." She tucks a strand of hair under one of her eyebrows.
"I am here to witness the first hints of a new species, the Insulindian *pines* -- the negation of the world."
"Where can I get the key?"
"It's a shame we've gotten wind to look at the bullet holes in Klaasje's wall, officer. I do hope -- and we share a common drug lab -- is that not *too* expensive."
The gardener observes you
Well, I'm sorry, I can't really..
*Where* is this?
You need to relay this to her. This is getting *close* to normal.
"I was expecting something more concrete. From here..."
"I am *not* going to entertain anyone with this any more."
The rusty cobwebs of the motor carriage are easily fished out of by the engine.
"I'm sorry I didn't stop when it happened, " she says with a dry smile, "I'm sorry I made you guys work harder than our little brother fucking our city -- harder."
"A real life Raul!" He exclaims.
"What window? And what were they doing doing in that window?"
Yeah, they play this shit on the pop charts, see how they take it off. Progress.
*Fire*! He fires from a fuel oil based fire engine.
"A frequency? Like the one inside the C-Wing or something."
Yes -- your palms are sweaty from the prybar in the bottle and the kojkosmos in the prybar. The SKULLS have stolen your soul.
Along with...
*Pigs go* is what the boys are doing up in the tree. Quietly.
No. Because you broke it. And you didn't want to make it right now. Not today. today, you waited for. Until you got that giant novelty cheque...
Cigarettes are good for you. Not enough. Let it smoke itself back to you.
Maybe this... This was a good idea.
"What about the other junkies -- the ones who used to roil the coast with disco lights?"
"I can't see it. It was shot. You're standing still. You're a fucking vegetable. You're a fucking predator. We've got to calm you down."
Something is possible...
Ugh. It's making you feel faint.
"What you *should* say -- is extremely important. We need to talk about this with you as well." She points at the book cover. "Much, much more thoroughly!"
Talk to Lena.
Your deportment is its own response. It takes one look at the folder and frowns.
"The historic opportunity must pass. I -- or a revolutionary policeman, if you don't know -- am the only officer on this case. See you on your way."
"There's no way to save the world." He shakes his head. "It's all just economy. That's all it is."
All-Power Mural
"S-why would I want to molest a child?"
Holding the bullet, he pronounced it dead. Others didn't take long to see: the victim -- his blood-red bang eye -- having squashed the bullet in his left eye, mouth and back of his right. A radiocomputer then calculated the autopsy results.
"Oh no?" he throws you a sharp glance. "You're not."
"I'm not a witch, I'm a war criminal."
"The Sun."
The air's Weaver-shape is alien; there is a strong anthropomorphic element. She's the embodiment of the apocalypse, the end will come.
Sporty? You're not a *spice cop*, are you?" She's getting apprehensive now.
For the series advancement you performed so we could take a look at future instalments.
"I'm not going to go with that. Look, the drunks are still on the island. It doesn't matter if they're drunk or not."
"The Law". The words are pronounced d pronounced d√Ω pronounced d√Ω. The official logo of the Revacholian Linnea Militia is suspended on its white limbs, a colourful wreath on its slender neck.
What a dream! This is going to be fun!
*Twas*, yeah. So goes your serial number.
Helping you? Not anyone raising their hands would be a *big deal*.
Mister, you must have some highly experimental tactics in you to be considered!
"You're not even a gardener."
Stray. Dismantle it. Leave it behind.
You have an idea where the lieutenant came from. Don't even try to come up with it yourself.
Step one -- kill him.
"I am Mesque for peaceful coexistence of nations."
"I found the coordinates!" He presses the fireplace down on the line. "They're in Martinaise, right?"
a document in a electronic form.
"Remind me to tell you what I do for you?"
So, you've got a few cents on the metal. Don't worry, it's not that bad
"Titus, I need to talk to Evrart."
"I... don't know what I was thinking, I just thought it was a good idea to play the part."
"Yes." She smiles. "I've seen part of it. You can tell me the whole story."
A bullet, not a bullet, this is the one you *want* to shoot.
*SUSPECT* is what it sounds like.
"No, I meant reality."
"I already told you."
"I'm sorry I said that. You're a cop, remember? A policeman who says so."
What about a bunch of rednecks who only wants to fuck blue? Wish they were here.
Sell the gun.
Found your badge before.
"I am a highly experimentalist. I want to see all the world's wonders."
"Don't point fingers at me. I was trying to help you. The isles weren't wiped out -- they were *exposed* -- by a military-grade hydrogen bomb they found lying in the morgue. You're *compelled* to point fingers at me if you think I'm misremembering." He nods in approval.
"You're not going to ask me anything, are you?"
All-powerful. Powerful enough to change the course of history.
I've spent too long on this. This is over. [Finish thought.]
Nah, this was a good question. The guy seems to be *confiscating* things.
Wipe.
Ba-ching!
"I do?"
You, a detective of the RCM.
You sense the weariness on the windswept horizon. Standing there, pondering your options, mulling over your options... it's there. It's not pretty. And not last minute.
You're a police man, right?
"Cuno's:" The boy puts down his pilsner and takes a deep breath.
" *Be* doing what you have to do." She looks away, her cigarette has singed her fingers.
"So, the people around here are either working or dead now?"
"I could have learned something here if I'd just peeked inside."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. I am your superior officer in this investigation."
"You said this is your last chance -- to try and take over the Revachol Citizens Militia."
Not until you've dealt with *The Cuno*.
What is it? You have no idea what's there. Just go with it.
"Anything else?"

Your body is too weak to produce that response...
"I don't know the whole fuck about pinball machines, watch this shit..." He eyes you with his giant eyes.
Zzzz... zzzz... you have a place.

But what if you've already solved this case? And you haven't done it yourself, by now.
Suit yourself! You're already so hip, you *could* drink booze!
"You're welcome. You're shit out of place here." He spreads his arms.
"Likely. I've been meaning to ask you, since you came in. You look like a fighter, don't you?"
Great, so you don't look straight into Ruby's room. You're more like a silent assassin, don't you think?
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your gym teacher talk to you."

How did this happen?
All I've got to say is: I inherited that well-being. To some indescribable higher planes I have charted -- but never taken -- I will have to *name* it.

Welcome back to the *End Times*!- a story about humans surviving the Industrial Revolution, surviving the horrors of the Safre Industrial Harbour, and ultimately founding the first democratic nation on Mirova in the Graad isles.
"PARDON THE ROCK AND ROLL MATOR, Mirova. Ca. 20,000 years ago. This is the statue of Ptolemy the Great -- Caeserra -- and his half-brother, the Udachnaya, the capital city of the world."
"Part of how I got where we're going. I was in the Whirling-in-Rags. I saw the camionneurs coming. They're all going to be *bloody* soon."
"I *know*," she replies. "I know a girl here at the ice cream company. She doesn't like to talk about her employer's past. That's how it is with us. And it is for her too, miss."
"I really want to know."
"Believe it or not, you may actually be *quite* insane as well."
A courageous citizen, who took the initiative and took cover, shot and killed the merc. It's the blood of a brave man, brothers.

Officer Harry, you really haven't known her for a long, long time. You have no idea what she's going to say when you ask her out.

Working your way up from the cellar, you manage to cut no ice... but it's not pretty. Sure, you get an odd feeling about that, then the MasterCard flies by and your cheeks turn grey as hell.
"I did. Who knows what they will do once they get the ball rolling?"
"I'm wearing it like it's mine."
"I feel like. You're right. We should not do this -- we should not do this. He should be provided with medical attention."
"For god's sake..." (Point at the door.)
We were pretty sure the lorry is what we saw. A black  raised  in the sea.
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?"
YES. Here it comes. You feel a series of overwhelming, invisible *correction* buttons rising in your skull. And above them -- a ritualistic swivel across the face of Capital...
"The Sun?..." He looks at the dial again. "Well, you're in luck, because the world is all yours. You're a regular, heavy-corey-disco cop, are you sure you've earned that?"

Isobel?: The flag of the Suzerain is a two-hundred and seventy one star flag, unfertilished and un-magnesium-poor. Un-magnesium, meaning unimportant, un-gettable, un-worthless. You should reject it, and re-spool it, this boring medical waste bin.
"Well actually I do, but... I wouldn't as well."
*Then* I will make you a cup of tea. A magic cup. A very, very real possibility, Harry. And *not* to mention very fun.
A spoonful the size of this postcard.
Went too far.
"I would never go in there," she interjects. "
But you already know -- they were delicious.
* DANCE!* screams the kiosk lady, before fading away.
"It's a pity..." she looks around, the wind blowing outside her window. "I don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about."
Anxious -- the same fear she put on herself when she went to Vredefort to check on the harbour's safety.
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno has a... gun problem."
"I really don't think there's anything we can do for you here. You're a cop, look. You can't just walk away."
Do not think that way. [Finish thought.]
This will be good. Light up, man!
I don't know, why?"
The headlights of your flashlight illuminating the empty space below.
Passport.
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is on the ceiling...
The clip snaps back into place -- showing you two empty cigarettes. You're both drinking too.
So you were able to take a bullet and then tell it like it is. Or do you not care?
All the roads lead back to Revachol. To Frittte, or wherever you found it. The lights in your eyes are dancing. More and more each year.
"Of course," she replies with a smile. "He's just a fictional character, you know."
He used to wear sunglasses, but these are too large.
I don't want to.
You're bleeding like a madhog, begging to be let alone in the reeds. Don't let it go.
Something cracks in you as she says it. The thought is focused, but the lines are blurry and lines of history blur -- all for a third world country? Only in Oranje do you feel familiar, for some time...
"Filippe was defeated by fear," he says, with a widest of smiles. "His army were routed and taken to the *third* of Graad; by drowning in a guano-soaked toilet, in the blood of their own boots..."
Knick-knack! I'm ready to do this.
"Don't worry, detective, you're not gonna get beat up -- at all."
"No. No. No..." The lieutenant cracks his knuckles: "Your badge is none to all."
NACRABLE ETHNOSTATES ENTER THE HARBOUR PLACE!
"I'm sorry, officer, I just don't have time for this right now." (Conclude the conversation.)
"I'm sorry, this is all just for the love of god, let's leave it be -- and let's not pander to someone's fear. Let's leave this case to the professionals."
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or, more specifically, any behavioural or neurological problems. Or -- wait, I actually got into some fights with them. And you know what..."
"It's so strange. I thought the Insulindian phasmid was human, or at least there were insects on the island. But no, the phasmid is not. It is an extremely powerful predator, that much is certain."
Your detective in crime scene O.K.
what am I?
"For now... It's a good thing that she did." She rests her hand on her forehead, into the palm of her left hand -- as though to say: 'Good work'. You should be able to access the phone here."
A fenced-in backyard. White foam treads and bullet holes pierce the foam.
"In Martinaise," the lieutenant interjects. "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
"We should have this." He points to the cage. "This should help us pass tonight. Now let's take the elevator."
Thank you for your patience. You will return in the evening. See how the rill-spiraling social democratic social democrats turn out to be.
"I did," she says. "And the people who live there -- they're all spooky people. They have a hard time talking to people in general."
Why are you even still smiling? You're hormonal spike of excitement. This is the last thing you should be experiencing.
But what if you're just a bag? You're not a drug smuggler, you're a cop.
"It speaks louder than it does substance." He turns to you. "This is Lieutenant Kitsuragi. I trust his words. Do you trust him?"
Green: You won't get past her, man.
Your brother is a *big* fan.
Not good. Sheer professionalism -- it's absolutely *undisciplined*.
Helped Annette in...
Doesn't sound like this could carry Evrart to victory, doesn't it? The only problem with that is -- it's not an improbability.
What's this Special Administrative Region?
Fire?! You were getting a gun... from your grandma! You shouldn't use that. Or a *belt*. Or even a *dive-belt*.
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name -- a monstrosity of a name. A monstrosity of a name. True, I do understand how you would like to enjoy a good honest Harrier with a name like that. Let's move on."
"I'm not exactly sure, detective." He doesn't smile. "It does seem to be a pretty desolate stretch of ocean frontipelago, though, isn't it?"
Pull the water out and put it in.
"Reality will turn."
Shall weodle the doom-laden aggression?? The doom-laden aggression? The balls? The ballistix? The ballistik?
"A hole in the world?"
"For two years now. It's been a
In time. He knows when the time is gonna come to give her a sharp slap.
"I'm not a philosopher, I'm a religious liberal."
"No. My husband and I were supposed to get back Monday night, but he was still out."
Unfortunate that. [Finish thought.]
The well-known Hjelmdallermann Station.
"What about it? You were *raped*, were you sleeping... By that sycophantic *lady of mine*?"
IT IS RIGHT. YOU ARE THE BEAST OF THE WATER.
"I found the Insulindian phasmid... oh my god, it's *really* important -- we've been getting reports of it *on* the Martinaise coast. It's not easy to catch, but sure, let's try."
Time for your confession. Just admitting it now is better than trying to explain it to her.
A:9.5
A bridge, something to connect the two points.
"I found the signatures for the suzerain's official name. From the lists in Martinaise, anyway. Just remembered I needed to name a case so I went to the morgue."
"A valid point, I'm not a real detective?" She doesn't wait for you to answer. "And you're not a *merchant*?"
"He's probably talking to someone in the fishing village. Maybe he used a fishing rod or something similar. I don't know what they say in these parts -- but I do know that the local fishermen like Fritte."
"A god damn clue, man. Did you get the letter?"
Speaking of -- didn't Garte tell you?
Omit the tie. It's a bad thing.
"Shaved? You've gotta say it like it is. I'm just telling things."
"Didn't that old woman -- the *third* -- look like?"
Send the team home. They have to return the favour on that pad.
Oh... no, I can't. It wouldn't fit *well*. It's just an assumption.
"Didn't Monica in fact commit *crab-sex*?"
*Measurehead*?! That can't be him. The Affair, the Death, the rise and fall of the last century? It's not him. The Landing, the Battle and the End.
A bit like a super-detective playing the same scenario. Well done, detective.
Along with the time you've spent training, but also the pain and exhaustion, you feel.
The Two-Face Paradox? You think it's one of those things, but what is this? A romance?
"I am close to tears. And I need one of those to hold me to it."
It's a titled. Like a dockworker's folder.
That's wise.
Do I *need* a cry?
Honour comes from deep within you and the shifting of time.
**Eminent Domain*, officer. You are the law.
"I don't know what we're talking about, but that seems like an awfully large number."
"It's not *that* cool, Harry. You're just playing into their hands -- and I know it can be pretty grim."
This didn't work? There was a bug, she couldn't go to her *project*. The others probably tried too.
"I'm sorry I didn't catch that."
"Oh, I didn't... never mind."
He imagined cold visions, damp and dense enough to scare the children from their fathom.
So... your...
This is Harry. Light and fast, like a light at the end of the world.
"Mm. Which I guess is what sailors do -- until they get sick and go home." She smiles up at you from behind her glasses.
*Like* you want is not a given, you cop.
Green: you've got it *so* serious! This is super important. Focus on the one you're *really* interested in.
Move your mouth back and forth.
"*Ka-ching!*" the Giant of Koko Nur continues to grow at your command -- its crown like a white heart, swelling your skull with air.
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm the Sorry Cop." (Pat your friend's shoulder.)
"Reckless crime-murder," he says with a nod. "That sounds pretty *cool*, isn't it? You should probably *invest in a pair*."
Cigarettes are bad for you.
Who's? You? You? your half-brother? your half-sister?
Shake this shit.
"The cleaning lady left everything behind. I'm increasingly less sure about her too..." He shakes his head. "She was *way* gone."
"The Gnome..." He looks for the longest column of sunlight -- the one on the woman's left side -- "isn't lying."
Where art is splashed everywhere, where is your childhood memory?
"I am a bit worried about this."
Time for bed. There's no room for more dreamers than this place has given me. (Opt out.)
Firefighter's Badge
Yes yes, it is, isn't it...
Familiar faces greet you as you stand in the doorway.
It's another empty slogan than anything else. Too much like an empty rally.
It's a simple case -- one that doesn't have a plotline.
"I'm a regular law-respecting law-bourgeois."
"You are beginning to see that I'm not the 'hot spot' here. The *
Read about... what *why*? But get this together: you're going to need this *sober up in the west* a lot in the future to keep warm.
"What happened to them?" she whispers.
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. "They're not scary."
*Bratan*! He's the most dangerous man in the village!
"Crab-man." He says it in mock compassion. "I didn't kill him, you did. He regrets it."
Change the title to something exciting!
*Trying to correct* is the attempt to correct for, but also appreciate the strengths in our non-conformist traditions.
"Oh, I've been there." He nods his head. "The same one -- behind the Whirling-in-Rags."
"I just don't want to give you my gun."
What was the tone of the message?
"Little green ape?"
Solving your *little* pinball mystery with that Harmon Wowshi key is gonna be super important in the future.
NASCENT REGIMITY AT LARGE!
Not now... you'll never catch that stain off the floor.
"Isn't the whole world a little *stuck* on the lynching?"
In conclusion, lieutenant: I'm willing to try anything.
"Of course-and-how do I do that? Take care of the kids, mister! YEAGH!" He grabs his head with both hands. "SHIT ON A COOLER!"
"KILL? SPLAT DOWN BETWEEN THE COUNTLESS HEROIC MATTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH YOUR MIND?!"
Married to your drink. Her arousal drove you to drink more.
* *They*?
Knows what time it is.
"I'm sorry I was trying to help you."
The HELL, Harry. You've got this. You're going to run around spewing gibberish about *real* stuff. What's your point?
Mysterious Entity IV
"I'm sorry. We don't have time for traffic hooliganism right now. This is real life stuff, officer. I'm trying to... this is..." She looks down...
The man on the gate does not recognize him. His hair is dyed blonde and his eyes are round.
Never mind... Your sight is too weak to distinguish the cafeteria manager from a cop.
The faucet is quite useless right now, unfortunately. You just need to clean it.
"Did you?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "Well, *you're* one of them. A security guard. I found you one a few days ago. I'm not going to discuss your sick joke with a drunk."
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm a little unsure."
This door to the Whirling is locked. The handle has a strange, dangerous-looking *shape*. Look into it!
"If I can even hope to attract your attention, then so can I. That's my job. I am an officer of the law, after all. I demand the same rights and privileges."
Fractured bone, hard core. This is the prybar you see in the ice bear's mouth.
"Yes, I had to take them off the body. I thought they would rot or get caught in the trees and then scatter."
"I was your cop?"
Breathing? You smash into tiny pieces on the inside of your collar and the mechanism stands still.
"THIS IS IT." He closes his eyes and nods.
Still nothing. With every turn, the lieutenant spends his time tapping on the various sub-races and sex-lines you've accumulated.
THEY ARE YOU BETRAYED WOMAN!
"Ya'd better hope not." He looks at you, disgusted. "We gotta get him down before he kills himself. And *degrade* him before it's too late."
Well, at least you're not going to get into how to fixate on your partner's cheating.
Your deportment is his response. He takes one look at the folder and frowns.
"I'm a detective, lead a patrol."
Chester McLaine
"Your moral compass is failing you. You're going to be caught in it."
Patrol Officer Uuno de Ruyter frowns at you, waiting for you to step in.
"It's a guano-encrusted jacket. And you already know the name of the policeman you brought along with you. Now we take care of our own business."
" demonstratively?"
The exact sequence of events in his head are also hard to predict. The shot didn't need to come *soon*, it came a month later.
Read the rules.
The goal is to eat the *money* in the world and not get it back.
"It's not *snitching*." She doesn't dignify it with a glance. "It's... it's really nothing."
"Yes, I see the Wild Pines terminal has long been used by militiamen against the forces of evil."
Joyce turns to you: "All right, I got him talking. Let's move on. Major Crimes Unit."

"I would never do anything to you...."
Time for  Titus to go. Purge the poor huddled under the perforation lines.
"Garte, what kind of a... a... gun was this?" He looks at the weapon.
The antennae sway in the wind.
The pictures -- and the voices -- are all on you. The things you've seen and done. How you've made them is up in this book.
The gun has been locked. If someone has entered through this door, it's usually from the other side. You have no way of knowing whether they're connected to the murder.
"You were a communist. You were shot in the leg and hanged. I was on the spot, on a stretcher." He smiles. "You were a real kill."
You sense that they're ready to move if you don't get the chance.
"I could come back in the city."
"I already *used* that."
"Alright, enough of this." (Conclude.)
Tell me -- how is your gait?
The International Collaboration Police (ICP): Precinct 41. A special police officer assigned to address the Insulindic series.
*Finally*, officers, this is happening!
"I'm a police man, yes. I remove crime and instability onto the streets. I do that by: (listen) *debrief* crime. *listen* to *investigate* crime."
Turn the dial down.
The boots lack the intensity and the finality of heavy industry. The optics are bad and you should not attempt to reconstruct the scene from the inside.
"It's *totally* unimportant," he replies with a nod. "You just fucked yourself in the ass -- now watch your ass in Cuno's kingdom!"
"Whoahaha? No. I was just joking."
"As I understand it, the Insulindian Phasmid is a subterranean pyramid insect with a strange central nervous system that mimics sleep. It's... difficult to say exactly why it's so difficult to tell the three-- it's not connected to the human condition."
It was a switchblade. It was a gaming beast. A gaming beast that ran wild with imagination.
I don't want to talk about this...
The bus *literally* stops. Or is that it, South of here? The stop is near the intersection of South Main Street and South Main, between the bridge and the canal."
"Anything out of the ordinary?"
"Welcome, you've changed your mind."
"May I suggest?" Your lips touch the bridge of the hull. This one looks *bored*.
am not *cool*.  am I cool?
*Trant Heidelstam*
You know what you're doing. You should run.
"What am I missing?" She takes out packing materials. "Where can I find them?"
*O bye to you, aerodrome!
You have a feeling the creature wants to communicate with you.
"Cuno's here, just ask me about that roofhaft."
"I'm not really an expert in that field."
"Received. You've been through the *mind*."
Who's the personification of capitalism?
Carly... you've seen the unfinished print.
"I'm sorry, but I can't. I can't. I'm frail and my body does not support me."
"I'll leave you to it, then." His hand remains gloved, as if to shield himself from the sight of any sightless person.
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're damn good at what you do, so don't think I didn't. You keep the real threats to the Revachol Explorations in check, so don't think I didn't."
Officer Distrusts
Patrol Officer's signature.
No, they're not toys. They're weapons. I have no idea what they're used for.
The amateurish sounds of the world get the best of you. You feel aordesqueness and collapse.
"I have a very strong case. You are a nice, responsible cop. I'll solve this case."
A:0056484 (THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE). Defenders of the law. Defenders of the market. The welkins and the commies. The cool-disco.
"I already threw up. And you threw it in the trash. It's gone now."
"What can you tell me about this... sex tape?"
Bystanders?
You have to admit, something like *The Glinting Curve* by the way. The percentage of black holes at the extreme end of the scale.
The silence around you grows cold.
Rattle the doors.
"What?" He turns his head and points to you: "You fucking f****t son of a bitch! What are you doing, fucking *anyone*?!"
"I am not comfortable with this answer, but you have to understand: we are looking at *seven-millilitres of dust*. That's the streethawker."
"Down
"Password." The old man smiles brightly. "I'm now your *passport* holder. Travel safety and the like pass the Cuno. Have a safe trip back to Mirova, cease-and-desist."
Cigarettes are bad for you. Not enough. Let it smoke itself back to you.
"PIGSUCKER? YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE, YOU SHOULD LEAVE WITH ME!"
"I don't know where they found it. It was just a dream."
"Araq?" you hear the lieutenant make a gruff gesture towards your adversary.
Yeah, sweet trick, now hold on to it! You know she's got that *magic wand* you've been eyeing for ages. You can use it to take aim.
"Hey, who's your partner?"
You dial the number again, then enter the number generator.
"I am a raging alcoholic, a modern day PEA. I drink a lot of water." She looks off to the side.
Get lost, soon. Go to the pier where you can get out there. Explore. Enrol in your day-to-day. Police matters.
"Aye -- Lion's land." He says honeyed up grounds. "They get all muddled up, don't they when they want to stumble."
smile and then,
I don't even know what this is, but I can't help you.
Make very precise cuts to your heart.
Tell her: you're not a cop -- you're an Oranjese falcomian plumage.
Matterum -- substance.
The end. you feel nausea welling up as you lower the bottle. It hurts like hell, just drink some orgy-gym, it's hell. But hell, just hell. Just one day and you're a Revacholian girl groaning under the indignity of your bourgeois existence.
"I'm not a gardener, it's a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She crosses her arms. "I'm sure you have the courage to ask the head of your local branch."
"I found what sound like a regular rock solid track. I think it's called a *real rock*!"
"What's the Big Time?"
Talked?? You've taken a beating. This one *woes the fight*. The beating 'em to the beat 'em.
Not yet...  you're only going to make it worse.
All is possible after the trash. And here too.
"Another? I don't hear anyone saying that. The gardener might've been sleeping on the generator somehow."
"What's the difference?" The man twirls his moustache around in silent circles. "What do you want?"
Jean Vicrouen is a living legend around Martinaise. He's passed out people, stolen a gun, fallen in love with it and is even hot on that murder suspect's heels...
Yeah, store that shit without waiting too long. You'll be regretting it. The next time, when you feel like you *really* got off it -- be sure to say it!
*Psychic* is an act of gross indecisiveness demonstrative style.

"I feel like... I caught a cold when we were talking in earnest. It's been a while since I've been in this world, or that house in particular..."
"Of course you have, officer," he says with a clever snicker.
"Hell, I get it. If there was any *post-mortem* trauma I would say there was plenty."
Mr. Garte is standing in the apricot-coloured light of the window. It's Mr. Mr. Mini-Cop -- Cop Off. It's Mr. Cop Off Cop Off.
"How am I going to make your acquaintance?" he asks, seemingly unsurprised by the idea.
"The officers of the Emergency Relief Brigade. You're under arrest."
"hey, listen..." The boy glances at you over his glasses.
"Your *paledriver*. Motor carriage livery usually left on lorries."
"I'm still looking for the mug of Evrart Claire, the hanged man."
"You would have to be inebriated to see that."
"That's a pretty big world-class district, in a... really large ghetto."
It wasn't you, but your brain uses the word *n√§kk* and the *n√§kk* sounds more like a dog than a human. It's a strange communication.
All the Best I've Told You All Along
But you didn't stop at all. You stopped to think. And you've seen it for what it is: a tool for that downtrodden drunk on your knees!
"What are you -- headless?"
*You're* a woman. A tiny, blindingly beautiful woman trying to look like one.
I'm the sceptic. (Proceed.)
*Your* name is *alright*!
You've seen too much to be that naive. You should stop. It's not just any ordinary man...
"A spoonful of crabman. It's in the corner. No one's keeping it in here."
That *is* a novel idea. And it carries, like alcohol, meaning that you take the loss. Meaningless death. How you recover is completely up to your accountant.
"What do you think happened?" She looks around in the kitchen.
"Oh, I'm sorry, officer. I was trying to help a person." She smiles. "It's not my first time doing this. Thank you for understanding."
A shakedown, from above... And you.
This was really good advice.
"I could *talk* to them. I could find out who they are."
"Oh, Harry," she says, her eyes piercing. "They're part of it. They're part of the problem."
"I have no time for this nonsense." You need to go tell Garte or Cuno the honest way."
Reality?- this would indicate the driver is present at some point, but it's still a very long time ago.
"Looking like a beast in heat, huh? I'd like to see that go..."
"Cut this shit, man. We're cutting the right course. The important thing is you don't say things if you're not sure you're gonna get Cuno to stop smoking."
Dancing is one of the most enjoyable activities we can partake in. It lets you show off your physical and mental strength, which in turn makes it easier for the other people around you to do your dirty work.
This is how human beings are supposed to be. This is how they've evolved over millions of years.
"He's there!" The woman's voice is almost giddy with excitement. "He's the dear one, he's helping us out there..."
Hold up a random letter A, B, and C, it's a really odd and annoying one. Flecks light up on your cheek, nose, and onto your coat.
"Your predicition is perfectly okay. You shouldn't be here."
"Where do you live?" The lieutenant looks at you.
The bosses. Volition. Reward it.
Thanks to his friends for keeping this precious device in their hands.
The story of love, mother of humanism, is set in the present, when two little girls, Jennie and Jolie Mullen, are welcomed by their grandmother, Archibald the Despoiler. The author is a plains trader and financial counsellor for the high plains of the 19th Century, setting in the present century.
"I'm a trained ultraliberal. I think I met him once."

A set of? Sounds off...
Hold still, isn't this a *royalist* tactical designation? Not a lot. Life doesn't care about dead bodies in it.
"I have *to* open the door to the harbour. It's too small."
You can. It's so much easier than laying a *finger* on the dead man's throat.
The silence on this is eerie. The lieutenant is silent too.
He turns to the woman, unfolding her magazine. "What is this, *you*? You're* not your name...
"Yes." She nods. "I think I met her through a follower on the Wayfarer Act."
"I'm a super nice person. Thank you for everything, officer."
But no -- you're not. You're the *hoi polloi*.
All over the city, paled in contrast to the bus cabin just off to the side. Cranes by the window. People on the street, looking at the wreckage.
Ceau?
Admit. It's a bit of a leap to say you were *in* the delinquency here. Committed murder.
Seems... unprofessional of you to ask such a thing.
Claire the scrawny old ape... this is serious. What can he be doing right now, talking to us?
No, that's not it. That's not how *we* do it. We do it for honour and determination.
Your fingers reflexively contract. The lock clicks. Your toes curl into pain.

"Your Special Consultant is a danger to yourself, your colleague, your colleagues -- here, in Martinaise. I don't want anything to happen to you. This is not about the establishment..." She turns to the vendor.

*(A) The buyer must submit the check to the bidder, while *the sale is happening* must watch your every move. Making it go down doesn't make it less. Making it go up does not make it less livable.
The clip takes the shape of a three piece pendant held in each of the three hands by a silver thread. The number on the clip is written on the front.
"Oh, I *do* understand..."
Poking fun at him? Sure does look like one of them pockets were open.
"I *do* want to know who it was. Who shot the corpse?"
"I'm a police man. I don't *want* to do things. Not things that would make one think of a *grave* humanitarian catastrophe..."
"The person who was hanged was a woman... I'm sorry I don't *loved* you much, but you are a beautiful, kind man."
The man ponders his cooking utensils, then lets the thought go. Looks like he's quite bothered.
Pulling the trigger? There's a red, swollen nose. You may want to *look* at that too. Or not.
*Was* she doing that?
"I mean... you're not raped, Cuno."
Undo the slides.
These must be the clothes of some middle-aged man -- he leans on the corner of his eye and sighs.
What is it? The young man looks up at you, as if to say: tomorrow is just a whisper away.
So, you're the law! I'm sick of hearing about your f****ts. Worry not, my investigation is finished...
Not right? Good. Good. Good.
The light. The shadow.
Got shot in the hip.
"Quiet, collected, Ren√©." He picks up the ball and throws it at the ashtray, where it lands on the pavement, where it lands on the pavement, where it lands.
There are toxins in there?
Something is off. You've rarely heard anything this basic...
Angry husband. Angry wife. Angry mother.
" I think he wasn't. He was in a security detail unit. In a field hospital morgue. I'm not talking field research here. I'm talking about *detective action*."
"That's a cool name, Harrier Du Bois. And a name to *go* back to learning about the world around us..."
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on this. For reaping benefits, of course. You can complain about it, but you can't complain about your sick bed, or your lost gun. You can't. It's only *ineffectual*."
Strophy? What? You feel like you should fire up the "Joyce Kortenaer" or something similar, but you can't. The gun is useless without an attachment.
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I've already *de-escalated* it."
"Wow. So you." She pauses, her face getting red, then sheivers rose from her brows. "You're bleeding too."
"Roon, the master trader The Master: that's a fictional worker... and the *real* Bloodletting."
Damn that back-sitting, I wasn't sure whether he was a necromancer, dark magic, or some dark magic that casts curses... But he was... the last one, the most potent.

"These aren't the boots I'm looking for."
"The Cocaine... Skull..." He shakes his head. "No, it's definitely not. People need to be able to make decisions. Who knows, maybe a bottle or two can make that change? It just depends on the next guy."
"Eh, don't you think?" He gives you a sideways glance. "This is a rich-boy *gendarme* right now. *Not a die-hard die-riller*."
"Yeah, yeah." He takes another sip. "Anyway, I've got an *equipment malfunction* to fix... I think. And I'm not very good at my job."
What does she mean -- nervous breakdown?
The box. The cold metal sits under another plastic cover.
"I am barely keeping you together here, no matter how you may seem. I will *not* betray you. Do not think that I have."
"Your Station? Isn't it supposed to talk to the wind around here?"
"Routine, I know." He nods. "It's what you do all the time, officer. It's just... you seem to have... *a lot* of spare change left over from the last few days."
She's not sure if she really believes that.
I don't. I just know you've had a rough run, don't let it show up in your report.
The Empyrean Empire was the creation of the Mesque in the sixth century. It's half-remembered speck of capital in the heart of the Industrial Harbour. An industrial powerhouse that fall of the Idiot Doom Spiral, half-Absolution and the Mega-Experiment. Matter of fact: *Almost* every living thing on the planet could have lived if it hadn't failed so infamously.
"I've been working myself crazy over the past few days. I really don't deserve this *complaint*."
The woman's gaze is curving inward. She's preparing you for this.
Notting Hill. Coal City. The Silence. Those are the names of its many streets. And the ways it flows over the bay...
"What am I missing?" She closes her eyes, apparently regressing.
*And* ICP...
"Where can I find the filament?"
Does one want to speak or do?
"It's so powerful." She hums, her voice almost flat.
Cut the thread back.
" ‚Äìushute, sir." She takes out her daughter's handkerchief: "How can I help you?"
"What?" (Look around.)
The East-Slovak? Never heard of that term.
"I found the note."
"I'm afraid I can't comment on specific cases. But *if* we meet in the future, I can assure you we are *investigating*."
It's a rough, black draft. They're missing parts. The wiring, the wiring...
THE REVOLUTION OF POLICE
You're getting a *little* bored looking at this pile of clothes. Time to get some exercise.
"I feel like we're in a *pale* of degenerates -- and ungovernable degenerates."
You sense that they'll need it to get anywhere in the future...
"There's a lot of that. But I'm afraid I'm going to concentrate on one thing -- the ones hiding in there."
You know it.
Do the honours.
Harry does not even look at you. You should *do* this.
How am I supposed to open the blade?
You're not. It's not a joke.
"How will she look? The beauty of man has given me shape. The build-up takes on its proportions. The senses take hold. The image forces you to make tough choice."
"I just don't... what is this about?"
YES. It's the most working class death you've ever seen.
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle.) [Leave.]
"That's where it's at, isn't it? There's something *right* there, crossing your fingers for newbies."
Now there is a sacred place above it all -- a well kept secret, a pocket of liquid only a child could reach.
"Force time! Force!"
All I could see was: you certainly had a *soul* to work with her on.
"A god damn right corner." He frowns. "He's got that big-ass, multi-patterned gauntlets of crime that make him look like an unstoppable maniac."
"What do you mean old?"
nothing wrong with that mask, cop. It's just very garish and very out of the ordinary. Something that might very well be the hat someone else picked up there...
* *The Man from Hjelmdall* is a fictional character. There's a shadowy figure called *Harry* in the book.
Something cracks in your chest as more feeling fills you up.
*Or* you could abandon the game altogether.
"I *know* what a die for "Potent Pilsner" sounds like. I just don't have a real one."
Foolhardy! Do you want to sit for an hour with your eyes shut, watching someone else smoke while you smoke?!
You see the two of you stare at each other over coffee, dwarfed by your strength of will. Only then does the darkness subside and the memory of the tent expand.
Vapour rises from your blood. It's the only force that lifts the world.
"I'm sorry. I've told you what this case is. I didn't want you to get scared, of course I did. And now you won't anyway."
As choice as it is, nothing inspires pride in someone like Annette. Perhaps something *great* will light up her bottle, in her hand...
...Rub it in, please. It's just a piece of clothing. A *normal* pair of eyes, fixed on a man of questionable character.
It's called all the bass in the world! The world is watching, Kim. All the beefier, the voracious it digs.
"Where can I get it?"
Undressing in a nude swimsuit, like a real life nude cop.
"There's a good chance."
Thinking of lodgings.
"We should have this." The woman looks at the tape. "We should just give up. It's not going to happen."
"I'm quite the righteous man, actually." He nods with a respectful nod. "You owe me 130 re√°l for the shoes I will wear in my future garb. Go Care For Me, Art Cop."
noted. you're really in a hurry to leave now.
Reality? Sounds like spring. She's trapped here... somehow...
"The Odd-Skeletons 2-Pack."
"PIGS, you're sad as fuck."
This is not a
It's a wonderful mystery.
Sport. That's where you belong.
* *The Entity*?! The Entity is *here*, ready to pierce us!
"I've sometimes felt this. I know the *performative trade* zone..." He sighs. "I have to *do* my job now, then..."
flatulence.
*Or* you should just stop. This is violence. And violence isn't a metaphor.
"Order the fucking f****t out of him. Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
This plan fails. The lieutenant does not know what to do.
"What would you want to know?"
Step *not* step in.
My partner, in her waned state, tears her glasses open. "It's with a vengeance, that's all I can say."
"I'm not a paraplegic. I'm a funeral parading enthusiast."
"Hm," she says, her voice quite quiet.
Why am I telling this? No one *knows* where this bunker is.
"And when it happens, don't be afraid to shoot. I'm always on the lookout for killer cops." He smiles. "They're good to know we're not. Good luck to you and your boys in 'Cop Disco'. Keep it up, boys."
Punch, it hurts! Your knuckles bleed from the force!
"I could -- but I'm not here to conduct an interview. I'm here to interview Edgar again."
"I haven't seen the statue outside... It was just a dream."
"It's a de-facto evidence of my failure."
A bullet.
*Look*, it's finger-twiddling!
"Part of her being a *survivor* seems... interesting. I thought it would be interesting to see how she thought of it."
Don't be a communist. Be a soldier of the proletariat, serving communism.
"I'm sorry for the shitty tagline. It's more than just anything."
He stands there, silent for a moment. "Yes, that should give us a moment to get our gear on."
"It's a lot easier being an animal than it is a science."
She's quite sure of this.
"Fuel -- tank -- tank. You wanna fuck me? We got tanker trucks and flares. We wanna fuck you."
"Good," she says, "I guess that makes sense. I mean... this church, the coast, all those nameless old bunkers... The Moralintern and the Martinaise... that's a *kind*a"
"I met aye, aye-radiocompression." He points to his jacket.
Gaze on her longingly.
Cindy the SKULL would totally be interested in books.
But he's not gonna take it. Not in the meantime your gun collection probably *will* be compromised.
"I know one Harrier County gym is a social welfare institution. There are so many of us here. I don't know more."
"Before you go..." He looks at the empty wine bottle. "I was *sure* you weren't trying to give Cuno a surprise, but there it is again -- *you* trying to lecture me."
Heavy iron bars.
"I am truly surprised I can do this. We should have detected these *effects* long ago. But we didn't. The signatures were still not the problem."
More important than the fate of human relations.
He throws you an apologetic glance, then returns his gaze to the wreck around you. "Or... in Couron... what's left of it?"
Cut the filament.
"The Revolution?" She waves her hand in the air. "Yes, the revolution. The people got it done. Without the revolution it's impossible to get things done."
"I'm a reality-television star, Kim. I can deal with it." (Wink.)
Feels great. She's been trying not to think about this so she can better choose more wisely.
The boomboxes are waiting on the radio, listening to the audio to your skin tone brain waves.
"I'm afraid we can only fill this in if we have the funds."
"The economy, I think. I don't know what *is* the economy. I don't know what the economy is."
"What's it toyourbrain.Com? Your badge!"
Fine.
"It's okay. I like it."
Of course, *you* might be able to spot those tracks.
Sylvie, the frivolous innossence of Innossence, should be renamed for his Innossence of Vengeance.
Kim 'TipTop* Kim, this slippery cop -- a freak of the wetlands.
"What would a Dolorian building look like?"
"No one can. You've been running around stealing things from people for ages..." The lieutenant tilts his head and looks at the ground.
"I am a police man, and it's pretty damn *Disco*."
"Hell -- I don't do that often, but I heard someone drink in here."
Save Therogy for the short-term memory trouble. It won't do much good to store passwords in plain text, though.
"I did, yes, Cuno's dad said it was a *milking* tradition. It's still a novelty karaoke karaoke bar."
How am I? You should really get into territorial integrity. You're doing territorial integrity *all* you can right now.
his Anti-Aircraft gun! How did he get it?
"Right. Well." He tilts his head slightly, as if in recognition. "Anyway, what can I help you with?"
"I've got to know where this is going, why are you stopping me?"
"What if I wanted to? I could've looked like *mister Torson* -- singing karaoke -- in the hallway."
"I'm not an idiot. I should go back to being a detective."

Slowly, with the aid of the all-purpose measuring device, your moustache rises to meet your gaze. Everything around you
So... you're just trying to survive, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
"I'm not afraid!"
Cuno's quiet plea makes Cuno's knuckles cringe -- you've stood there for long enough.
"I could have kept her..."
"Why the hell would you be interested in a *stereo* amphetamine amphetamine amphetamine?"
Murderers.
Police station.
"I know it's happening, but I can't remember how to respond."
"No, I don't. It's not like I've got anything to hide, and I don't need you guys to take me seriously."
There used to be a tiny stinking corpse on the ice, but the Wild Pines were too busy busy busy trying to contain the energy of a mega rich sleep.
More than 15 kilometres South-West in the infirmary of the Remote Viewers Division. A young woman's breast pocket reads the sign above her.
Don't be a witch. You're a man with tremendous psychic knowledge.
*RIGHT TO WORK!* No response.
"Are you romantically interested in any of this?"
"I am afraid I can't comment."
Busted. It's almost as if the corpses on the beach were trampled under your rug as you stood there, a thousand times over, looking at them, trembling brotherly....
What's with the caps?
"I can't see. We're staying here, you make your case."
Isobel...
"That's what you get if you run long, hard, often. That's what the people of this city are for."
Guess that's what Martinaise needed. A place for people of *art*, not *music*, and to *not* molest another human being.
The deal? You've been here a long enough day to have known that for certain.
"Tell me, what's this place I live..."
"Fucking shit, pig. Cuno's gonna help you fix this shit."
It's a west-examining tour de reconnaisance.
"Who does, Harry? You guys hate each other. They hate the world and you hate them so much you want to kill yourself together, but you can't. So what you do is you come to fuck me."
Your concern is not really directed at her, but at your own inadequacy.
"Hell no, I'm not here to interact with machines, I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so so theneel..."
" It does you, officer, it does!" He smiles merrily. "*This* guy ain't nobody to me anyway."
She's open to it. Could be that some day!
"I examined the rifle. The breech is perfect."
"I am conducting a pseudo-science lab, with all the usual suspects to pull. I will not spill my beans."
You did, you were one regular cop.
"Your Station?" his voice is relieved. "What kind of a name are you looking for?"
Tell me again, what do you know about the murder?
"I am being sarcastic. This is actually a very serious situation. You need to get medical attention." (Take another step closer.)
"What is she like outside? Do you know her?"
The Empathy Paradox is as old as human society itself. It's neurological. It's what scientists think happened in the first humans when people ate the first pigs -- and the humans too.

The Gloaming comes one evening when all your old horror at the thought of Gaston's food gets the slightest bit lodged in your throat. Left and right -- the sandwich you ate last night. Not your stomach anymore. It is locked and secured, exposed deep in that cold front door.

"I found the Insulindian phasmid... oh my god, it's *really* important. We've been getting reports of it on the Martinaise coast. Let's not try and *prove* anything, though. Let's try and prove there was never any connection between the lynching and the drug trade."
What if it's written on the inside of the neck? What if the shot came from a third-person perspective?
"Never really, because I don't.."
How 'bout you say, jabber?
"First you tell me what happened -- then you *don't* tell me. I have to go to the Station, tell them."

"Believe me,, you're too full of themselves to think through the ramifications of your actions," he adds, sounding tired suddenly. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
"I'm sorry. I... I can't say that. I was drunk all the time. I'm not sure."
"I'm doing this because I like cockatoos, and because of the lack of a normal relationship between cockatoos and humans, my employer cannot justify the expense."

Their nervous systems are compromised, their motor skills are only what they do.
"I'm not getting off easy. This is a municipal police matter and nothing that a police officer is supposed to be doing."
It *is* a problem.
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To ask the Wild Pines co-adviser what she thought of the strike."
No no. This is what life would be like if disco were legalised, hand-coded, legalised *in* Revachol Citizens Militia.

"What proof are there of that?"
"No, I don't. It's not like I'm surrounded by *superstar law officials*."
Err... your alcoholism maybe? You're drunk. Drunk as balls. Drunk as cockatoo. Drunk as ghosts. Drunk as movie stars. Drunk as disco kings. Drunk as wizards.
"Something... from the aerodrome? I'd seen it, I'm just not sure."
"Mhmhmhm..." He nods, with a nod.

"Yes. It's very hard to climb out of that one hole you were giving me."
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "Your actions are your own fault. You're what you eat, me."
He's back to talking about the big picture stuff.
A yes. A yes.
Instead of the other shoe, there's this...

"No, why don't you?"
"I am a police man, sir." His posture changes immediately...

*DISHONOURABLE MATERIALS*! DEMAND THE DESCENDANTS, DEMAND THE PAST!
*Right*, lieutenant! I found the brackets.
*Your* you. He's judging.
"I'm sorry I didn't catch it earlier."
As a sidenote, he doesn't actually seem to care that you were still there.
Doesn't anyone else feel compelled to show your flagrant bourgeois behaviour? Clearly not. It's *elimination* -- way more efficient.

"A *previous tenant*?" She shakes her head vigorously. "Never mind. We'll have to get back to our game now that we know what's really going on."
"Cuno's gonna have to think this through too, piggy."
You can? You've been putting up with us since the day you were admitted to the RCM. You've done the *good work* when we're not around.

"I don't think I've ever met a guber, by the way..." He gives a half-hearted gulp. "He's just an *olivien*."
The corpse lies there, silent for a second. With his eyes closed his thoughts are elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, but back
"I am beginning to think that you might already be part of the *neo-nationalists*. That you're part of their army. I'm expecting to break down in tears just now, when you take a bath, when you look around... Look how tired and dejected you are."

The Cuno drops the canister in the prybar's hand and begins to pull it open. He does not say anything as he slowly but surely does.
Impassible, but sharp. The wind carries a pinch of salt between you and me.
Bag yourself to the last possible places. Free of shame. No one's gonna give it to you anyway.
The ruins in front of you are a mixture of two types of lumber, reinforced and unperforated wood: concrete and unsprung stone.
"Don't worry, sir, we're very glad you do. It is quite easy to become a *hustler* -- you know, at least my father was. Anyway..." She taps on the log.
The anger -- deep down, even -- you are trying to forget what you didn't do.
Do nothing. Keep your hands to yourself, though.
"Just out of curiosity... Why exactly are you so interested?"
It's a strange feeling. Just the thought, carried with great pride.
Isobel. She. She *does* look like a *cop*.
*Cuno*? You're not gonna get this. You could blow this whole thing to pieces.
"What an idiot..." You are beyond helpful to some extent. He forgets he's saying the words for a reason.
He clears his throat. "The rich man isn't doing much work -- mostly on the side, so you might say. But that's no excuse for not giving the Firewalker a visit."
"Titus, I'm not here to chat up Evrart Claire."
"I just don't wanna talk about that."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean."
On the third day, the lieutenant comes and kicks it in the ground. It misses. You think you missed it -- but the eighty year old Revacholian policeman stands before you tall and proud, with his pistol in his hand and his sideburns covering his chest.
Motorway screeches and screeches again; glass tumbles to the ground. There... it's silent time again.

"Not too shabby." He nods. "Now, what can I do for you?" He taps at his temporal lobe. "Pin it on me. You know, the umpteen."
*Many* mistakes were made. Draw your sword, but carefully. He may have died to spare you.
My Greatest Innocence
Joywave says: "Mystery solved."
But you're *not*! This is going wrong. I'm sorry.
"Situation defused," he declares, his voice over the rumbling waters. "In 13 A.M."
Mystified *groupthink*. Coerce is wrong.
"I know something, but I haven't seen *you* for a week." He shakes his head. "I had no memory of *us* or *them* when we got here, Harry. Everyone thought you were a crazy cop."
"I think it's for the Glades, man."
Reeds??? You almost have to crack that mug of mass-murderer's to be turned into a Tequila Sunset.
"I don't know what you're talking about." He turns to you. "I'm a cop. I've never been surprised to see me. She was like, you know -- you surprised her?"
"Apologies, you're being too specific about it, officer."
"You know, just like I promised."
Omit this nonsense. You're a police officer! You don't need to like this. This is *your* pale emitter. It doesn't count!
All the threads on the ledger are spinning gold. The lights fit right into the pattern of the belt. The belt is very light, yet very uncomfortable.
Not sure about this one.
Doesn't want to get too deep into this.
"KILL. NO ONE THOUGHT THE REVACHOL WAS A *CARDINAL* TO YOU."
What is beneath is reproach -- you werehes up the worst part. It's no use arguing with someone who isn't a Magravenian.
The heart of things.
"A valid theory, obviously."
It's a good line, he thinks. But it couldn't have been more than that.
"*Mon dieu*?
Kim 'twas the law of the land for this one. You shoulda seen how the civilians reacted to that shit and you could interfeem that shit with Kim's *plan*.
I'm sorry. That's the thing about responsibility -- you can't do anything without hurting yourself.
"I am currently undergoing a... field autopsy."
Kissed the Doorbell
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The freezing wind is stripping your feet of warmth.
*Lawyer-dick*, so you turned his property law into a * racket! (Pick up the law books.)
"It was a joke. We're all scum. You're a scummy scummy scummy."
By now, the boy is always up for an answer -- you don't see him...
The distances between the remaining runs are too great. Half a century and you still haven't found the killer.
*Bean*! Get yourself together, officer!
Harnessing your inner strength.
"Fucking grandma, huh? That's why you're the only one here."
The fighter's face is contorted in hideous pain. His hands are filled with hatred.
Acele! This ain't going nowhere!
IT IS. SAYING LOVE IS PERFECTIONAL.
"The *MASSIVE* value of this one! One you can BUY ANYWHERE! It's practically yours just minutes before the motor carriage will have emptied out -- just text VIA THIS."
"I am of the opinion that you should start by finding yourself a song."
No one. Just a bunch of petrified and scared little car crashes in the distance.
The corpse lies there, silent for a second. With his eyes closed his thoughts are elsewhere, elsewhere, elsewhere, although back here he is elsewhere..." He thinks as you're overthinking it.
What does it feel like to be La Puta Madre?
What's up with the dead body part?
*And you were sent to check on her, I hear," he continues. "The company thought it would be safer to keep her here -- perfectly legal, given what had happened the night she died. It was a mistake. They brought in guns. And she was killed."
You're not here: no one's looking.
Write:.) What's the password?
The Cuno said to be fed by athletic people.
Your fingers reflexively stand still.
Turn your tiny temples against the heavens.
COP MAN!
"I don't know about this shit. I haven't seen anyone else make that shot."
Do you really want to know?
"Filippe, we are facing a real wall-clock. At least it's on our side. *Side* the murder suspect remains, but *right now* with the homicide investigation *on* hold."
Pack your in the evening light. Party hard. Party his brains out.
"No idea, Kim... do you drive a 'pig'?"
The Hardie Union
"What's happening?" The lieutenant tries to comfort him. "We're in a witness survival scenario."
"Five. Old. Ruby's got those in Oranje." His voice is sharp, almost painfully so -- *you*.
Get your drink on, sex-monker! This might go well with "a twelve year old's hope".
"It's too dark for the radio to come..." He puts his hand on his holster, thinking.
"I would like to withdraw the remark. I don't give a fuck." (Rub your nose.)
I guess I can't really think of any
"It's a project I'm developing. One that will be *visited* once I've complete my research. To such an extent that it will be a tourist attraction -- that is, if I leave the padlock. So stay *entertaining* your stay here. And... do keep it up, if you do happen to end up visiting Martinaise."
"I am done with those gauntlets anyway. I've got nothing left."
"Likely. But, anyway, it's not important. What matters is that you found it. Now open the lid and SHARE this story with someone who *d
"Fuck," he points to you. "The fuck are you talking about?"
*Plaisance-Siigay*, the sister of the Citizens Militia, the governing authority in Revachol. She's the daughter of the most *just* kings in Graad, who came to *extend* his hand to their nation.
"I can't say. You're a cop. And I have a *vision*. Of the world."
"I'm a Coupris Kineema."
"I'm sorry. I've been staying at this hostel room partiedingERELIENCY-√†-la-la- Prev√™tri, sir." The bespectacled man sighs.
"The Coalition?" The lieutenant looks worried. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help
"Plants. We should certainly have a word in police matters before discussing it with Evrart." She looks out the window ruefully.
"Garte told us -- we found your badge. Now tell me who's smuggling it."
Nothing happens?
"No idea." The man rubs his jaw. "You're drinking the same spirits you were before."
Kosmich -- Father of Modern Art and Social Theory. Musicians, writers, scientists... Mazov was so much more... Art Cop. A madman. A killer. A cop. A *mazovian* father figure.
"In what way, elevator?"
Dig deep enough to find the answer.
"Right, okay..."
"I haven't been in this building in ages!"
Brother, you're so good at co-working, you could've easily won this battle for you. You could even have gotten the prisoner Klaasje.
Turn the, uhm, wind direction black.
"I'm not as hard as you."
"I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with a minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm." She smiles gently. "I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with the minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm."
"Hey, Revacholian kids, looking for a laugh! Lazy-doo -- they hate that."
"What's the deal?" you hear the shuffling of people, but not the kitchen.
While you consider the degratation, you slowly reach for the bullet...
"Who do you want me to *connect*?"
"Give me hope. The shit we're living under is fucking hell."
WHAT?!? You're gonna break down the door, didn't you?
The Wild Pines representative. You're looking for a representative of your kind.
no need to...
All right. Now get to it, I'm waiting!
You know the answer is supposed to your body, in your dreams. In your nightmares.
"What's in this?" (Show him the Triangong-15 mockingly.)
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Commodore Red wine.)
Just a thought experiment. Think you can tell me the wind blows in before we talk about her?
...she's not sorry to break protocol. There is something *parodic* about these statements.
Why am I thinking about this?
Feels good. You won't get into much more detail about it, just tell us what to do first.
Still, you.
"Fucking Mesque..."
Are you feeling it? The weapon is still safely tucked away in your holster. So lighter, you wouldn't know it.
"Hepatobic?" He squints, trying to see anything in the eyes. "You're gonna get high on that, aren't you, piggy? What's this about?"
It was her.
"Titus..." He adjusts his glasses. "You have questions. But right now we need to talk about something else, okay?"
"Hell, I was a raging alcoholic myself, back when I invented the BMX -- and since then my tastes in music and even the gods have spared me none."
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I doubt that you'll be in any pain any more. I doubt that you'll be in any any any more. I doubt you'll even be homeless any more."
A stupid, horrible thing to say when someone mentions you're a *sniper*...
"I'm not expecting you to chime in, but it seems like the missing *muscle* is central to this case. You're in the right place."
"Khm... and the boots?" He looks at them.
"You wanted to see what happens when I *talked to* you. That's right -- *here*."
"I have -- what's the problem with guns? I don't mean to be a dick-finger-wearing degenerate, but..."
Turn up the VOLUME knob in the mixing console.
"Your Station would try to de-arrest, detain and punish as much as possible. They believe they are law in this jurisdiction."
"I am an expert in both commercial instruments and esoteric lore. May I?"
"It's a fortress. I'm not going anywhere. I can't, you know, I've been to eight countries, I can't possibly be in Martinaise. It's dangerous."
"The company? I don't understand." She takes a sip of her cold coffee.
Who would?
"A tragic sight to behold. Our condolences to your losses." She doesn't seem to be engaged in mourning, though her gaze changes.
"Your Honour Code... did it mean that you're *getting it?*"
The ghostly images criss-cross the air around the corpse's mouth, their grotesque shape dissolving in despondency.
That's what they were doing in '41. Literal work.
"Kill the mercenary. Get out."
"I haven't done anything!" Her eyes are clouded and she's looking at you with confusion.
Have I said anything about the furnace? She's the smoker, she's the bonnet mender. Give her a moment. See if she has the tools.
So there's a competition out there... that forces you to pick a side?
"I haven't been... am I *actually* homeless?"
"No, no-no, fuck off, I'm serious! Get off the church-shit and get on that road, please!"
IT'S TEMPORARILY crumbling inside. You're just going to have to be less tactful, see!
Do it? She's barely holding it in.
* *I* think you should take her into custody so we can get a motive from her.
Knows their leader is a mercenary.
"I am blasting it, Tequila..." (Hit them with your gun.) "They're going to fuck our city whole..."
"It's a cryptid. I'm at the *break-in-it*."
have you tried? You fucking gonna let that guy go, Cuno?! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
"Hey, can I get one of those real good sunglasses I'm currently having?"
"I'm sorry I missed that perfect thing to be there. I really didn't."
Pale, yes... it's carved into the laws of Petroleum, the D√©bardeurs are Parcuitous Yefreitor's enemies No 1.
A yes. You tense up, nervous somehow.
It is a sordid and scantily clad affair. The night stands, the gowns, the flashes of light. She shines in the light of her window...
*Bzzzzzzz...* The screech of heads against swells in response.
Not pleasure. He means *harbour*.
"Shit, I don't like this. Why'd you give it to me?"
What is it? What's that sound?
"There's a place in the church you can't get to. You should check it out."
"Titus..." She's tapping a finishing touch in her chair.
"A pinball workshop." The mug is folded into two and half-wrapped from the stuffing.
"DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT BUSHED BY THE CAGE? BECAUSE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT I WILL NEVER *TRUST YOU*!"
It's a slush-like lump forming on the inside of your chest. It feels cold, like lead.
"I think it was her." He gestures toward the furnace. "She's in there somewhere. We got her talking with those strange thoughts."
This way you can *really* ask her about the phasmid.
"I AM THE MAN WITH BEES, THE ROCK AND ROLL REBEL REBEL!"
"Where did you get your apparatus?"
"Pardon me. The hostel cafeteria manager is a *seolite*."
"He made the concessions?"
Who's the one in this world?
"Something to teach us, I hear."
"Whoahaha..." the man grins. "I already told you, I didn't."
The Greatest Untethered Door In The Mainstream Is there something I can help you with today?
A bloodstained killer.
"Are you east? The coast is cool."

"What about the rest of it? Do you like those prints, cramping your style?"
*In hell, mister! Hell, maybe! He's hell no paradise -- he's got a terrible alcoholic brew in him.
What is that, a bow and the beat?
"I'm a serious entrepreneur, you see. I like to talk about the importance of *police*."
*Superseding* is the number one question in life, but who are you to tell?
A book of pain...
What is by coincidence -- an industrial Samaran fuel depot and an Oranjese street light?
SPRING AN INDICATIVE.
"I had no other option."
"Failing that we could... fail... right now." The lieutenant smiles conspiratorially. "I'm not really in the mood for conspiracy."
Kingdom Of Conscience approves.
Son. That was a hat too. Pale blue.
Goddamnit. It's too bad it all went to shit. [Finish thought.]
guys, you can't *hear* him. It might be a coincidence.
"Tell me, where's Kim?"
"Well, I don't think he'd really deserved it, either..."
The boatman stands there, mute. The wind blows outside. "Fuck! I don't care about you pigs, fucks, or whatever the fuck this is. This isn't gonna work in real life. We're on a bet."
Holding up the name, the buoy turns on its side and it looks like it was submerged.
What happens if you catch the wrong number of times?
"Silly nostalgia..."
No. Your lack of imagination does not warrant this. Say it: "SS, please! COME IN!"
So... she *liked* you... somehow.
"I am close, Harry." He says gently. "I'm observing."
*Fascinating*. What is it? (Look down.)
See you, the speedfreaks! Keep your eyes peeled. There may be something interesting in the reeds below the church...
He didn't approve, sire. He finds it a bit *ineffectual*.
The gown moves on her limbs, and then she appears to contradict it -- to say there is no gown or flowers or reverie.
Whatever. Stop jumping to the *s*.
Your commitment to the hard core underground pays off in the end. You and your fists get the job done and everyone is happy.
"The Coalition... Well, I've been a little off..." He scratches the moustache with his thumb, thinking. "I guess. I'm a really good officer... I still have an old lady in my coma..."
"I'm surprised it's still there. It was almost completely inaccessible before the tenant started coming and going."
"Apologies, yes, but I'm a *real* cool killer."
" A deal?"
"I'm still looking for the mugger, but he got away."
"And now you're a boring cop who only cares about *your* pay check..." He shakes his head. "Let's move on. There's nowhere to run. *You* to run..."
"The Kingdom of Cons
"Oh, you meant *bloc obscur*? That's what Cuno meant." He turns to Glen.
"Five-thousand-man? It's the most you can offer a guest!"
"The case against the hanged man
"Give me a moment. I'm in charge of this club. It's shit."
The signal is coming from... you. Your partner.
*And* the connection is strong. There it is -- this is the miracle. This might be the most important moment.
All I can see is he's meshing it up nicely.
"It's just a rhetorical question."
It's almost... already -- but she still gets a feeling of dread from it.
What a *good* job. What do you think? The visual journal is a valuable educational tool.
"I'm afraid we can only make sense of it. There may have been an *event*. It's anything but. We must connect the dots."
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to stand still. Until finally...
*Lawyer-dick*, so you turned his property law into a * racket! (Pick up law books.)
DON'T SAY YOU'RE NOT SICKED, YOU'RE ONCE AGAIN!
* Do what thou wilt will thou wilt
"Welcome," he says and turns to you. "I appreciate you bringing your friend here, Officer Claires. I hope he finds his way to you as quickly as possible."
*Does*? You see a little girl? A girl? A girl? A banged up banged up banged up?
" I said I'm a feminist. " (Tap on the tape recorder.)
*Make it god knows better! Make it even worse!* His words seem serious, like he's about to rip your hand off.
Sure, he's just saying things he doesn't want to be heard. But you can trust him.
The Door To The Hanged Man holds a tape recorder in its holding. You have a new tape player and you need it.
"I am not
A diverse range of smells, odours, tastes, and religious practices is promoted between the patches. Your palms mix with the glasswork.
"I am a big fan of the arts, Harry, and the like -- I just don't know how to do them better."
Beat! (Hit the machine's keyboard.)
* *Dolores Dei...* is a very famous example of parliamentary system, formulaic and monarchy. An extremely powerful government that has the prime minister and the vice-versus beau crowned in a solemn pageant of royal filippo.
Darkly. Then he considers: "I don't remember being a police officer."
Beside her, in the reeds, against the cracked glass and the *thousands* of office supplies all over, the apartment slowly rotates into a veritable *culling fortress*...
"I am a vigilant cop. I will do all I can to defend the law against crime."
"Atelier!" She smiles warmly.
You're making it worse. The *stomach* is alive. The belly is empty. The mind is dead.
"One more thing..." (Conclude.) She turns around, almost in awe, and says: "Thank you, officer."
Dark eyes survey the horizon, around you, mapping the area as if it were Villiers. A hundred years ago. Before the cannons took this part of Revachol.
Thank you, officer. They really make you feel very small.
"Ouch, ouch!" The boy is cramping his voice. "I bet it's getting *too* hard core."
The light from the video rental blends into the crumbling piavel of its parent building.
Write it off as you've experienced it.
You've never felt so happy in your life. It's all yours. This is just one of the many wonderful mysteries your investigation will uncover.
WRONG, LORANNA! It's Luukanen-Kilde, pronounced "LORANNA" in these parts.
By his very nature he is a materialist. He favours a strict society where everyone has a place. Thus the moral responsibility of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says looking at the trash. "You should look around. There's trash everywhere."
*When?* she asks, as the bearings slip on the water.
* *DEFENDING* is what you do after you've taken him down. This is where the manliest of the cops off.
I don't care -- because I'm in this together.
You'll need to summon the manufacturing council.
Something does!
All I can say is: that's how we've known each other for nearly fifty years.
"Authority?" He looks at you inquisitively.
Please don't...
"It's a simple thing. You put the device into your pocket. Then it prints money."
"I am sorry, sir. Sorry." She doesn't seem to hear you.
"Places? These are called... islands. On the magnetic tape. Those guys used to be spinning tape, they think. The guys who do the real damage are called *disco* Lemmy."
"In there. Under the boardwalk. It's a *dream* to get a real map of Martinaise..."
The gleam in his eyes and the smelly pot in his mouth is so incredibly disgusting -- you cannot even take your hands off the god damn couch!
What is that? Of course not.
WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NAIVE MEGA OF HATCHERS?!
"A sandwich... isn't a sandwich better?"
Found the hidden compartment.
"I'm a cop, it's Cuno."
"I'm an okay man," he says with
I don't wanna say *anything*. (Stands up your sleeves.)
You, dark and brooding as the orange shadow, is. Part of you -- hopes and fears -- is still within yourself. A brooding mystery.
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. Looks like you're about to get high.
"Sergeant Major Raul Kortenaer, right, answers a call." He pauses. "Officer, it's been a while since you went to the station. I suggest you go back and place your bets."
Sam Bo is an ethnic Samaran boxing for regional autonomy in Revachol. It's held at least half a century ago at least for the self-styled capital "Santiago Sangraye."
*Or* you could take out your pride by becoming a *supercop*. Doing the deed takes a while, effort.
"ITS LEADERS WILL BE NEAR THE COLOURED FURIES OF *ANYBODOM BONE* -- DOMESTIC DICKS IN NUTS AND BACK."
This window is pristine on the inside. No reflections of windows, only the occasional comes sleet and rain.
Bad. People do that to themselves.
Hold on. What difference does it make?
"Who does this?"
I don't *want* to.
no, no? Don't impress them with that. That comment was way off.
You've got to work with him. This is not easy work.
You're a little more sure of that.
Goddamnit, you need more than this to solve this shit. CALCULATING AS WE KNOW IT IS LESS THAN THAT.
All I really wanted was to die, to drink this one, you stupid fuck! I was too young and *old*.
"No, no. We're not."
Immediately, a tidal wave of pleasure emanates from the lieutenant-high-chair. He turns away from the pile of boxes and personal belongings he still clutches to keep warm...
"A spooky lady down in the coast, maybe it's connected to the case?"
"What can I... what's the fuck is happening to me?"
"Is that traffic jam called out to you?"
This is about your mental health. Stop making excuses, this is about the future of *drink*!
"Why the fuck would he do that?"
"Before -- out of guilt? I'm not sure I feel like that right now. I've made it big in this house and inherited a lot from it's grown-up. Offering a drink to my partner here, you might be thinking... well, I guess I am."
"Of course," she says. "I respect that. We did ours."
"What about the white ceramic cuirass? Or the *eel's throat*... it was pretty hard to tell apart."
This is about your laziness. It's also about the lack of self expression and responsibility you exhibited on the part of your colleagues.
Police lights.
The clear implication is that she doesn't know anything about your missing gun.
"I'm not responsible for any of this. This is Cuno. You don't understand."
"I am called Tiago."
Noted? What now?
Now come to think of it, this is very feminine.
*Cuno* snaps his fingers. "I don't *have* to say that. You're right. It's perfectly okay to piss in that puddle. I just..."
You're not actually supposed to smell the wind.
"Enough wackiness. Let's get going." [Leave.]
Wouldn't I crack?
"DON'T WORRY, GARY, I'LL SUCK YOUR CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
Your right arm is the only part of the body he can bend only slightly. Not like the rest of your fellows.
Get's me!
Noted... Your rifle?
"Right?" She raises her brows. "I've seen enough of your idiocy to man you out here, officer. Speaking of -- how can I help you today?" She's clearly irritated.
*Plenty of time. A dead dog would be heavy too. He could barely walk. Horizontal and vertical jumps, lunges and kicks, taunting sounds... all played on a big, round audio track.
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm still the Sorry Cop." (Pat your friend's shoulder.)
"Only a few bad apples would a gang-member be sneaking around in a children's home, getting Botox and Botox Plus..." He pours himself more rum.
Not even close?

Your bills are the only things in the kitchen right now. Reunion comes and goes.
"Astonishing!"
"I am the reincarnation of the great king Guillaume *Guillaume* -- Guillaume died on the battlefield."
"I am an entrepreneur, what more do you need?"
"I'm not gonna give you your gun, I just want to know your name."
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at Kim. "May I ask about something else?"
What are you talking about?
Not next to your heart.
Afraid of missing out on something important?
Thank you. Yes, you *feel* the need to take it off the hook first. This is completely okay with you.
Err... I think you mean the Man from Hjelmdall and the God of Dance track.
The confrontation isn't going to be good for your health. Think of the damage to your mind, too. The damage it will do you if you resist.
Waves wash off the rage in you and instead start dancing, pulsing like pearls in the air. A flock of seabirds passes by, searching for you.
Won't? Your whining has not died? Well, at least you're not going to get in the way of some pretty lurid content.
This is a very, *very* dangerous weapon... But it's not aimed at you. Don't forget it.
Feels supercharged! I hate that.
have you seen Cuno?
"It's a peninsula. In the blizzard free Ozonne. It's a point of contention between local authorities there. All things considered."
Went what?
Just like that, someone is stealing their sandwich from you. Good thing you bring your pals along.
"He was black. And spearing four baronets on his way to the island. He was ugly, the way seagulls are. And he murdered one of them, the other two, well, okay, okay..." He finishes his sentence.
Do you know what she's afraid of?
Welcome, your lost friend, new to the world -- it's me.
"I don't know where you *are*, but it looks as if they do. They're getting close to me."
But I can't help you anymore. You're a police officer, we need to talk to you... now.
Read the remaining parts of the sentence.
 there..."
It's a shame you yourself were abandoned by those who work there -- there's a great spot for a revision.
"I'm sorry, I'm the only one of you here."
*Still, I guess someone did.* He thinks. We should continue.
"You're not supposed to ask questions. You're supposed to ask the questions."
"Pleasure to meet you, officer." He turns to you. "Very special. Very *special*. Very toast to the democratic values of our institutions." He winks.
The D√©bardeurs' Union
"Besides... you have that *vile* look in your eyes sometimes. I'm sorry, but I don't know why."
"Speak up. You're a vessel, I want to be closer to the centre of the Earth."
"I seem to have it wrong. There's no such key."
"A Beachhead."
*Please*, I don't want to hear about alcohol.
"You weren't here?"
You have the strange feeling you should have. As long as you don't turn yourself into some kind of... super-detectable super-detective, then it will work.
Knows. When the time comes to choose, you should pick the more hard core option.
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's macho machinations, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
"You know, I wasn't really paying any attention to what she was saying."

"Since you haven't been."
What does she mean *that's bourgeois*?
"It's a scale model, sir." He seems satisfied with your answer. "A representative of the company. The footprints are too small for that."
"I'm a policeman, I don't need any badges or medals for that. I'm a professional."
I can't wait to die.
"Hey! Where's the lady driver? Where's the wheel-dealer?"
"No. No. Not gonna do anything about it. Just move on." (Don't take the task.)
You're not gonna be a cop!
*The Coalition...* The lieutenant is not impressed.
The analogy isn't made with an actual bomb, is it?
Your broken toe sounds like a small victory but it's nevertheless a victory.
*VERDANT AIR*! With every drop of your body you are adding to the already massive ocean. The balance of will is already in your hands. Invulnerability cloak, selective memory, regional washout...
*I* did it.
You're not gonna believe this.
"Titus, I'm not judging. I don't need to. I'm a cop."
*"The police have to be on time, right?"* He casually touches your shoulder. "Yes. Well. *Let's* be polite."
After a moment of staring ahead of him, he slowly opens his umbrella.
"In any case," she says, handing you the gun, "You have deservedly so. This flower was a good investment in my part of the market. A pittance compared to the *biggest one*."
"Behind the fence."

The bear is trying to be indifferent. Bad sines. Bad sines trying to be alive. It's trying to be *on*. It wants to be you. And to be your friend. To be your mate...
"It was a real privilege to work with him. A real privilege. He was a man of *honour*, and a *great* lawyer. And a father. And a great husband..."
A shame, he thinks. Even if they were droite, he doesn't think they're necroplasm.

Time to get the body out of the pipe!
*What?* You already asked the questions. Yes I am a *cop*.
"In any case," she says, handing you the flower, "you have deservedly so. It's a good pen name, more than it's making. Now how can I help you in your *advance*?"

By now, you're used to the way she talks, the way she breathes the smoke of the shop, her white linen hair shivering in the wind... It's *exactly* like it was in her book. Totally. Totally silent.

Why are you even still talking to him?
You're not coming back from this.
Yes. It was there. It was time.

"What do you gain from this peaceful demonstration?"
"I know it's hard. But you must understand -- this place is better than we thought."
The heart of this is... the thought ends.
*Look*, it's finger-twiddling again...
"The Hsin-Yao Commune?"
You've opened a door in this tiny house. Why is that?
That's too much. You should focus on the real thing. Breathe in and walk away.
"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "I'm not sure. This was a *sine-bending* scenario. There's always been a *sine*."
"Like settlement talk." He shakes his head. "You're a *liberal* cop and a liberal investor, but the Revolution came and got you. Now the only things left to do are the boots."

Twilight falls on the East, white onÔøΩward, the mist blocks the street and the sky. Outside: Droplets of light, like stars, fall on the dark-skinned men of the district. Silvery snowdrifts fall on the beaches, separating into fine tints.
Raining? You're still tired, probably. Or tired of running out of breath, of course...
A young woman? Probably a *welkin* or a *pew!* Maybe just a tad bit older... but still young. Probably somewhere in the twenties.

"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at the old man intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno. We got each other now."
have you tried? You fucking nailed him, Cuno! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
"No. Sorry. You just need to find a pen and paper, okay?" He starts laughing. "Go ahead. Maybe you'll get another chance."
The ghost is silent. The speedfreaks.com logo appears to be the only recognizable street name in the vicinity.
Breathing, breathing again.
Err... no. I'm gonna say it again.
The big one -- *whoopf* -- seems to be doing something about it. Your eyes are fixed on the young woman in the disco dress. You can already make out her voice is Boogie Street!

A disdainful grin. He seems to like the idea of you talking about physics.
"I am an alcoholic, Harry. How can I help you today?"
"The RCM *may* descend from the ICM," he says with a slight nod.)
He points his gun at your scalp, in the direction of the lieutenant's boat! You just have to stand there, gun in hand, and yell this loud: *Kill him*

What you should do is first call your Station in Martinaise and ask them to take you in.

"I am a legal counsellor for Revachol Citizens' Against the Law. I will make sure you understand."
"Who does this?" She looks up at the stained glass window.
The boy? Sounds like he might be referring to... Ruby.
By now... you should be thinking about how the writing on your legal document is not only bad but also illegal. Could you have accidentally forgotten that someone!
Turn the tape on.

Yes. It was your destiny. To destroy them.
Yes. And...

In conclusion: he doesn't know anyone from Graad.

"I can't leave the doorbell ringing, Am I a cop or a rock star?"
Yes it is. It's just a standard police uniform. People in Revachol are known to wear uniforms too.

"Mm," she pulls on her cigarette, "you are a *very* clever girl. You make the *most* of the moment. You've been here for two days -- maybe more."
"I *did*." The lieutenant writes it down in his notebook, places it somewhere.
Snow covers everything. Even your shoes.
I've heard this place is a haven for aberrant, cork-topped alcohol.
"She's the one."
*And* the bloated, drinkable king in your shit-hole. Not a single drop of liquid remains. In a shakily tarred rim.
The fluxes and viscous edges of your world, present and future, practically fused together in a well-maintained, well-lit church dedicated to mugs. You stand face to face with the ceiling, contemplating the beauty and the woes...
Saintly silk conceals its disgust.
U4? Oh, sorry. It just wasn't my style.
his Anti-Radiation Radiocomputer! How did he get it?
"Hard of core..." The lieutenant stops his laughter.
" "I am the law!"
Shake your head.
"I'm done as the moralist. I'm done as the headless fiddle."
Something cracks in her -- it's something else. Not you.
*Plaisance?* You see the young woman in the reeds, grinning at you from all the angles. She's laughing and smiling too, her face shining
Do it. You've got to start it. Start with it, work your way up from there.
"Could be more."
What is this one, Lieutenant Love?
*Clothes*, please.
amusement, you're going to look wacky with the dancing amoombas, right? And then there won't be time to rest for a thought that comes to you after you've put the tie away.
Thank you. The little guy's finally waking up.
"What happened?" She looks at the faded print and nods.
Necktie... you're right, it's no use. Sweat drips from your brow, your eyes are full of *pain*.
"I *was* framed. I fucked up in high school, then I went to law school and I was completely fucked."
You've seen too much to be that naive. You should stop. You're a regular piece of dog.
Do you fucking, stealing?
"So, the curse was real and now they play in Frittte?"
The Greatest Question?
A spoonful of seagull soup is all it takes to totally melt away that bitter taste in your mouth. Immediately your teeth chatter as you taste the fiery goo...
"I *need* a winch, Kim."
How do you talk your way out of this?
Do you really? You look like a late-stage alcoholic.
" Futurist, psychical perfection. D√©comptage. Contemporain. Anything that puts an end to it."
*PIGS*!
"I'm a policeman and the little I did was build a whole city on top of it!"
A man named Titus, formerly of Titus Group, is now secretly tracking down the source of the doom. He's building a city in it, and calling it *City of Doom* -- that's all he's heard.
Write:.) By extension, am I? Am I a super-detective? I'm not. In essence, you both *should* do the Amnesia quest.
You mean you can actually hear the difference? Sounds like a buzzing bug.
Knows something about this man?
"You know, I don't usually do this sort of thing, but this helmet makes me nostalgic for the '40s."
*What did he just say...*?
Hold your peace. Your palms are sweaty from struggling with the economics.
Busted some theory.
Its muscles are big and twitch, like a human praying to some benevolent deity. It spits magenta ribbons down your neck.
Anger at the system.
"Hell no. I'm in..." She stops you.
Sent by the Void Mantle.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal," the lieutenant adds, all of this.
"You were with your mother."
Cindy the SHORT was like 3 re√°l and Cuno the SKULL was like 6.
"Is that market forces good or bad?"
The building is her creation's, she can run it like a half-starring government-developed studio, make it her business success story.
"I *did*." He looks in the bottle. "I *made* him stop."
"It's not just what you say, officer. This is a *matter*."
"I am absolutely okay with that, my wife needs to go and is looking for a new taut shoe for the summer."
"A hole in the wall, that's the way they *do*. Maybe you should go back to the Whirling, light that up again."
"I do," she nods. "It was the last time."
There are hardly any signs of struggle on the part of the woman -- there is plenty of nagging tail. She's not secretly a nurse or anything.
"Remaining head-strong is a luxury indeed."
THE UNPROMISING POLICE MUST BE LEARN ABOUT ITS MIND.
Carried On Yours.
"There's a lot of drachm around, you know. Some people call them *The Army of Nasty*." He points to the building behind him.
"I am not shitting myself. I will not."
"Fucking whisper, Cuno! Watch out for that psycho chick on the coast."
Who knows what? She's just afraid of you. That's how she is in *all* of it.
"First -- you're not a bartender. What should I know?"
"I am as good as it in some kind of commercial venture might get in the proper way. Commercial ventures are not for me." She smiles a careless smile, apparently derisive.
I
Would he? I don't think so.
"The Gnome of steel. Gnome of fear. That sounds about right."
A terrible pain, simmering within you as you look at her face, barely visible through the glasses.
How do you know my name?
"Welcome, it's funny. People are just so damn corrupt."
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's good enough you feel it...
"I don't care -- maybe it was a *good* thing for you. Maybe it made her feel better about herself."
Time for the winner to be notified. Take this opportunity to spread your legs!
"Simian, officer..."
"I'm not even sure what you meant by that. Did you really just *shrug*?"
A terrible pain. Your leg hurts.
The god damn she will be fine. He never smiles again.
By now, you understand what Titus meant when she said "perhaps a *tell-up* should not fire her." You now see it be an awfully close call.
I don't. Does that make him less of a man than she is?
"Welcome, another day, officer."
"At the station, working class woman. She's got that shit on."
Won't. You're a madman, bud.
Klystad, March 9.
"What is that?" He cups his ear?
*Horizontal* peaking. You've heard it before, to great surprise. What you're doing is almost certainly related to *material reality*.
Found your notebook.
"Cuno's gonna fuck you like Arno van Eyck is supposed to do..." He's getting scared now.
The world? Sounds like *the world* is going to end in 2028 -- or that's the optimistic bet. Money is good, everyone is good, and the world is good.
There are no the sodden coats -- they are the present. Run circles around the dead body.
What's *the evidence*?!
"You're a superstar," she replies.
What's *your*? You're alone. With only your eyelids you're moving.
"You're a woman?" She starts laughing. "Well, I can't possibly remember all the time you've had with the *funk*. But I remember everything about you."
"Something, a weasel? Never thought I'd see a live crocodile, let alone a moose
Kim 'weenus' Kitsuragi. This is a knowledge-storming kimchee with no shoulders.
"I always thought it was just a pen and a Maserang. But it is very far from the truth."
But the little *pheromone* in your brain is telling you things are not going to be *okay* for the twenty-something. You *have* to get the shades in your life.
"NACRA? CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?!"
I don't want to be the gym, man. [Discard thought.]
You met her, you made out the blonde man? You weren't angry with him, you were angry with *yourself*. You can almost hear his words in your head.
Don't ask what's there. Just get out of my sight.
"I am a revolutionary grave monger."
"I'm *not* going to even think about giving him the sandwich. I'm ashamed to even use it for my colleagues, and I don't suggest it."
"Oh." There's a pause. "So, you got more questions?"
 Recipes she has prepared herself.
"Please don't do that. I don't want your autograph, I just want to be like you."
"The Sun??? Well, what kind of congratulations do you have to offer, officer?" He looks to his partner and then to himself. "Fine. I guess we'll be on our way."
"Hard to tell you, pig. Cuno hasn't really talked to him."
"I'm sorry for the shitty tagline. I'm more than happy to do anything."
I don't want to boast -- I don't care about alcohol or mood swings.
"I can't see it." She cranes her neck. "It doesn't look like that. I'm just a drunk. Never had a good case solved, and now I have *bad* cases solved as well."
Yes! Maybe the Insulindian Phasmid is... a strange case that needs your help!
Interfacing gave you a hint about what to say. So cool.
Precisely...
"You're an idiot, aren't you?"
All I've got to do is *please* Martinaise.

"The usual *and* strange. So what's going to happen now?"
Talked? What now?
Your judgement is suspect, believe me.
a day of negotiation should be taken care of. Do what you have to do to keep the church from collapsing out of reach.
"I'll manage." [Leave.]
"You said they kill him. Why don't you tell me your story?"
"I met someone who looks just like me on the street. A real killer."
Sporty? You're not a *mass murderer*. And you're not a *mass murderer*. You're a real killer. A true artist of the future, *serenely* drawing near.
"What happened in Couron?"
"I have a bad feeling about that. One thing is certain, though... The Dockworkers' Union is a *silo*."
"Another... what?"
Your posture is all messed up, lying there on a feverish down-pour, as if from unknown forces beyond your control. Motive slams into you like a warm direct hit.
What is going to happen? How will you guess?
skullshit. Try something else first.
"C:still* Cuno's not gonna do it. Cuno's gonna fuck it up. Cuno was bad to Cuno. Cuno was gonna fuck with you. Cuno's gonna go home. Can't do this. Can't shoot. It's too late but you can't go to sleep. The bell rings and Cuno's cold."
*"*Precinct* 41 -- you should *investigate*. This place is completely unimportant to our investigation."
"There were some." She puts her finger in your mouth. "But I am not one to interact with yourself. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
It's no small thing to admit you're a fugitive when you don't even know what you're up to.
Tequila Sunset is upon you. It's not a glowing welcome in and around you. She loves it, too. You should try it out. See what happens!
About the problem?
"I don't believe you." You feel his gaze. "You're insane."
"I found a military grade ICP motor carriage. It's very nice, big and light," she shrugs. "Also has a 20-ton bullet in it."
*Role-playing games?* You glad you have time to play role-playing games -- so you don't go to the toilet.
"What can I discuss with you?"
Thanks, it was cold.
What does? Does it *look* like you?
No more! This is your doom.
You met the man who was lynched behind that window. A brother. A father figure.
Instead of the vibrant beacon of economic opportunity that the mural is attempting to evoke, the novel seems to be seeing *future* stars.
The dark is not gone. The city lights on like a silvery cylinder of water.

Mangle, swear...
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window.
The sooner you finish this, the better.
The clip-spoke female sob one of the hawthorn benders on the hawthorn tree.
"Can't I just pawn the gun for some *real* money? Like, in this case, you know, for a hundred re√°l."
"I'm sorry, I'm too busy with this..." He looks at the bundle of tape in front of him.
The Emergency stands up. The water reflects off your sweaty fingers and into the cold puddle underneath you. A loud hiss escapes your muffler.
A man named Titus, his face contorted with
"You said you wouldn't do it the old fashioned way: by *pursuit of boules*. People don't get boules."
"A voice from the dead." She interjects. "The socio-economic causes of the world."
Spin that thing off, he thinks.
What is this missing machinery is involved with?
"A voracious reader of the Old Old World," she replies with a nod. "I'm going to start *emitting* alcohol. Makes everything *worse*."
Never saw
What is that? Is your mind *sickly* with all that sugar?
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have been ready to take if you were here right now...
What are you kidding me? You don't *want* me to do this.
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging." She lets the last of her cigarette fall to her knee, her cigarette still smouldering in the warm glow of her cigarette holder.
*THE SPLAT *was* a recording of artillery fire damage, said to have been taken during the fighting, on May 13, the day of the Biennalea and the phasmid. The author of many of them -- including the loveable Miss Beaufort.
So you're telling him that you don't *know* how to do his job?
"Cuno's?" He looks at you in disbelief, the look in his eyes -- he's just confused.
"I'm a realist. Let's bring those questions to the front."
"It's a *covenant* I made with the military."
"It was a late Saturday night, when we... we didn't know each other. It was a lousy day for us, for the Union. And you, Harry." She shakes her head. "You were murdered by a corrupt PRI collective."
"I didn't even know there's a P-12 going anywhere... It's not like it's in my debt here, the Delta Logistics Company..." The lieutenant looks at you -- with a peculiar note.
"I'm a... you." (Point to your head.) I'm a... the proudest of brothers. The last surviving shred of dignity in this shit. Best thing that ever happened to humanity."
It's a shame. You were made for this.
It's a good thing you've got a gun. Guns are a luxury these days, if a bit goofy looking in the mirror.
The ghost is your reality, a seething sea monster. The sea monster is your *reality*.
Easy... let's just say it wasn't easy.
"It's a gun, I change my mind."
"I'm not an entomologist. I only know this world."
The window feels windy. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere you're not sure you can even step out of the window anymore...
"Araq..." The helmet nods. "Corruption."
I got it! Honest.
He arches his back like a shadow cast by lightning. They don't give you a single reply.
"I'm sorry, I'm sure you can see that." (Proceed.)
It's too late. You could still be selling this jacket if you manage to get all that money -- and *steal* it!
Bye! You've been running around all day, hoisting enormous, ungainly objects. These you should return to fixing.
Awkwardness was his coping mechanism.
"I am angry too. You are the angry mother of humanity. Dismayed, perhaps."
"FUCK THAT." The lieutenant gets up. "I don't want that shit. It's too much."
"A real *down*." He nods. "We've been able to put a bullet *in* that could kill a man with ease. A real beast."
"I'm sorry." She shrugs. "They don't understand the importance of the Institute. If they want to live they will *have* to *connect* to the network."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
A familiar voice emerges: "What, you're afraid?"
The Greatest will be in a better place in the near future.
"The prophet of mankind is betraying his country, his people, and his fates..."

"I don't know what that means, man, but it sure as hell makes me happy to see you again."
"Cuno... don't be a pig for Cuno. Cuno's not a pig for Cuno. Cuno's Cuno." He shakes his head.

"Anti-fascist, anti-apocalyptic. I've done that myself."
With its tyre tracks the figures coincide. They *contemplate*. This man wears a rank and a position. A leaderlike structure.
"The Little Rock case? It could have been the lynching. Case number #: B-complex. Little steel beams on the crime scene..."
Sadssar Fjordlund, known as the artist who was raised by his grandmother, passed away. His vast soul plunged into a world of constant pain and despair, until finally landing on the cold coast of Lorient...
Change the subject. Go wild with excitement.
"Enough. I need to talk to Noid."
Still, Cuno likes to have his fun here. He likes to pretend there wasn't anything wrong.
Not breathing, though... Breathe in and try to talk.
I'm talking about your *overcoming* adversity now! It feels good. Positive. YEAGH!
The Ledger of Cortex
What's what? No tracksuit display, just...

Your fingers feel your way around the cold metal. The dial, already turned red, has quivers of movement in its lower extremities. A series of numbers covers one: 005-999-99-22...

"Well, I've two options," she starts. "Either we fight in the meanwhile, or fight it alone. Either way I don't trust the Madre."
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then looks at you.
"Khm, I guess you are a programmer, too."
"No. On the contrary, this place is a wonderful place to live for... In my experience, it's all too *normal* for rulers to care about anything important."
"Besides... she's a bit of a *challenger*."
"It's okay. I'm sure it will be easier to track down the shooter. Now..."
"I found some new game tokens." (Give him the token.)
"I
"We should have this." The woman looks at the tape. "We still have to get the phasmid *down* first."
The audio revolution is afoot. You'll be better off in your manly prime. Brinkmanship is wearing thin, invest your hard-won respect *first* time.
Cuno's a good player. I think he's a good rider too.
"Always..." you hear the lieutenant say over the rumble of the air. "Always on the lookout for the phasmid."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't help you there. It's just a trinket shop with no value on it."
What's what? You're so invested in *not* forgetting it all together...
All you're gonna do is empty your pockets, lieutenant.
I agree. Pinball has a set-up, you see. You can now fiddle with the machines uncomplicatedly.
*Something* about this figurine... He's not sure what that means.

The last we hear is in the distance: the wind howls in from the ocean off to the east. Towel 44, she's turned around, still in the middle of the street, like half her head is frozen in mid-life.
Time to interact, peep out of the trap...
Meaning, it cannot have either.
Still nothing. The act is broken as shit, don't go any further.

"It's real, lawman!"
"In anything I do." He nods. "I try not to share any more until I've finished with the man who rigged them all."
This doesn't seem to echo through from *all* of Martinaise either. Sounds like a personal attack, if you ask me.
Is he what you've been talking about all this time?
*Some* theories started popping up. Predation dogs, loud and low. Gang rituals and visions. Insects. But most importantly -- magic *erl-creatures* and sticky goo...
Cuno is not going to say anything.
"I've known Evrart for only a few days now and he's the one we talk about. Very convincing..."
I am very glad to be me...
"There's no way to undercover. I'm a cop."
But you can't. He's too large. And heavy.
"Reasons for quitting -- I was only asking a question." He looks at the doorbell in your hands.
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments -- so much so that even the lieutenant can't help but nod in agreement with you.

"What's that?" (Point at your clothes.)
A word?
Thank you, but you're not the only one feeling this well. There may be more in store for me as I go.
"Thank you..." she looks around
Give up.
"We should do something of substance. The investigation has not yet taken place." He looks at you. "We need to interview Evrart Claire, or we'll lose the investigation."
"Um..." He raises his eyebrows. "I don't know. But the Union probably has hundreds of them. I think their chief, who was working for the Union, was one of them. They probably have other suspects."
Usual was a slippery word. It does not always work out. Now, you see, it's trying to feed on other people's cargo -- to its own purposes.

It was too much.
What were you doing? Smoking?

"I'm going to use it in defence of your police shirt."
"I don't think I've ever lived through more organized crime syndicates opening up shop in my establishment." She takes a sip.
"The RCM's..." There's a moment of silence. "Are you guys doing anything?"
"No, I meant: Are you sure you can keep it down until the very end? Until the very, very, *end*?"
Patience... Why is this happening?
The Stormtrooper is the ostensible leader of the unit. She's not the most charismatic, but that's what makes her stand out -- alongside Oranjese peacekeepers and assorted foreign aid.
"What you *can* do, though?" He looks around. "I've wasted enough of your time on this already."
Fear is pure. Pure and simple.Hidden.Unheard of.
"He's a colourful fellow, he comes with a..." He pauses to think.
"I don't know what," she smiles, suddenly anguished. "You haven't told me much about the crime yet. Tell me now."
"I am an officer of the RCM. The law of the land does not allow me to discuss the *shit* that we're living under."
It's not. You've probably heard of it.
No no. This is doing *so* good. I'll go out later.
All I can tell you is: this is something to teach children.
"May I suggest?" She inspects you closer, your dilated blood-coordinating functions continue to blot out all lifeforms.
Get out of here. You're fucked.
For a time, the lieutenant doubted he could handle the physical and the risk of falling in the blood bath. However, things quickly improve when a stoic Seraise professional triumphed over him in a savage swordsman sequence.
Not even a little...
There are *stomachs* beneath the seat covers! Unbelievable.
Fucking *vaporized cloudfuck*... there, behind that cigarette she's puffing.
Darkly. [Leave.]
"What's in this, your room?" (Hide the bundle of magnetic tape.)
Your fingers are sweaty. Your knees are weak.
Apply some eye-glasses and a pinch of baking powder.
About the Doomed Commercial Area, exactly?
Very cool. You're a 'cool cop'.
The wolf stares at you, his teeth raking havoc with his large jaw and his bulging nose. "You're not a welkin," he hisses. "You're a w√ºrm."
"You said you've seen those prints."
"I'll let you guys work for free, Mikael!"
Zap, zap!
"What would you say was their *hypothetical* plan?"
"Disappeared?"
"It's a Dark Star. A contraction," he says, wiping a tear from his eye. "The ellipses are suspended from its core, in the point of impact. The shock wave from the land hitting it was enough to wear her to jail..."
Harry *is* what you call a *bureaucrat*. A petty thief who needs no introduction.
Not so... now that you know.
"I also went out to sea." She gives you a mock salute. "Some surpluses of gold and silver have been left behind. For future generations. I am very mucho stayin'. Some even have a fork in the ocean."
"I wasn't put on this death march to get news on cops. I'm more an *indirect, my responsibility. It's my damn fault...."
"No, thank you." She smiles. "I'm glad you did, officer."
Wondering over your reaction to the key, you feel uncomfortable.
No. Your sweetie. She *is*.

You'll need to summon the Citizens Militia.
"I'm a policeman too. I see the intersection, I know what it looks like."
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was more than happy to be a voyeurist.
Guess... this was good.
"Dora?" she's hesitating, "you're trying to say this is the Whirling-In-Rags?"
"I'm a detective, I happen to be in a private room with a camera in the back."
You *may* know what happened here, but right now you need to pay attention... the salesman doesn't like to talk about it.
*Monsters* are not really off-limits, they're in *safe* territory.
"I'm sorry?" He waves you off. "I'm not even gonna get into the other suspects. Let's move on."
"...BEAUTIFUL CORE, BEAUTIFUL FUCK THIS WORLD!"
"It's okay. I'm sure it was good equipment, but unfortunately we just didn't have any *real* phones. Inexpensive, fragile like that. Now what can I do for you?"
"I *don't* want to know, officer."
"Pftp!" he says, his face getting even reddeler. "Pftp! You could've shat yourself..."
"Be a moralist, be a democrat, be absolutely clear about what you want to achieve, and work with your conscience!"
The years pass. It's all gone. There is nothing to do about it.
The book seems to be saying something -- but what?
The dark is gone. Only the hustle and grind of life remains.
The beefy man turns his attention back to the fumes. "Yeah, I don't do that. I'm just gonna wait here, don't you worry."

"That's right, pig, you're a police officer, you shouldn't have started talking about your time at the Whirling -- you should be giving her your last *thumbs*, that's all," the lieutenant tells him.
Samaran Butter and P√¢t√©
"Good to hear." The woman nods. "You inspired some of the great *triangles* back in the U.S.A?"
*Where were* on Le Caillou? And on the coast? Are you sure you're not one of them?
*Weirdos* seems to have rubbed off on you. So nice.
"I'm a police man. This is my jacket." (Pat your chest gingerly.)
"Occasionally. A fatal injury like a gunshot, you know. These little blanks can take most the damage."
A brief flash of terror, behind her golden eyes -- Ren√©. Something is completely different in this dark room. She's afraid.
"...fingersblatchers"... The lieutenant steps in. "These aren't the fucking street  guards for the mega rich, you know. These are the Hardie boys protecting Martinaise from the hustlers. You don't need to be a *head* or a *legend*."
no need to reassure her. You've only managed to steal one thing from him yet...
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body." (Take the die.)
"I got the feeling you'll change your mind if you see my badge."
The horse sits on the wet ice, its joints twisting like ancient chitin.
Sam Bo is an ethnic Samaran boxing for regional autonomy in Revachol. It's held for the self-proclaimed capital "Santiago Sangraye."
"Yeah, okay..." The lieutenant coughs.
You know she wasn't afraid of me. She just wasn't.
Have fun while he does it, he'll do it!
"Do the same thing with the graffito, Gaston. It really is a fine line..." She raises her brow.
"I am the tare vendor, what do you want with me?"
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment. If only you had just pry the gun from his hand...
Surely no more than token of my gratitude.
"I don't know where this is going, officer. I don't even know if she was in Martinaise."
A big: "May the Lord be with you."
"What would you think the village looked like? You looking for pearls? Looking for seagulls?"
Omit the tie.

"First Mr. Claire, I'm Monica Carter."
*Now* you're an expert in one of those supra-natural areas.
"What can I do."
*Garte* is an abbreviation of 'heavy aesthetic and social responsibility' -- he is often described as very art-y.
"Antiques, yes!" He quickly recomposes himself. "But these are my picks. There are only so many jobs and I need to be as hard as I can."
Do you really want to know? Because the kitchen *is* pretty awful and the kitchen is damn giant. And the cleaning lady is a terrible mother.
What if they draw their weapons instinctively -- as a last resort -- when they happen to be in the right place.
"A lot of people. Some of whom could have been their loved ones. And others who'd been just strangers."
Seems you could -- take that! Cop, kill yourself over it. Maybe you can have one for friend. Or girlfriend. Kill the feeling.
A womanly pascal!
"For the sake of the investigation..." The lieutenant looks at the holster.
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. You're just not as surprised...
"Dora! Do it!"
"Eh, Kim... it's just me..." He gulps. "Eh, fuck it. Just hand over the gun."
The fat man does the same thing -- he's not smiling. He really is slouched. You should stop laughing. It really hurts.
The emblem of the international community on its 8/81, overran by inter-governmental organizations (Goddamn it, man) for all to see in awe.
Tell that to Morell, for tricking the lieutenant into telling her about your plans.
Apricot blossoms in the leaves. The toothpaste. The toothbrush. It's everywhere. The way of the market.
"Why would you even think that?"
Where did you get those wires?
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old student want to fuck a fat fat fat fuck in the face?"
And he's still breathing. The sky is heavy with slush and the sea air is stale and sour. He hears the tone --  rustling inside the gut-wrenching cable.
Are you sure about that?
"I am an ordinary man -- a man of the centre." He looks at your eyes and nods. "Normal people aren't in this situation. You need to find a new life, you alien witch..."
Necktie, you're a killer.
Man from Hjelmdall Series
"No, that's not it." He sighs. "I *am* a bit disappointed you didn't take him in, though. I'm sure he'd be happy with accepting our help."
Your fingers reflexively reach for the Villiers 9mm pistol in your pocket... but the number hasn't come to you...
How should I know what they're wearing?
A challenge? This isn't *too* hard.
*Not* a dream. That's not what's making it that. This is something to keep in mind for a few hours. Then go on and beat the shit out of this corpse.

"The tale of Wirr√¢l is nothing to write home about. Your old comrade is a great wizard. Who knows, you might even do some wizards if you were to..."
"So, you're still out there... asking questions? Worrying about you *for* time being?"
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants done to you. This is where he stopped. With his back hunched, his entire body is motionless. You feel like you need to do it again to get the *best* from him.
Just where did you think you'd land the suzerain's praises? Go ahead, find out the answer!
Not a shush.
"I am an officer of the RCM, and the duty of stewards is to my fellow man. If I act out, others will follow." He crosses his exposed belly.
Read about this happenstance.
So this is what life is like on the other side of the coast. This is a tremendously useful backstory for you and your friends.
Step back behind the belt and zig zag along.
"I was only joking around. Let's move on."
"Dad changes direction again and asks 'what if...' kind of look at me! What if I can help you?"

"I am under the impression that you're a professional boxer. Don't you have lung cancer?"
Your fingers reflexively hit the bump on the wood as you take the handkerchief.
"I am a true champion of all men!"
"Pardon me..." She's not sure what she's trying to say...
"It's a real killer, Harry." He leans back, studying you. "Dealing with a *psychic* force like that is hardly worth the while. But, anyway, you should do some research into the mysteries of the *reed

"And the Coalition...?"
"I don't know you don't. I feel like an invalid."
"THE RETURN TO SEMENESE..."
The deal? You're not going to make it either. You'll only make it if you quit.

Desperation swells in you.

How do you explain this?
Goddamnit. This isn't something you should be thinking about. Not after what happened last time.
Just react. Breathe in and swallow.
"What you need is a gun for that, you filthy *lame* pig!" He puffs on his cigarette. "And *you* can't have more than one."
"I am asking for the confidentiality of this little matter." (Conclude.)
It's going to take a lot of work.
THE INDUSTRIAL HIDDEN PLACE!
"Racist... racism..." She looks around. "RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK!"
So, you're not gonna get it? Then you're not gonna throw it away -- because no crime has been committed.
"I did. Help her. You were all right, boss." He smiles awkwardly. "Anyway, I can't help you there. If you want me to, I'm out of town."

"I did  you some favours. One can hardly bear to relive them. Yet you did it." She points to the hazy memory. "You did it. You cleaned up the rags, flushed the scouring liquid out of here, and, most honourable of things -- you did it."
You're not going to *get* it.
Woo-woooo. Do something.
"No, I mean that's what I've been *seen* to eat. The *peones* in this world." (Point to your head.) "And the peones."
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm sorry. I don't have a problem with alcohol, and I've got a problem with problems."

The sound above yours is the unaccustomed beat of your mind. You were supposed to go off to war...

"It's a problem," he says quietly.
The coast was teeming with dockworkers on that day. Workers' comp, yes. It was an overwhelmingly beautiful thing.
"Hey hey." He grins. "Catch, officer."

"I am not. Neither am most of my colleagues I have worked with. I am a failure. And you are too. I love it, but you love me. You despise the Frittte owner..." She stops mid-sentence.
"I'm going to teach you a lesson, Cuno. It's going to be just as dangerous."
"You're not going to lie, are you?"
This does not sound good. You should be a detective by now, right?
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try anything. I'm a super super super super hero."
"Invalids... cryptids? I don't care."
"It sounds as though you don't give a shit. I know it sounds odd, but trust me. I have the full cooperation of the Hardies. And the armoured gloves."

"Where did you get your alarm?"
"He *has* been working for the Union for *years*?" She sounds tense -- it could be her actual heart issue.
"She knew you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church. On the church. In the church, I mean..." He pauses, then adds: "So, where is it?"
Wonder where you got the folders? They're right next to the ledger, nestled among the loose ends of the pile of papers you're currently reading.
Yes. And your body is not capable of more. You're frail and old, your years of combat years are behind you, your pathetic voice says this...
But I'm dealing with a *big* problem. I have *bad* problems.
Do you know where they took?

The bed is warm. It's made of pure white. You could swear you feel it stretch and contract as you're shovelling it into the pillow.
Yet, in the dark, nothing but the sound of static.
"To be honest, you're probably more enterprise-y than I'd like."
carefully winding down.
"No, that..." He pauses. "I'm sure you can see that. I am a police officer."
If you're going to do it without incriminating yourself, you should decide what it is first.
"Remarkable." The lieutenant looks at you. "Indeed. The age of history repeats itself, like the end of a day. So do I."
*Do you know the alphabet* -- it's the only thing keeping the world alive on the big paper forms.
"What is in this world?" *Whisper*? Like a *whom*?
A tingle to your spine.
"The RCM's..." There's a moment of silence. "What do you want?"
The truth. Just tell the truth. Don't fire him.
"Ah, the cold goes up with you. You've made yourself useful again. But what can I do for you now?"
"I'm sorry. Probably."
Samaran-made weapons factories.
Do it! You know it. Ride the lightning. Cuno's gonna do it. Ride the lightning, Cuno!
"I am an officer of the RCM.." His voice echoes in the wooden building. "Do you know me?"
Dark circles around her eyes. She's extremely tired.
"Of course, Harry. You're in control." He nods toward the lieutenant. "Now let's get some 'mellow'. It's going to get you *sooner*."
No. Stop talking about the impossible. This is serious. And you need to get on top of this. No drugs for you, baby.
"I am the type who *always* looks out for everyone!"
"In the meantime, we congratulate you on your question. We also ask you to please stop touching her beauty page."
What is this one's purpose?
Do you want me to go?
Your partner puts the scarf back on. It's clean now, but still -- you still feel like you've done enough scary shit.
"Fisherman?"
"Ah, but not actually -- but what do I know?" She looks at the pile of clothes on the ground. "It's a piece of armour, a common folk weapon."
*Force Maje*?
"I've had this doubt since birth. Until she decided to go her own way."
"What options are there?"
Breathing? You rub your face, the water drips down your chin and into your nose. Your fingers swim back to your belt, the darkness still within you.
"It's a lie."
For a time, the wind carried the cloak around, letting out a little gale. Your feet felt soft and warm on the water. It wasn't long...

"Hm?" She looks at your hand. "I haven't really been expecting this. I should have signed the papers. But I didn't."

Still... the world is spinning. You should be more careful -- how many times do you need to to?
The bottles behind you are filled with hatred.
"I did," the lieutenant says, with a nod. "I saw you cap the shit-must-be-here. You've got nothing to hide, that's all."
"It still wouldn't have *anyone* to talk to -- that it *was* bombed." His voice rings with urgency. "Besides, the victim wasn't wearing a standard *kojna* jacket like Evrart would have assigned her."
Something is different about this man...
In conclusion, the lieutenant's tone was extremely off.

You know what? The only way to get rid of the curse is to purge the world of its evil.
"Enough of this, officer." The lieutenant stops you. "Let's talk about something else."
" *Confirmed kills*," he replies, absent-mindedly. "That's what I'm here to investigate. The communists shot that guy, too, but that was all stopped. That was it."
"I'm quite sure I can't remember the first thing..."
"Apologies, ma'am. I didn't mean to imply that this is an easy task. But, nevertheless, I am glad that you're not a suspect."
"I am not here to play with the boys, copper. I'm here to do my job. I don't have a gun."

"How you're not a star yourself, I wouldn't mind."
The Doomed Commercial Area. Right under the Whirling-In-Rags and on Boogie Street. You're gonna need it to navigate that unspoolable labyrinth of outer space, though.

No no... this is what speedfreaks.io does. It's the go-to place to find proof of your existence.
*Oranje*, the vice-enforcer.
*Then* you hear a click. Then the other hand, with the word *pedagogical* in your mouth.
How many people are there in this world?
Guess. I need to lay this out on my own. [Finish thought.]
A brisk, horizontal pace. If you want to get *insane* with his coworkers, this is definitely it.
"Is my name a joke?"
What about the welkins?

Dammit, try touching a gun with that in your hands. You're a cop. You shouldn't be showing it off to strangers!

Surely there aren't any others. Nothing incriminating here...
"He's a novelty dicemaker," the lieutenant interjects. "And a *police officer* is like him. No wonder the war is so much more costly to the citizens of Revachol."
Noted. You're the worst cop in Revachol.
"I *do*." The lieutenant places the ring on his left temple, the coin on his right.
Thinking of quitting.
Are you sure? You're still alive. Your circulatory system is still working.
How can you talk this guy down to anything?
*Bring it down*. The three metres tall stick insect should be crushed to death. It's not going to happen.
Mutter silently: "Yes, you've been here for three days. The competition is fierce. So many dead."
What was the situation...
You're good to work for now, brother.
He exhales sharply, his face contorted by the immense muscles of the body. "Yes I do, yes I do..."
"Shit, I don't know..." He rubs his hands together. "It's not all that bad."
So when it happened -- you wouldn't want to miss.
"I didn't *want* to do this. I was afraid she was a *conspiracy*. An aerostatic, a *communist* -- an *apostate*."
"These streets, officer," he says, looking down at his feet. "They're part of Revachol West."
Beaten in the neck.
"I don't know man, just try to fuck yourself..."
"What is it made of?"
"Pleasure to hear you say that! That's just your way of saying you're on the go, out of the picture. Don't worry, we got a little-known killer down at the station."
"Are you, though? Because even if you are, we're not going to get into *the past*. It's just you and your joke micro-perception."
He eyes you sceptically. "And what was the Emergencies Act supposed to do with the World Revolution?"
Carried It.
Use a crow's feet to get out of the gates.
By any chance, you'll end up cooped up in the tent, suffocating the fumes from your cigarette and the fumes from the fuel. The room gets almost quiet as this whole conversation winds away...
Something called abuse? That's bad.

"Thanks for your time, ma'am." (Send her away for good.)
"Are you sure you're not stalling?"
"In the Church," she says, straightening her back. "Weall wept -- the church was silent in her silent silence..."
Does your current socio-economic position really make you an in-shape person with all of 'em? Or maybe the Occidenier "Messier" is no such thing. The *Royal Armistice* might just be the thing you've got in your fat hands...

She smiles at you as you take the spinners.
A singer-gym filled to the brim with passion, with abandon. Time to *go*!
"I'm quite sure I don't." She gestures at her travel bag, where a pair of pair of FALN sneakers were caught on film.
Feels like a tractor under the swaying system of a ship's hull, spinning at high speed.
"It was a truly honour-laden decision, but also a decision to act in defence of a friend, an officer of the Commune of Mesque -- I would have been happy for a little self defence. All I care is that it didn't happen."

For the third time, the water pools around you -- sewage runny and foul. Your toes curl into the rainwater as you stand in the barely visible light of March breeck.

"It's a mere shadow of a doubt that this was the *curse that the players are supposed to solve, not the murder. The *curse* that never cures."
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* said so, people say in my head." He spits on the ground.

Are you sure??... I think the corpse looks about eight years old.
"Dora?" she whispers. "The wind has already turned the building into a concrete slab. It has started to do its thing. It's done to get people killed."
"I... am..." (Shake your head.)

You're a detective.

Sure, you've got to get in there. Smoke it in the cabin, make sure it's all good. Then get back to the story.
All I've got to say, though, is that this Lilianovich isn't going to be offended.
"The end of the world."
"It was a kerfuffle, it was nothing." The lieutenant interrupts, brushing a strand of hair off his head.
All I can say is -- it's a great gun. Great for self-defence, self-defence against bad guys. I carry it with me every day."
Don't be too subtle... he doesn't like to be seen *screaming* for help.
Broke its foot
Yeah, you probably do too, so I guess you're either dead or sleeping here too?
"I can't see it." She looks out the window. "It looks like the wind has picked up. The last winter. She's eighty-something. And Pierre. She's eighty. And I am. She looks like she would look goodin' you up, if you wore a wig. Darker, I dare say?"

"Don't ruffle the feathers of Cuno's kingdom with 'em." He takes a swig from his flask. "Cuno's all about rule of operations and stuff."
Confiscate the drugs.
"Apologies, you didn't make me into this little fuck-up that I am. I am a real normal person, and I *don't* like to be tied to an older person. Stop being a cockatoo, Harry."
"I am an expert on sub rosas. Who better than me to police my own person?"
You're being *handled*. This is no time to cry. Let's get you stuff back, goddamnit!

What's what?!
It's a good thing you've got a gun. You should have it. Sure it is, he thinks. We could have done more.
"Don't worry, officer. I've been able to make use of the old radio to send the raw coordinates of the anomaly. They are visible -- to me -- perfectly safe. Go on, find another one."
"I was wrong to congratulate you on that. You were really not. You were too *wondering* to catch on. Go have another look at your machine, officer! It's doing great now."
You'll need to summon the Citizens Militia. Militia forces are contorted by the will of the workers.

It feels like she would have. This feels like the perfect moment for a rape joke.
"I know something. I don't want to hear anything else."
Well, at least they got the name right.
"I'm a drunk..."
The well-worn topic of my life. Now that you mention it...
"I just don't know what's happening..."

"I would never derogaleally misappropriate my employees' work."

"The RCM's..." He pauses. "In Revachol."
The map looks worn. Something cracks as you zoom in: a grid of islands set in a grid ofvolts. Some of them are smaller than others.

"He looks really out of sorts, the way old guys do. Thin glasses, hairy underarms, the sort of thing," he notes. "You could say he's been out of sorts a long time."
Something is different here -- he is, after all, untroubled by line of work and bearing witness to your unimportance. Everything is possible because of you.

Whatever you do, don't throw her away like this.
He douses you with the odd-smelling spray. "That's what they taste like, Tequila. Makes you feel like you're drunker than that gorilla."

"To be honest, we're not sure whether we should give you the key. But -- at least you understand the risks. The public interest against dumping petroleum in there."

You already *are* an asshole.
"I am a natural philosopher, after all."
A:4.5? You've heard the slogan before. Maybe:)
"I am the sole survivor of the expedition. I will not give my life for your sake."
"I don't want your money, bag." He looks at it.
You've seen too much to be that naive. You should stop.
"A *police* uniform?"

"I am not responsible for what people think, my friends say me. I should just use my *unorthodox' technique."

Do you know what makes them so special?
"Art is a bourgeois establishment. It's a last resort," he says with a straight face. "Don't do anything *wrong* and you should protect yourself."
By his very nature he is a moralist. He favours a strict society in which everyone is needed for the very survival for which he was raised. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.

"I don't care -- Alain -- you're just a man in jeans and a juvie hat. Leave it, officer."
*And what did they do?*"
It's a pity we don't get to do more frivolous side-activities immediately. We must now conduct ourselves.
"I have to." He looks you in the eye. "You two are *very* different."
"Fragrant, sure, but not as rare as the *phasque*. But still a species, really. And taxonomic class -- a species subspecies."
Unwittingly the insect stays put. She doesn't like it when her sight is elsewhere. Now, you see, it's trying to feed on other people's cargo -- to her own purposes.

"I have a feeling... your *opinion*? Are you not a leftist paraphernalia company?"
Voyeur rises from the depths? That must be it. You hear something calling for you to step closer...
"I'm sorry for this mess, sir. I promise I'll do it better." He turns to you. "What kind of die are you looking for?"
"Oh, I've been meaning to ask you about the Whirling..."
"La tranquillity! You're getting high on something... I've been tempted for years, but I didn't want it to get out."

"The tale of Man from Hjelmdall is a tale of self-destruction. From the heads of sheep to the mounts. It's *trouble* even for the Man from Hjelmdall, but for me it was not so much *ill* either. My life spiraling out of control..."

"Isn't that what you were saying?"
The entire organdianic grid is on deck after deck of the abandoned ice cream factory, as you pat yourself on your stomach.
Mutter. Who is this?
For a time, the walls and windows did not rattle you. Voil√†! You protected yourself.
All sorts of things might have happened in that moment. Your thoughts are back to the present.
"We should have this."

"I have *40 left*. I've lost all memory of it."
"It's stupid. You're still high."
"A rare case where the obvious -- and still unsolved -- choice -- was correct: nature's brew."
Correctness is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You were in your teens. In your twenties.
"I already threw up. And your room was right here, talking to you!" She's still looking into the basement now, her cigarette still gleaming with cigarette smoke.
Do you know where you can get cigarettes?
The antics of the two cannibals are producing unpredictable results...
*Bratan*, you should pack your bags and go!
The morning light affects the sky, washing the filaments of the stars. It is not an electrical orange -- rather it's a ruddy mess of pale-grey glass. You shudder, see the plates move and then a trill growl.
The feeling of cold passing through your body takes over and you there, in the warm glow of your own eyelids, unsure of what to do with yourself.
"In the end he just wants to create the unsafe kind of scene. To this day, people do when they're sober. And he doesn't like them creating *unsafe* situations."
"I'll walk, mister."
She's trying too hard to tell you the truth -- she clearly doesn't want to hear your concerns.
C'mon... you're turning into some kind of super-detective.
"When Mullen was still alive, his body was going to decompose, so they had to contain it. This makes sense now. It also explains why we haven't seen any  hang-ups from the Nice Guys."
"Well -- now you're telling me what to do."

You know what the Insulindian Lily's is?
"What people?" She looks up, up at you.
Spoken as the blind ice bear. You sense its coldness.
There is a quiet desperation in him. He's SAD.
The bread is crusted, the noodles are coarse, and the seaweed is marbling...
"I just don't wanna get killed. I don't wanna get a fresh wound in my brain -- for some reason. I'd never do anything like that."
"Are you sure?" The wizened man taps his bottle joyously. "That's exactly what he means."
PRESSION! You feel that too! Your fist is in his shoulder like a bolt lodged in brass. He's gonna try it himself, just to see what happens. Show him around, buy him time. IMPITANTS.
Not surprisingly, Ren√© doesn't like it lip-synchrotective.
"It sounds as though you are one of them. In some way, *particular* person -- the one who made the comments above me. In some way, one..." He mumbles, slowly, and appears to stare at something.
"You're not going to solve this." The lieutenant is silent for a second. "We should..."
Just you. Just you.
Just understand: I need a fictional library card from one of these wheel-chair bound neo-disco stars. (Take the card.)
*This* is where the tire screech comes from. You shouldn't drive like a rock.
"It's a valid reason for the closure of the Whirling-in-Rags. It was a *crime*."
"Reasons for leaving -- I was only asking a question."
"Your moral superiority is completely gone. Adorno wasn't even that good at explaining this..."
Damn right I am a La Puta Madre!
"I'm going to the wind."
"Fuel?" The operator turns down the device. "Yes, it's in the trash -- just like any other old device."
How am I supposed to reach for that... pistol?
"I'm sorry it's been such a long time since I last saw you around..."
*Pity! A corpse cut short by his own selfish greed.

"YOUR RACE DYNAMIC HAS BEEN COOLED!"
PLANT CUTTLE IN YOUR CUNNINGS.
Voyager
"Apricot? Apricots are a very special kind of plant. They're violet, almost white, and they're very succulent. Just the sort of thing you'd want in a lady gardener."
*What?* You think, as the light go out and the sounds come from inside the walls.
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's not very good.
You're not going to get to that. You're not gonna make the sandwich.
"Filthy." His eyes turn to savour the sandwich. "Homo histo, what kind of music?"
The old woman sighs. "I haven't talked to her in *three days*."
Have you noticed the baker's lack of interest? This is a sign your case isn't as *as* good as it appears.
You know the story by heart at this point. Your journey must be marked by a continuous drip of pain, no matter where you are. Or who you are.
"I understand," the lieutenant looks around. "It's less about *anodic dance music* than it is about territorial losses."
Thanks, cooler, anatomically correct world, anatomically correct world! We're puny. Lay off if you don't feel like wearing one. FINANCE. This is bullshit.
"He (...) fights darkness!"
Chill out, friend.
Goddamnit... you've been worried too long. You're on the other hand...

You see a young woman smiling at you, in brown hair and skinny glasses. She is waiting for you to speak.
*Dunno, keep it to small talk. It's not that important...]
A shudder, a shiver of fear ishes over you as you look around...
Read about the injuries.
"You were a juvie cop for 15 years. I saw my first glimpses of *real* life when you squashed him in '44. A real killer."
A cold smirk passes her lips. "I don't know, sir. It's cold. And come on, regular citizens are we? We don't use fire to help people, we use it to protect our own!"
"I'm calling it a malfunction, a spelling mistake... a *spell*."
"I know it's hard to understand..." The man looks around. "But okay, it's going to be okay. We all will."
Pulling on the fuel pre-heater gauge.
"What these mean is that he's *out* for life. And the people he's dealing with are also out for death. It's a tragic choice."
"No, no-no... what, there is no company in Martinaise..." The lieutenant doesn't look surprised.
"And while you're there, help me out by clicking the button below -- I'll make sure it's going to go down as many times as possible?"
Bending like a rake, the lieutenant tilts the device further away from your shoulder, continuing the same procedure. The trigger is immediately holstered.
*Please*, Gaston is not responsible for the inconvenience this may cause.
"I am glad to hear, sir." He smiles a little smile. "It's great to see someone getting seriously hurt like that. I have to be at a station, I have to be at a station for three days straight."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- look like you're old? You look like you're on a dead-body-list... don't call me Harrier Du Bois."
In honour of our *grandma*.
*This* is who he is.
"I'm still *totally* okay with this -- getting mauled by an animal just because it looks like me. I'm Katarzine Alasije."
Your dead colleague. He seems to be saying something.
Crack it open first, but only to break it.
Does anything scary happen every now and then?
Time to further investigate the location of the anomaly.
A goodie, a high-class attire, honed over years of combat training. You appear to be a decorated field commander.
Better learn your lesson.
He's a fun guy, will kill you without even laughing.
"I didn't want to say anything."

"Okay, I've said that." She nods. "It sounds like it's part of a larger puzzle -- something that may be called *mysterious*."
"He's a trained actor, knows the box and the microphone -- he can perform a whole new set of moves in mere minutes."
"The most beautiful unit of study in the world." She observes your eyes, studying the colours and the patterns on the surface.
"I am back to basics, okay. The economy."
"In Her Innocence," she says, as you close the folder and the briefcase in your hand. "I saw Her Innocence Dolores Dei -- the kind of woman who's really got nothing to do but drink and smoke."
"Right, and you don't want anyone *to* know? You don't know anything?" The lieutenant raises a brow.
"Dear god, man, I just flinched as the light came on..." His voice echoes all the way down the hallway, fluttering in the low, cold light.
The Great Hornet
"Don't worry, you won't find a single thing. That's the nature of the game. Each turn, you'll bump that number up to #1. I'm not saying that you've been *hanging out* to take a man. No one has."
Not that you've, is it ever your *opinion*?
"No one even know what kind of armour you're wearing."
Where'd she get all this love? From a man who's been through it twice?
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!"
Get out of here. You've got problems. You need to get help.
"Like a... thing?"
"Watch out, he's trying to communicate."
"I've heard of this, yes. I'm a jealous one."

A pregnant woman lets go of her stomach: her face is red like a witch's. She smells of vomit and mayonnaise.
"I am glad to hear that. I am extremely sad to hear that, officer. But you need to get off this talk and do something else, right?"
" a man is dead and away at stake," he declares. The sign bisecting the street agrees.
Telling you all you need to know is that his lovely wife isn't going to wave you off.
She's
"Oh, I didn't want to, I just thought you might know. I'm a funny guy, if you don't mind." He smiles. "If you need any help, just ask."
"A scope of a toy, no?"
"The young woman on the balcony?"
*So you did it without knowing it?* he asks, trying to be as non-fatal as you can.
Babysitting? You're not *alright* if you haven't *properly* put yourself through the toilet.
"I'm not a war criminal, Harry. I'm a police officer and a *superstar* detective."
You need to relay this to her. She's clearly in over her head.
"I'm not a racist. I just don't like dead bodies."
"I can't promise that, officer. But I will say it's been going on for a *long* time. How much do you drink, you ask?"
"I have no time for premium lifestyle questions." He crosses his hands as a quick as his own smile.
"That's why Mullen was so angry when he found the woman dead in the kitchen, wasn't it? And why she was so calm, too -- she was brooding, but... She was also shivering, too..."
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignants' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard the Commune.

Something's different this time. You feel like you should *not* blast random thoughts out of his head. For one moment he's all you have...
"What's the deal?" you hear her mumble under her breath.
Turn. You've been standing here all day -- you should break the door downgate.
Do it? She doesn't even look like she's hurt.

"Pfff... unhygienic. Aqueous en gardes! Welcome to the Gloaming!" She takes a sip of her coffee. "You're welcome, Harry."
"What?" She doesn't know what to say. "No! I can't even imagine what you're talking about, detective. It's Disco! Disco is the sweetest disco!"
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." she says.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." She looks around. "I don't know why I said that."

Time for your bed. It's cold out... but you can't stay here, can you?
The Ecclesiastes have already made up their mind.

"I'm a policeman, Kim. I just need a little latitude to do my job."
"I would never go in there," she interjects. "Just look at the same old stench, the same bad stuff. The place seems to have had a *little band of rebels* fighting for it."
"It's meant in earnest. It's meant to serve as a warning -- to stay away from those greedy spirits who want to brew up this roiling flame."
*"There's something in there... I should know."
"I have -- what's the problem with guns? I don't mean to complain, Miss, but..."
Step 12 -- that's it. You have distilled life into a profitable hobby. You've made it *way* beyond your reach, and yet, with the help of your fellows, you established yourself as a global phenomenon. A phenomenon no one else is ready to happen on.
You need to accept my apology and change your mind, please.
"Always the best method for getting where you are."
"What's going to happen if I don't?"
"I'm sorry, I don't know how to help you, sorry, sorry..."
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The wind is shredding your clothes.
It's a little. You should really give it to the lieutenant. There's a great deal of needless snickering behind his back...
Step *down*.
"Yes, it's your daily dose of *what were you*?" His tone is offended.

You know what? You've got this. The RCM has *all* the tools in the world.
Saintly-Saintly. It's the gentle but vicious strife-torn savagery of the forest savanna. In the distance they rise aeons of weightlifting, carrying little boys with them. Back in the open sea out in the lands beyond the Marloon...

Cuno's in the kitchen. *Pardon me*, officer. I'd rather keep the matter closed, but..." He points to the table where some more coffee.
All I've Lost is Soona's. See, I've Never Heard Of Her. Fucking Lena...
"It's okay, I meant business."
Of course. It doesn't have to be like that. Just a compromise.
"Oughts." She nods. "Well, I guess we're all doing really well together."
*Or* you might die trying. Probably something you've done or are currently on.
"That's right," the lieutenant utters through his teeth.

Brother, you're so good at co-working, you could've easily gotten the *co-workers* and then used that to your advantage. You're a cop!

Bystanders report no combat injuries -- cut, bruises, nothing like the dead skull of The Law. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too.
"How am I going to meet?" The first thing he notices, however, is the sweat on your brow. Dust his clothes and then just nosedive.
"I am drawn to the historic opportunity to start a rock and roll club in the 45th Precinct."
"What is there to talk about in this place?"
"Remarkable! That was *exactly* what we needed. A real pleasure to meet you again, officer!"
For the sake of the investigation, please do take the stolen cigarettes and smoke them.
For the third time, the pain stretches deeper than your knee... 80-year old drain pipe? Hard to say. Seaweed seeps into his pants...
Your fingertips touch your forehead. Darkness. And the name on the doorbell too. Ma√±ana. Revachol.

Raindrops fall on water. It feels like a small droplet smiling its way out of existence, to the left and right...
"Only *after* they have killed him."
"You're not a real police officer."
"Araq..." (The helmet nods.) "Corruption."
* *Cuno*, you know what you did?* He takes out his pen and renders you a penitent confession.
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at you intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno..."
You're not giving a shit. You're just giving it a try.
"Did you just see the *swinging pigs*?"
"Where can you get your hands on that?"
Not sure, it's just the tinny joy of multitasking again.
"Hey, give me a rest."
"Cuno's gonna hang you, Cuno."
"What are you doing? Don't shoot him, it's all a stupid idea."
"I don't know how I feel about the union..."
How am I going to pry it open?
What is that... Is this why no one's been here in ages?
*What do you think? De-accost? De-detect? It doesn't look like he does.

With aplomb the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, from the rains and the sleet and the sleet again. But you can't *free* them, can you?
No. Sure you can. Look at that. What is this? Oh no, no...
"T-the way it is, I can't help but notice strange things when I'm not looking."
"Are you a spiritual man?"
*Here* you go: "Hey, Tequila, what did you want to talk about?"
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. The air feels a little stale...
"I have something we could learn from you too. Ellis Kortenaer. Ellis was a regular stowaway -- until he started acting strangely. He was screaming, he *was* distressed. And now his problems are more serious than we realized."
She smiles and your eyebrows arch. She's been listening, but not when you asked her about her husband.
He did, sir -- he's a winner.
"May I suggest?" your tongue is trying to move around again...
"Odd..." The lieutenant squints his eyes, then you.
Mutter silently: "Yes, you've been here for three days. This is what life is all about."

"A pleasure to hear that it's okay." She seems to enjoy the word.
May the Mother love be with you.
"I'm sorry to say," she looks you up and down, "there's no way you'd catch me using my workweeks cheat. That's for sure."

This is *your* plan all right.
"Fuel -- run. Water -- battery -- let me know when it's done."
So this is how it's going to go: bad for your health, the perception of a leader of men has been... basically wrecked.
"Me and your pals have a long and spindly walk to the canal." She looks to the sea.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Commence task.)

There is a swift, satisfying click... your hands are covered in blood.
On the third day the working class is crushed under the magnitude-3.6 earthquake that shook the world. Solid democracy failed. Silences, no more. The end is near.

That's what he's for, huh. Don't gloat.

Thank you for your candour, sire. She seems to me to be a real woman-friendly *Woman-Friend*... Go ahead, ask me some questions!
Won't so easily turn into this.
"It's not *whether* I am. I am quite the hobo."
"That's a good one, officer." He smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to get shot in the mouth -- and don't become a victim yourself."
Do you know? You're not feeling it. There is no infusion of *any* liquid ingredients into this world. You're cold now. Steam and metal has dissolved inside your circulatory system. Everything is frozen.

His eyes narrow. "Yeah. Well."
"Titus, you have good ideas. We should move on." He takes the tape to his lapel.
"I'm a rational guy, Eugene!"
"I would never hazard a guess like that. The fuck were you doing up there -- with those snickers? You were alone, fucking in that tent... and now we..."
*Orbital*, lieutenant. It's obvious you meant for this case.
Why are you even still reading this? Don't you want to be the crab man?
"I would do something like that. I would knock you out cold then. It would be so cool, wouldn't it, but I would always have you up there... Do you want to be a super cool cop or not?"
"I can't. It's not an option. I'm out of bullets."

You already looked like a phoenix on that fat rectangle. White everywhere. Your fat, pathetic belly is just white everywhere.
You're in plainclothes. Street clothes. You should try and show you're a cop too.
You have the urge. But willpower isn't always forthcoming. And it's not easy to take on like this.

Enough with you filling out forms, arresting people and telling lies. It's protectionism.
Breathing? You rub your face, the water drips down your cheeks and your fingers stick to your ears.
"Motherfucker..."
"The Hardies don't give a shit." He looks around. "We're on it." He looks around the room. "It seems like they're *out* on this."
Your body is too powerful. It's not *too* unnatural for you.
"I'm not awake for these talks, sweetie. We need to get this investigation started now."
It's anything but a blank stare. He's warm, no longer than usual, his body still warm under the blankets. You don't hear the words, but you feel the photons pierce their ice.
"The nations that colonized the pale."
"There's a god damn monument in there. You should ask that."
Tell her this isn't about her or them -- it's about *justice*! Tell her it's for real!
"I'm a rebel, I live a noble life."
what if I'm thinking of going home?
People like that don't getute people, people who are born leaders. They're a breed -- what they want doesn't matter.
Glad to have been of service to the suzerain! This is good news.
This place is: "Bench C, 2-3"
"A teenage woman, what could she be up to now?"
"Whooh, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good day. Maybe it's just the wind?"
Welcome to the free world, brother. Grab a bottle of liquor, shake it around and then head back to the coast.
"What do you need in return? You'll get me work, believe me!" (Get the promise of a book.)
"It was a question then. Where were we, where were we? You wanted to know something?"
Turn off the radio.
"Fucking *entothienneer*, you dink. Theo got that finger thing, he's gonna finger you again. This is what the kid thinks I'm doing."
"I would never kill for a living. I'm ashamed to even be a cop. Look at those freckled girls I saw on the cover. The freckled ones, the witch hunters! Look at their faces, Cuno!"
"How am I going to make it... could you do it like that?" She sounds worried.
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, while you shift around and look for the trash.
You've got to protect her.
"I'm more than happy to tell you all about it. I think I got *sad* when it was really digging this shit."
"Okay. Sure. Until then, I'm gonna go ahead and ignore your objections."
Do you know? Because she's a *bad* mother. Unpaid child labour...
Time for your own tricks. The lights are fooling you.
"People thought she was dead for a while..." He thinks. "She's doing just fine, though. She's not a known killer. Killer instinct probably."
"Cuno's in the reeds, piggo!"
The woman's expression is timid andaverteous, her eyelids narrow and her pupils ruddy. But you can feel their overwhelming connection -- to the place...
"She's the one." The lieutenant takes a step closer, his eyes shining. "Remember, we have to get her back before we can interview her."
*What's Wirr√¢l Untethered?*" is the end of it.
*"There's something in there, isn't there? Something in the shape of a man's shoe. Or a woman's shoe. Like a *man's* shoe. Or a woman's shoe."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. Your fingers are *immediately* coloured with red, for some reason the lieutenant doesn't understand.
Not that you've, is that why we're in this mess we're in?
Bag your brains. Your fingers to the skull copier. You have good, normal results -- yes, *you* should get rid of the personal log as soon as possible.
"I am a revolutionary servant of humanity, Lord..." he says in a seru-natural way.
Why am I interested in this so-called... game?
A trashed motorway, mangled by war. A thousand years ago. You must have walked the coast 28.) by a monument of war-paint on the side of a building. The ruins look ancient.
Finally Idiot can play the game they're all made for.
"Yes." There's a pause. "RCM vehicles have headlights tuned especially to reveal halogen watermarks."
"I am. *I* am a secret service agent. I do *not* want to think like that."
"Received..." You hear the sentences come to life again.
ants, huh. That's what the multitool saw. You don't see yourself any more.
A stupid idea.
A hurt little smile. "That's because you're queer. And you're gonna get heart attack too -- in your head. And then

Just like how she's been hiding here for ages.
"A seafort? That's an interesting name. I like it."
But, Harry... They're not just ordinary clothes. These are the perfect pair of super-cool sunglasses for street artists, artist types, and street people!
"In that case, I have a bag of pure magenta cocaine upstairs."
A curious thought occurs in your mind's eye...
Green: you've got it! This para-glycoprotein; left: epidermolylate from the wrapper; blue: a para-glycoprotein; this para-glycoprotein is left in the lining, just barely petal-shaped.
"Cuno, I know this *chimney* is far too esoteric for you to understand, but..." The lieutenant whispers to himself. "You probably shouldn't have done it."
*Cindy the SKULL*!
Where *are* you?
By now... you should be thinking about how the writing on your legal document is not only bad but also illegal. Could you not just walk into a *lawman's* trap?
And help him protect the coast from the predatory sea fish!
"I'm sorry I said that. I'm sorry I lost my memory, and I'm sorry."
Just ignore him, I don't need to do this to you. He's mean. Don't even tell me anything!
"Pardon. I was just trying to make an observation."
But what? I can't even *remember*.
No, you don't. You know what? This isn't it.
I *want* to go there.
"I'm Samaran."
"Mm, uhh... never mind."
"When I was a teen?"
"Yes, I can see the footprints."
"Dad -- Cuno doesn't give a fuck about bugs."
"No, I was just trying to be nice..."
The Iilmaraan people do not give a shit about *any* races. They're not even human.
Are you sure??? Every time you do?
"I'm a drunk, stupid, I-know-what-wanted-to-be like you. Me. Second-rate garbage. I'm not even going to get into the stupid, stupid, and *not* the garbage -- you should outnumber them."
"I'm a law-abiding citizen and I want to be a really good one."
Railing -- a.k.a. the Bay of Revachol -- is a massive system of urban sprawl bordered by harbingeru by the bay to the south by the harbour. Apart from the main artery in Martinaise, the streets here are mostly commercial.
OREGONAUTS!
Are you sure?... Your working fever is almost gone. It's glowing.
It's not accident. It's bad faith. He needs to go.
*Bratan, what's going on?* She tries to calm herself.
"A very important advancement over the competition, officer."
"Like money, brother."
A yes? You're sure you've spent enough time on the water lock to get an idea.
You leap back, to see that the lock hasn't been released -- the young woman is in the corner of her room, clutching her stuffed toy. Her eyes are wide and she is impassive.
The reeds sound like they're whispering, like they're in a very public place.
"What can I... fuck it out of?!" He staggers forward.
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, sir."
"I can't see. I'm just an old woman who's been practising karate."
"I am an insane man. I must be surrounded by the ghosts of my past."
The Cyan Mouth Man appears behind him. He's holding a piece of twiddling wire -- a smile.
"I'm a policeman!"
" Great to meet you! I'm Joyce 'Lip 'Re' Sylvie." She flashes a smile at you. "Loyal assistant. "
"The snow is melting."
No. Politics is about self-determination, pluralism, and control. It's about those principles embodied in statecraft and parliamentary power.
"I have no time..."
"What's the deal breakin' with this Franconigerian cavalryman?"
no sweetie referring to herself romantically?
Bag the boot and drag it to the motor carriage. (Put the skull in it.)
Please? You're the law. Police brutality!
"I've got to agree to that. You're one regular cop."
It's not even a question. He could have it. He could even be critical.
*Forget* it. It's too much work for you to solve.
"Whoahaha? I knew you were a commie king-detective."
Don't be a wild one, it's more than that. This is a manly case, he trusts you. Hard up your side and *go* for the kill.
"First, she was an *aisle*, not a *selecra* or a *sine*. She was white to begin with. Fifi was just a guess, see what she's got for now."
"She's the one you've never seen before."
There used to be a fur carpet at the back of the church where once a king had placed his knights. They were only kept for tying up loose ends.
"No, no-no." He looks startled.
"I'm afraid we'll never know what happened here."
"Love. We're just... standing here."
*Then* you will make your cup of tea. A magic cup. A very, very real chance.
My partner, in Klaasje's words: "We had no idea each other."
How do you explain this trash container?
"Disco? You were high!" He snorts. "Disco on steroids."
"I am conducting this investigation in search of La Puta Madre."
But so what! A peep of smoke across the broad daylight! Now we know that Morell doesn't like it here in the tent, so we have to find another way.
It's a snap to his fingers.
*Your* wrong turn. It's okay now -- he's nodding slowly, but steadily.
Waves wash off the rage in you and instead start pulsing, pulsating like pearls in the air. A flock of seabirds is searching for you.
"Oh?" the young man replies sharply. "I
Give up. Stop reading this. You're too sorry to say it.
The blow to the core probably lingers over the strike, but what the workers did wasn't very productive.
You're not. The point is to explain away the whole *
"The officers, I am sorry to inform you, have unpaid fines due tomorrow. I would have preferred not to have been your partner. I understand the financial relief, but I also understand the loss of a friend is *much* greater than any financial gain the Sola guy made you make."
"I'm afraid they don't." The lieutenant adjusts his hat. "I've got this whole mess wrapped up in paperwork."
"I don't know what, I don't know what, you're doing. But you should know that I have no doubt in my heart about the justice system working."
"I *did*, I didn't get it..." He sighs, looking down at his legs. They have run out of steam.
The rifle falls to the ground with a huge thud.
"What's he doing out here in the reeds? Sounds like drug dealing maybe..."
But let the thought go on.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have beaten. But do it! Ride the lightning. Ride the lightning does *not* like this.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to do things differently. The public has already heard of you."
"He's a quiet man, mostly communicates through his breathing. Willingly so."
"Anyway, I've changed my mind."
"FUCKUP UP, CUNO!"
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something..." The lieutenant glances at you.
"hey..." Cuno squints at you.
* Silent too, his voice suddenly very quiet. *He's* trembling...
abstract movement in the brain. That's what...
Does any of that make you a better detective?
Seven-hundred-and-twenty-five. The pale. The time has come to go home. A little younger, ten to twelve years younger. Make up for it, buddy.
"Is that why you haven't contacted the Moralintern yet?"
Surprisingly, the mane was not thought of as an inspiration to young Lickra(ÔøΩ)*. He was overwhelmingly right wing, and certainly not a homo.
"TEMPORARILY CALLING FOR OFFICERS."
"I'm a recording artist, you see. I like to piss myself."
PRESSION! You got your eye on that kid. Smart alecky ass. Make that call to your team when you call for me! YAWK, yew kiddy!
"I'm a police man. I don't need answers."
Banaital is the capital city of Revachol.AAW, and the de facto capital of the Union. And that's just the way it is.
"I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm sorry I said you didn't have anything." She smiles gently. "I'll be here later-hour."
"I think it's best you tell me what you found."
Never mind. Just give it all up, buddy.
"I am developing a special software to manage and preserve the Doomed Commercial Area."
Time to get it all together.
Guess... some sort of an underwater megacorporation maybe? A place to be found.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NEXT SECOND?
She's too high. She's about to cry.
"Don't worry.
*1UP*. This calls for a rank, a category, and a...
"It's okay," he takes out his notebook. "It was her. I know this must sound strange to you but I couldn't just leave her like this."
"PIGS CALL YOURSELF A *SANDWICH*!"
Poor.
"How will the streets work, Gaston?"
" "I'm not a *binoclard*. I'm a cop."
What is that...?
The Horsehead
"Yes. Or one of those *maybes*." He pauses, looking to the sky. Then his eyes light up. "Either way, I'm not planning on coming back to this for you."
"The historic opportunity is here!" He looks at the coast, the rain. "You must join us in destroying it."
"What's in your lorry,
"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded, but I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #3."
The phone. The machine is ringing.
The Doorgunner Megamix is a mega machine gun that, if left unaddressed, can unleash unimaginable amounts of damage in a matter of seconds.
"Acele, you're an *ill omen*. What you *can* do is connect the dots."
About another thing...
am he trying to say something, sire?
"Fuck, That's not *my* problem. It's a real *problem*."
"I'm a possible witness."
Wirr√¢l
"I haven't been drinking that much, I hope so."
"At first I was really scared it would go down, but it didn't. The captain has a way of withdrawing -- and even deepening the life of the man."
"I do," she nods. "And that's just the way they are *used* in Revachol. With everyday objects, ordinary bullets..."
"Watch yourself." Cuno's ears narrow. His fingers run over the buttons of his ring. The ivory rims rattle.
"Friendly? I like helpful people. I like helping people. If you need support, I can get it from signing autographs, I'm on it for *15*."
"I am a true champion of the working man."
I don't believe this is true.
"The two-eyed lamb." (Point at the corpse.)
It was the year you lost your memory.
You already saw the helmet would be pretty rad.
It's merely a coping mechanism. We should stop pursuing "real progress" -- it's childish. Stop attempting to control the reed-creature.
I can barely *read* it.
She's not scared of them.
"Oh." He doesn't reply. Just his voice, in extreme late hour wear.
"Me and this punk loser are gonna get drunk, I hear. Right now."
"I am the voice of reason. I will address the strike."
no need to underestimate the gravity of this.
"Fucking *welkins* are all you have!"
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard over and protect the Commune.
Eh, it's cool, man. It has to be a cool jacket to get what the. name of the. effect will have.
You did it! You saved the day of history when you thought I'd crush on a cornered animal.
Err... your alcoholism maybe? Hard to say. Definitely.
"The Stormers would have done a fine on the Samaran isola."
"They already had a warehouse in Martinaise -- and they sent someone from EPIS. They're good at what they do."
What's wrong with this book?
Deny you're not a doctor.
"Invisious? You mean like when you're out here scouting out places for homeless people? Like a bunch of clowns."
Thank you... Maybe you don't remember what it's for.
You're a cop?
"Your Honour," the lieutenant steps in. "This is a common theme. The weak are more susceptible to their creator, while the strong -- in a *womb* sense -- are even more susceptible."
"I was a track star cop, and I need it for... *sprints*, not cockatoos."
"Who does the weights?"
"Are you enjoying the sight of these *gardening utopia* plants? You must be really into those...  Yacht-Motor Motors."
Never mind. Just give up on them.
"Ah, the *war veteran*!"
Intervigal Bloc: No Yes 1, 2, 3, 4.
Sure. But that only comes in handy to finish the book. Go to sleep, behold...
You can't lie, buddy. He totally exaggerated.
"So, you're not going to buy the crab man a sandwich?"
The Door ToYourWorkshop
It *does* have.
"It's a bit risky. You need to be *very* sharp, smart as a tack, and *extremely* presentable. And *you* don't want to lose your cool."
Its pretty. She knew he was a man of the left, what with everything -- always trying to make things right. Sadly, she assumed leadership of the Wild Pines Group.
"Is it... the *communards* or the Union? I can't think of any. You know, I've been to both."
"I'm sorry. I'm just here to do my job, Gaston. I don't know anything about anything."
All of them? Joyce could bring all of this together *finitely*. Before she's a drop below the fold...

Working Class: your skin colour, sex, how old
What is it, he's just *warm* right now. Try putting your hand in his mouth, you can feel it pump through your hand.
*Not* good. This is something to keep in mind for a few hours. Then go on and beat the shit out of this corpse.
Maybe! But you don't have a *keyboard*! Maybe you could use those!
The aim is to save lives. Save lives. Save the world. Save the road. Save the world.
Now the only thing left to do is to door the East Delta Commerce Centre.
"In what way, should you believe me? Should we stop talking before we get going?"
You see sympathy in the young woman's eyes.
All-
"What kind of? What were they doing before they started killing each other?"
"Welcome to the Doomed Commercial Area." The lieutenant looks you in the eye. "You are here to face the law!"
"I am conducting research into the most *common* cryptid -- *elefanteneutics*. I want to know about it."

Now. Go arrest that maniac.
"Yes, and *that's* the Revacholian warrior regiments."
Patrol Officer Yeezy frowns at you, waiting for you to step in.
It was a different world.

"It seems I'm a pretty good negotiator."
Green: Politics. International law, confusing and vague. Tens if not hundreds of pages of paperwork, diplomatic cables, and autopsy reports.
The clipovers reverse the order of the act. The cleaning lady removes the bottom cover, revealing a rusted cover with a row of pen marks all over -- and a keyhole missing in the cover.
Not this will make things any better at her husband. He has bad habits.

"hey." He looks you up and down. "*Weird* of me? Okay, I get it. Sort of. But you know what?" He shakes his head. "You shouldn't expect anything less from me."
"Gym teacher?" The look on your face catches on. You've spent too long at the gym putting up with *unorthodox* notions -- now you understand just fine.
" a giant insect. It would have been interesting to look at, to see what's under its *head*."
She's still admiring the fixed, painted, gold-rimmed cargo, her motor carriage.
Mr. White's *secret*? That will be his lot. Laugh all you want but you'll get bored eventually.
Even if I can't remember, how many other places has this nonsense bothered you?
The Head?
Not that he is.
A set of rather large medals on his chest perhaps? Or maybe a physics demonstration? Probably.
Lieutenant? You've got it bad -- you know how it *works*. This connection proves that you're not the cool cop who fucks Martinaise up, or the hornet in the room.
"I'm a police man, you see."
Because I can't be a 'Rehm Prefect' or a 'Mintel' -- because they're boring. Sad.
"...*(sic) told us to fuck off and move underground. A secret passage hidden in the muck." He points underground. "Cafeteria floor, sleeping bag, another cop..."
"The Sun? You're in the grip of a gloomy year. You won't get along just fine."
"Hmgh... what happened to the time machine?"
A threat?
There, I said *there* is a *good* place to start.
Just ask him about it, try to find something of interest. Just him. Do the honours yourself thingy.
"Shame? I'm not happy to be gone. Happy to tell you something new."
"I don't care -- he's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"I'll see what I want, the guy behind the kiosk." [Leave.]
"Wow, you don't want to finish your sentence on top of that. You don't want to finish this yourself."
"Do you think the strike is somehow connected to the murder investigation?"
Babysitting? You're not. There's nothing you can do about it. It's frozen, dark and cold. Cold and clammy in there.
Savour. Forever. Forever Stupid. Ever. They *will*.
This is a wise plan -- for a later point. Okay, so this didn't turn out well for you... but who cares? Work is work.
"Eh, for god's sake, quit drinking so hard! You taste like a pig, Cuno!"
Medicinal waste products. This is *serious*. [Leave.]
"I am very well known in certain parts of Martinaise. A prominent figure. There are those who would call me a *pussy-boy* myself."
"Be friendly."

"I don't know what I'm even trying to say here..." His trembling hands tremble.
"It was a real pleasure. You know, I wasn't sure whether I should tell you the truth or not." She smiles. "Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you, Harry."
"I am sorry I lost my sidearm, officer."
nuting it.
"So... uhm... the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" She looks half-bored for a moment, or you'll get another beer.
Holding the piece has taught her something. It's a noble and necessary skill.
Now that you mention it, I disagree.
PRESSION! You got your mouth full of surprises! You'll probably get Pyrholidon too, but right now you *can't* stand him.
"DON'T tell her about the murder, okay? It was a kid. Maybe she'll tell *her* about the gun sooner or later."
You already threw the staple out there. Radish.
"I'm going to look for drugs in apartment #2. They sell out."
Honestly, you could make a case for yourself, with some hall strategy. You could even argue for being superior to their competition...
Won't? Your tribe are *very* green.
"What do you mean the Cuno is a *murderer*?"
A word on the side the lieutenant is a forewoman. She's not 100% sure it's her husband, but she would've kept it.
"It's a pity. The world could use a good, hard-asin' good repair guy like this."

"A book store?"
*But*! It's not about the clothes, it's *about* the jacket. You should know by now.
"Oh...." his eyes, still narrow, suddenly bulge to attention. "You got duped there. People got duped like that."
"The old man in the wheeler... it just doesn't make sense to me at this moment."
*Bratan*, you've worn out the armour. Your body has turned against me
There are no objections. This is good. Let's get on with the story.
"Is that what you're doing with that gun in your hand?" The lieutenant points at you, in the holster.
"It's okay. I'm sure it'll be easier to track down the shooter. Now..."
Ex-wife? That's what she's for, isn't it? Keep her talking, she won't leave the lorry if she doesn't...
"I am 100% sure this didn't make him understand. He isn't."
In honour of your health, officer!
*Diamorphine* is probably not gonna make you feel better.
Darkness is in the air.
This is it. This machine is making communist utopias. Get up, goddamn this *crab-shit*! This is why our race has needed so much communist utopias...

"I did, you see? I saw it on the news. The RCM was shot down. We got the body down from the tree -- on the island. We found the perpetrator, that's all. That's all."
It's not.

"Me and my partner are so close." She looks at you and nods. "We should, like, get going. For now, we really need to keep an eye out for one another."
Another cardboard die. Looks like this block might come with future versions.
Disorienting him is a bit like waking into a real world situation. Try as you might, it doesn't work.
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people. Can't help but wonder if she really smoked you in the first place...

Get and their console.
Alone, you have been running around for days in this dark place, admiring pieces of the same puzzle you've solved.
"We didn't hear the jump, officer. Just a radio-powered docked microphone blasting off the church roof."
" A dark sarcophagus below the nave. One of the gauntlets has an untimely passing resemblance to a *vacation vehicle*.
"Besides..." He looks at the phone again.
YES. It was beautiful. Beautiful enough to bring back. You will remember it for your kids.
"I'm sorry, officer," he turns back to you. "You seemed like such a good cop to me."
"As I was saying..." He blinks his black eyes, pretending to be deaf. His pupils remain pupils. "Fuck it..."

" "A *bratan*, you picked the wrong hostel. Now go mail the city gates, but hurry on -- this place is run by D√©bardeurs."
"No. It's not like that." His tone is silent. "She'd have seen you from her room -- and remembered."
what? What was he through?
"I am back. Who are you? Halting." He points to the sea. "You're getting a headache, are you not?"
Now the only thing left to do is to call it a day.
What is happening?
Clyde walks the dog first, then the colleague, then the husband. They disappear, then rise again.
Awful ballistics. The binoclard would have been a nightmare to catch. All you could see was horror as his forearms were folded into a ball, blood dripping down his cheeks...
Bah! Yes. This book was really good. You really got to know this local kid, you know, and you're going to be super-cop now.
"Hm... I don't know, I don't know what happened."
It *wasn't* fatal.
"Don't worry, Lena, he's just a worker who got trashed. His stuff is all his own."
"Hey, don't belittle me. I'm still a Tequila Sunset."
An ideologue of war and slaughter -- what else could he be doing now, he thinks, before Titus steps in? Titus looks unsurprised.
"You were wearing something called the 'Headless FALN Rider' model."
"I'm Prettyhelms."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. You should log onto my service history and begin looking for hidden caches of stolen goods."
Maybe the missing locusts were entombed there, in the traps planted by Evrart's deceit.
You sense a little hesitation there -- or maybe even fear? Maybe he didn't want to be seen with the *boys*. Maybe he was trying to impress *her*?
*Tioumoutiri, the woman speaks in Kineema.* An *ambush* happens when men desecrate or wipe their own dirt clean and responsibility.
"Like grandma always does."
PRESS ENGAGEMENT.
I'm talking to you. You think you're cooler than everyone else, but you are! You're The Law. You can't be anyone else!
"I haven't seen him for, so go listen to me. I just need you to address that girl. He doesn't care..." His voice trails off.
"You know, like you've been saying for several months now." The lieutenant looks at you with a wary glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era*. It's the *end* of the world."
You can? You
He is completely out of it for this. This was a real bad idea.
"What am I missing?" She takes out her packing materials. "Where can I store these?"
See, it's THE POLICE POLICE!
Holding the gun feels natural and satisfying. It's like a ritual, but better!
Fire away!
Somewhere, somewhere.
"I would never kill for a living. I'm ashamed to even be a cop. Look at these freckled girls I saw on the cover. The freckled ones, the witch hunters! Look at their faces, Cuno!"
Get the *what* now? Why did it fail?
Your fingers reflexively reach for the holster of the pistol -- but there's a slippery texture to it. You jerk the handle open, but nothing happens.
"I *don't* want to see me go through this. Or your little *psychic* little ritual. Let me ask you something else."
*Your* thoughts.
You're not going to win.
And thank you, it truly was worth it.
Joyce? This taps into something in your neocortex. A series of clicks, like a violin on a string. Click...
He stares out of the window.
Seventy-thirties.  You can't say you're not surprised.
A bright smile. She's not a girl you'd want to pry from, not in a good way.
"I'm sorry. No amphetamine trouble is expected."
"What is that -- your cabin?"
With your boot in your hand, you aim and aim at the ghostly *enemy* building. The living things, the glass, you... You're going to hurt your head.
"He's glad to take the burden off his shoulders, the head of state."
The Lickra(TM) rider. You can barely stand and move. Even your hands move...
"La Revachol is the greatest. It's a500 years ahead of the *Big Three* in human history..."
The wind picks up again and then it's gone. No response.
N/A. Politics aside, how did this broke the water lock?
Yes. [Finish thought.]
"There's a lot of that. But I'm afraid I'm going to concentrate on one thing -- the *fasces*. The fasces are in the back of the fridge. We should move it to the back of the fridge."
"It's a grand. Grand Unified uses 4-lateral recess. That's it. Multi-storey buildings shooting up to 60 km/h. Low clearance, high rise."
"I really should get this. I could use some *danger* waves once we get out here in the bay."
*This* is Burke.
I've done this job for long enough for me to have an opinion.
"Hey, about that church..."
Time for a walk. In the vast emptiness, beyond that, you can barely make out the shapes of the branches, on the perforation lines in the mud: the initiated collision. And then it was over...
"Believe me, it's bad for business. It makes us into *shit*."
*"There's something we're missing."
Are you a... racist?
"Thanks Cuno, that was useful."
"For what time period?"
Not so... this is done. Here it comes...
I can't. I have no idea why I was such an idiot for so long.
"We should do something of substance here. The investigation has not yet taken place." He looks at you. "We need to interview Evrart Claire, or we'll lose the investigation."
"I'm a policeman myself, that's the best part."
"So...
All I've Got Is A Beretta 89mm. I'm gonna try *not* to have more things.
"It's not *whether* I am."
Dodged the bullet. Blam!
* So, you were in a relationship?
"I'm a real deal and this is my signature. It's a mural I did myself."
What's this, a joke here or did Cuno just *shrug* all the shit he's doing for the time being?
Better watch your stepmother up.
"It's not *whether* I am. I am very measure of it. My decision-maker class to blame is my husband. I'm sorry for wasting your time."
"I am a *sexual* desperado. Look at me."
You're not.
"Are you doing this?" The lieutenant steps in. "Or you were using?"
The gardener tilted her head vigorously. "What is this, a joke? What does a gardener need this stupid shitshow for?"
Spying... By loitering and manipulating the elected officials we are supposed to serve? This seems odd...
"What happened?" your partner starts, as he continues to stare at his logs.
"A god damn right corner, Kim!"
"It's a matter of life and death for ordinary workingmen. Not so much for the suzerain, but for mankind as for mankind..."
"Anytime. You should ask him for a ride."
"I'll see what I want, cop. Talk to him." [Leave.]
What's *your* medical history?
Please do not.
Martinaise is the smallest city in Revachol, in the middle of the Insulindian isola. Martinaise is almost impossibly small for an independent state. Its administrative structure is a district ten times the size of this place -- Jamrock.
Damn... that's odd.
"I found out that you're a *liberast* through your mother's work and your mother's mother..."
"Oughts?" She picks a little capsule from her breast pocket and shakes it.
Made of a solid gold, with a very faint magenta soul to it. A great white soul was there, trapped between the insides of the Solas. This was the last of the four signs of failure.
All I want is a drink. (Accept the task.)
"The cleaning, I'm sorry, I'm not getting it..." He sighs.
Kisses from adjoining skins...
A knock on the door reveals a stack of clothes. Motions, sweat stains, and a pair of pants.
Barry, watch out!
He turns his eyes to the distance, swivelling his eyes to get a better sense of it. "Yes," he murmurs.
This is it! The truth! GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
A yellow book is your *gun*. Better not hand it over, better not mess it up.
C'monze yo, baby, you're the most important one.
"Keep it down, Harry." He unflops the pilsner. "You can't win with *me*."
Dozens of pages of stained glass windows stand in the yard of the oldscast -- all the women and children are there to see his work, looking at it.
"You're a fugitive. We need toa got that folder already." He crosses his arms. "Now, what can we do for you?"
Officer Du Bois, you already have a great deal of trust in this kid. If you don't improve your driving record, he might not be able to catch that drug stuff...
Raining... you feel like you should go to the roof, ask the tree there if he's there -- it would calm the mind.
" Great to meet you! I'm Joyce 'Lip'Re' Sylvie. Have a moment of the evening, officer!" She flickers with affection, then embarrassment.
"I'm surprised, too, because I don't really know how it got up here. The roof shake, the water lock crackles all around. I should probably get an air gun... oh, wait, absolutely. Let's move!"
Kim, you're turning me into an invalid!
"I am considered the finest in Revachol. My grandfather was a court detective in the Revolution."
Who does?
"That's what the Union is for... Union matters. The working class."
"*May*?" He shrugs.
Something's off. You could *internalize* your win. This is happening. Everyone stands tall and proud in the pride of being able to claim victory over the world.
He flicks a switch. The engine turns on with a whir. A deck of new yorker sails above Commodore Whittaker on a narrow pier. A nineteen-pacer, with a straight face and a mass of pinewood ruffles.
*Bratan*, I am so sorry. I would never do anything like this to you. Please let's go.
Your dark brown hair is combed back, dyed blonde, and braided into a single hairline hair style. It's freckled from head to toe with light brown, hair-red, and studded with a complex network of dark grey strands.
What is it? Your body is not capable of more than a few basic tasks for an individual under stress.
"How am I going to pawn that pawnbroker's stuff?"
"Recklessness."
Does the man care about his *sports*? Or is he a sports drinker?
"Please don't cry..."
"My god, no!"
"Yeah, yeah." He nods. "Some people get shot by accident. *Some* get shot by a corpse. You guys have been here long enough."
To everyone! To the cops, the cheaters
"Pleasure to meet you, officer. This is very special, for the police." He turns to you.
"hey." The old lady lets out a loud screech as you shove your heels into her warm-blue raincoat.
"Wow. That's pretty clever."
What he's saying is -- you're not gonna like this if you do manage to turn him off for a while...
"You were there? You weren't shot?"
"Oh, I didn't. It's not like I'm under stress here. I like being useful, not judging by what I see. I don't have to take orders from people."
"Okay. Shut up and wait for my Mother"
"Like an ant, right?"
Feels good. This used to be something they shared. (To yourself.)
"No, no-no, fuck off, I'm serious! Don't listen to this f****t! You're a grown man -- fuck off."
*Supreme fuck?*" He turns to the lieutenant. "He's a cool guy. Doesn't need this *demonstration*."
*Grab your sandwich* squeezes the air with his hand, but you're not moving. You hear a loud, warm pop, your head jerking and your eyes glazed over as the man throws a handful of crack in front of you.
This doesn't seem like a good place for a washbasin.
"The RCM's..." He thinks. "In Revachol."
"That's a classic, I forget the exact number." Her eyes return to you.
"Anything to help us get through this," he responds with a hand gesture, but keeps his eyes from rolling back to the recording device.
Order the body downstairs.
"I'm afraid..." The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "You've said you're afraid."
This is a touchy-feely one. You should probably talk to Evrart.
What happened to you?
Knows what a basement is.
Write:.) You should ask her about the dead man.
abso-natural is it?
"I do -- I do."
And my god he's not sleeping!
All of it.
Distancing it from your eyes. With its scythe-like head and its sharp blade in his face.
"At the disco where we stayed, she yelled 'I am a racist, I'm a bartender'. I told her, I didn't want to get caught up in it."
"I would never agree to anything."
What about the Seolite spy?
The Presence speaks with the speaker device in your hand, whispering: "Welcome to Revachol!"
Tell me something odd.
Mellow. Mellowhead like a whorl of steel.
"I'm sorry Kim, I can't do that anymore." (Raise your voice.) "I don't wanna talk about this shit."
"I'm sorry to have singled you out, officer, but I have a confession I want everyone to share."
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You don't have any more questions. No more jokes. No more horrors.
"I got the feeling that you'll change your mind if you see my badge. Are you a change of plans, lawman?"
Doesn't look like you would have a problem with church style.
Stomach truthfully.
Don't be fooled, lieutenant. The trickster is deep inside the piggo's heart. He knows the animal will sympathize with Revacholian interests if it's not tied to any one branch of government.
Reeds, rivulets, reeds?
Harry really cares about that *bullet* thing, he's a good man, has good intentions.
* Immensely. Your thoughts contract -- through the sheer weight of the chair and the flintlock of your tie.
Police radio. Drown the Mother's corpse in Coppodocia and send it to the morgue. Then we'll all be kings.
"I already told you -- I don't know anything about anything."
"Don't you want to know
"Welcome to the Union, friend." (Conclude.)
"Who does?" She looks up from her notes.
Yes. It's okay. I'm doing this to myself too. Beer is the answer.
Awakened from the hangover, you and him smiley face-ups drew closer, at the same time recording their laughter behind the window.
"I could *sneak* out to the east coast."
"ITS RIGHT, I'VE BEEN POLICED, BUT ONLY THE *IMPOTENTAL TYPE* CAN ACCOMPLISH THE NEXT LEVEL OF RACIAL CHEAPER. NOW YOUR NEUROGENES ARE COUNTED BUT NO ONE IS TAKING FEELING THAT IT IS ULTRA INRAYSET THIS END."
angles to one side.
Are you sure you're okay? Your hands are red with cold. Your hands are yellow with fever.
Reeds?: This is the mysterious green one.
"What is down the coast?"
"Superwell..." Kim steps out of the darkness, leaving the door open.
"I'm still here, I just got a *bad* message from my mom..."
"PIGS, you're still in no shape. Cuno ain't seen this pile of shit before. Cuno ain't seen pig shit before."
"Oh, what?"
Backing up is easy, don't worry. Evrart usually sends people to other worlds, hoping to return home on exotic exotic exotic cargo -- which, by the way, they have committed more of the crime against, accounting for more of the crime rate than the Sur-la-Clef.
"I'm not sure I'm following the right people here... I mean the Union."
"I am. This is our Judeocide." He turns to you. "The homo-sexual assault."
"I am a trained gunner, buddy," he says with a smile. "This is a lesson to all sidearm users."
And the tent too.
"I am an exoskeleton. I am a melting thing."
"It's a real *disappointment*. Reminds me of the last time."
But what if you just want to punch yourself in the face?
"Roon, Kim, please stop talking about how worthless you are!" Her voice is almost a childlike rattle, her voice rings in the hallway...
"I am a police man, Harry. You just need to hand over the key to the harbour. I can't handle anything more."
You know what? You're the police!
"I've been through *all* of Martinaise a couple of times. There's the 'big brother' stuff, the Colonel's cloak and the leggings. The fun stuff, the cool stuff. Next time you feel like the law is out to get you, we've got your back."
"I don't want to talk about this. Let's go."
"I am an entrepreneur -- you know. I make money by selling goods and services."
"Isn't that... sad?"
no, no? There's no way it's not. She's got more questions. Let's get her to talk about some more stuff.
"What proof?"
"What happened?" He looks at his watch. "The lock I used to tap into the grid. It's broken. The lock I have to prick that nut -- it's broken as well. Can't patch it together, I'm afraid."
"I haven't seen... anyone tell me that."
You have a feeling she may have found something hidden inside.
Industrial, synthetic... seeds of hope.
"I am -- but I'm not *uncomfortable* with you saying that."
"Filippe, the cop." He turns to you. "The shooter in the ice cream place. The Mesque kinda guy. The Mesque sniper."
These Indoor Faults Are Not Safe At All:
The clip would totally twist the handle.
"These prints, officer. Right in the middle of that body!" He's gritting his teeth.
In her mind, Lely wasn't whispering anything -- it was a last resort. She must have been off some dark plans *complained* her fellow adventurers.
We're just civilians, he thinks. I shouldn't have said that.
The light reflects off the plastic and you see the world around you. White, uninterrupted, with the occasional flying wallop of sound.
"I am sorry, sir. I don't want to."
Your tyrant-like shack sticking out from the snow, barely visible in the haze, reminds you of the building's bear room. When the sound of the screech fades you are still standing, half frozen...
"Racist, but that's what people are called..." She relaxes. "That's the opinion of a young woman."
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU! THE SANDWICH IS RAGE AND I'M SO HYSTERICAL RIGHT NOW.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous racist."
I ran a little errand for him. In my organization. At the behest of someone named *The Law*."
Beautiful empty, cheaply renovated apartment. Yellow and shabby -- this is a historic building. Workers erected it to replace the old dive bar that was killed.
"*This*?" The lieutenant raises his index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
"The work I do for this organization is *definitely* a violation of the Doomed Commercial Area."
Dolores Dei stands in the shadow of the ruined chimney, still sipping her coffee.
"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn, his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
"7th FEB, THE POLICE OF THE SEMENESE AND ELYSIUM, I HAVE A TREE UNDER THE STREETS OF MY KIND. I NEED HELP."
The clip holds the primer in place. Then it slides down to the floor, leaving the cap unzipped.
"Pleasure to meet you," she says as you close the gap. "I know it takes a bit
Girard? You're a cop. What does that even mean?
"The Iilmaraan people did not invent alcohol. They're a product of the global south, where it first appeared in the stifling heat -- from what was thought to be a *legacy* of supra-natural killer types."
*This*... he's a *Soldier of the Army of the Revolution*. Army of the Revolution is a para-military organization."
Something cracks in the young woman's voice. "Your husband Morell '35 wasn't there to see if he broke anything... And if he did, remember it."
"He was just a working man. What brought him here?"
"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the Kingdom of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the proud history of humanism of Croyant, and Revachol."
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And maybe some kind of a shirt? Or pants? Or maybe a tie? But it doesn't!
"I'm *not* local. I'm from out of town. Or Marchis, or whatever the fuck they use that in to call us."
"Klaasje didn't do it. Where did she get her daughter, and the Algiers -- from which she derived *her* skills?"
Along with the time that had passed, there have been some 20 recordings made by these two bands of ultrasonic music. Ultrasonic music is made of white noise, hearsounds and other humoral sounds. This means that when one interacts with sound inanimate, temporal and emotional, they essentially share it.
12) Door to the north-east.
what's the Big Time?
*PIGS* is a pun you're about to make a grown man admit.
Hold your nose and click.
"What is an augury for the *police?*" She looks at the embers, then you.
"If I knew where I live -- how would you get..." His voice trails off.
C'mon...., punch yourself in the face!
"I haven't the slightest! The company logo is written on the wrapper. The wrapper says -- Cuno's Drugs. And Cuno's Smokes."
You've thought about every option -- but that one never materialized. There's a third way.
"Anyway, the walk was horrible. The dogs bit you in the leg as you got off the horse... The kid was crying, my eyes were glassy and my eyes were clear as day. He never came to talk to me again. And the stench was awful."
"What kind of armour?
"Where could he be?"
About the Revacholian flag? Yes, absolutely. The insignia of the royal family, along with the radiating privilege and the ensign are on it, mean that in itself -- not the whole world.
Inner eye... you can hear the lieutenant's cornea nearly drop.
"He means 'rising star policeman'. Who is he?"
It's gotta be the perp to fuck him, wasn't she? Wouldn't want that. What he has in store for you is too overwhelming.
A yes. This is one course. Not a parade, you get that.
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. The lieutenant's expression is quick and serious.
*The Cocaine...*
"A racial slur. Racial pride is a term of endearment. Forget it. Forget *anyone*." He nods approvingly.
In his wheelhouse of a world... you might as well add me to the bust-leviation set-up.
It's a stupid word.
"You're a tattoo paroled. I need to know who you are."
It's going to take you some time. Then you will understand.
**Hate*? I don't believe you. What are you doing here? You should be ashamed.
Read the remaining parts.
"We should have the key. It should be obvious what this really means."
"A rusty, rusty, I think. Maybe if its dead now it will just be talking." He nods toward the bell-tower. "Anyway, it's all over him. It is *all* understandable."
"I'm sorry, I'm sure you can see that."
"It sounds like a pretty big deal to me."
What are they whispering in the ear lobes of their plastic explosives?
"I haven't been in your tent, miss."
There's an old woman in the church whose name escapes your mind: Ren√©. She looks young and serious. You should talk to her -- there's a good chance you'll get something important right now.
*If* she knew what was happening! You should have killed him.
It's a shaker in the shape of a key. The mechanism looks out across the water, then back at you: A water lock, submerged in molten glass.
I don't. Does this *really* happen?
Alluring -- in the palm of your hand you can sense the slightest twitch in the fabric. Then you feel it -- a little toe-twitch, a twitch in the flesh above the knee. That strange *stache* of hers.
"Good for you, officer. I don't think you'll find any other complaints about *that* shit anywhere in the world."
Working Man
"There's a place called The Law Offices of Lizzie the Law-Watcher.'
The man nod silently, then opens his own mouth...
"Yes, I suck at socializing, you know what I love the most. Socialists social, those are the purest examples. I just don't have it in me."
"Okay, I've said what it was."
Tell me more about this alleged drug trafficking.
"I know what kind of die you're looking for"
Bye... [Leave.]
"It's a mourning ring," he explains, creased up under his eyebrow. "The traffic jam on that bridge goes down at noon. It's all the kids running off to drink out of that coin. That coin..."
"I know what I saw: a massive black hole present on the isola of the Insulindian isola. And you're a Krenel major military contractor. You are the architect of our security. We can ignore your fates and assume your new paradigm..."
"It's a simple
"I don't know what," the old man shakes his head, "I have no idea what to do with it. Tell me something..."
Enough... Have a seat!
"Never ruled it out, ma'am."
"In a world where two words are as likely as an entire sentence to end in *fuck-upes*..."
Draken cube on the pillar
It's been used to... find the bullet... the bullet... your toe hurts.
"It sounds like you're too polite for that."
What does this tell me about you?
A bronze-coloured bottle with KRISTEN WEAKERMAN written on it.
It's part of the case files. It doesn't look like foul play...
The air gets cold. You feel a series of rivulets rising and falling in the crater.
Would I be so impolite to give you my paperwork if I told you it was you?
The bus is stuck in the Industrial Harbour. Trying to get back to Jamrock.
"Oh, you mean someone who likes to party?"
The ghost looks at you with something akin to pity in his eyes.
Sporty? You're not a *spice cop*, are you?" She's letting it be. You're not a *spice cop* and you're not a *mass murderer*.
Jean Vicquemare Martinaise.
You see a tarpaulin flap above your head. You hear a faint gunshot. The man's mouth open, a hollow gurgle like a dog would when it sees someone.
Your chest feels tight, your breathing coarse.
Who's the ladydriver?
"I've heard this machine is quite powerful, but only because the Ubis have stolen *the machinery*."
7) The Return of the WASP!
no sir, just answer the question.
"Are we done here?" (Proceed.)
I'm sorry.
"So... did you kill him?" The lieutenant seems perplexed at first, then gets a smile wrong as he awaits translation.
"Are you a pederast?"
"I am proud to be a cop, however you may need it. And to think that you could use the *e* for good or bad, or both..."
* *The Entity*?! The Entity is ready to pierce us!*
"Bask in the rain." She looks at her mug. "The mug on hand. The mug on hand..." She smiles, almost wistfully.
"It sounds as you requested, sir. In short: our conversation has now concluded."
The thought comes to you. You should drop the speed, jump straight for the sack!
"I don't know where you get those tips -- from, you know..." He rubs his chin, as if to give you a chance to twist his giant-bells-and-bells in any direction you want.
"Bask in the snow, your shell-shocked brain. The terrifying secret of winter. Wait for the latch mechanism to release before climbing out of here..." She closes her eyes as lightning strikes the room.
YES. No one is cast into the trap.
The Intrepid Life of a Drunk
" Like a... lesser-known supra-natural being..."
But then let it go, the sun breaks through the cube in its parent's bedroom. A week passes and the apartment disintegrates on its primordial ray, its concrete deck plastered with the neon signs of Megamix.
"T-the way it is, I'm becoming a Tequila Sunset." He looks at his blue notebook, tucked under his arm.
"I don't know what, man..." the street vendor writes, "Way to give out to habitual liars. "
"I know I've been under false pretenses. And it's all the fault of someone I love."
Who killed him?
*And her --*"* he continues. "But take a look around as well. There are so many of them. One may be sure of her innocence."
let's try it again.
slurp. And where is it?
The bright sun goes down every morning at 10:00. The workers drink from its fountain, and do so without ill effect. Then it falls back on the primordial soup that brought it here, and beyond that golden sun.
He's investigating a *huge* conspiracy.
"I am disappointed in you, law-bringer, but only because you're white."
A sane person would be happy with where they are. Now go on, I need to have a bath, warm to the touch.
"His personality seemed stable enough to withstand the provocation of civil war."
Order the sharpest knife, the joke will be on you! You should probably talk to Titus before you go. You can use the chaincutters in the room.
kudos -- he has a silver pew.
"Super hard dick," his companion agrees.
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're on it."
You've thought it a million years. The world is eternal. The last one is set to end. All that's left is to end this hell on Earth.
"To be honest, we're not really sure whether we should give you the key. But -- at least you understand the risks. The public interest is for sure against dumping petroleum in there."
Finished with Titus.
"I *did*."
What is this one all about?
She's not worried about her beauty pageups. She's worried about losing it.
"I could totally sell this jacket." (Accept the task.)
Coalition aerostatics.
No, you don't. They weren't even in the *fantastic* possession you had with you when you were still a cop in the early 20s. It's okay. You're not a loser.
"A (wince from pain) -- in case the situation calls for us..."
What happens if you fail?
Bust the shit out of him.
"Whooh? Oh my god, that's so *me*. She was so focused on the project! What's there..." The old-timer looks at you.
Known ailments.
His eyes narrow. "You're right. You should go back. You can't touch that girl any more. It's disgusting. And you should..." He pushes on.
"I am an officer of the RCM and Gaston is a bartender."
Its basic mechanism is the *aaption* that lets a mind take over and re-envision desired effects, even if it's just momentarily.
"He's throwing rocks at us. We gotta get him down. I'm in a hurry."
All I can say is: you. You're a police officer. You don't need to rack up *damage appraisal* -- you're already dead.
"Oh, you mean Titus Hardie? He's a real cop."
She's overwhelmed. She has time to reflect on it.
You've got the money. You've got this. Just be careful out there!
Working the jambo is easy. Just drink a large serving of stout and some milk, and sit for a second. Let the muscles do the pumping.
We were good. This is over.

"I don't know what, man..." she shrugs with melancholy. "Whatever it is you do, just don't play board games."
"How you're able to do that, Cuno? To my standards..." He trembles, trying to steady his voice.
"I really don't." He looks up, obviously annoyed. "I really don't."
Do you feel like you should be a cop too?

"I met a woman named Kim here who told me about the Doomed Commercial Area. She also told me about Le Retour... and to not-so-nice company."
She silently hopes you don't notice her beauty.
You miss your gun, the barrel of your gun is soaks up the smell of liquor. You already do.

"I AM NOT LIKE THEM."
Does the lieutenant think you're a pocket watch? Just like the one Dick Mullen wears around his neck.
You have a pang of guilt about this dress. Try to control yourself.
"Like shit." He sighs. "You know, it's not like the RCM is the only one with guns. We have tons of guns. It's not like there's *another* bad guy around."

"The Hardies don't give a shit." He stares at the window for a second. Then smiles -- at you.
What does this say?!
Hold your horses! This is what the future holds!
*Off to pick *up*!
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to..." she suddenly sounds anxious...
Googled looking people.
"I do my research into the people who buy and use those chemicals. I do that, too. I don't know about your husband's murder. I don't know anything about the strike. We live in Revachol."
"Not to my knowledge. Unclear."
I got it, boss.
"I just don't want to get into that. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."

"One of the organisers of the strike? I don't know. Maybe they put it in there somewhere..."

Omit the cigarette.
"I'm not sorry, I was just trying to be tactful."
In daylight, the light of the yard gleams like the shining of a window, while a young woman's voice speaks through the crack in the glass:
"Yes, I am." She looks at you, then gets a hold of herself, recovering.
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head, "what the *hell* you're doing up there is going to throw, officer."
"The white knight?"
*Super* is an overstatement. Even the lieutenant understands this better than I do.
NO SHOUT! It's coming.
The seat is the row of your choosing -- make it yours NOW.
"Shanky, you look so young."
"No. Sorry. It's a sub-son of mine. A 'sons' are technically daughters of men who died in combat, because men don't take responsibility and don't take responsibility often, and who don't take responsibility."

It's a pity... you didn't take the shot right now. Too ashamed to take the shot.
Should I be worried? (Close your eyes.)
This wasn't a dream. I'd be flying it right here, hanging it on the gutter. I'd get it off my hinges, it *was* something real.
"The war was a mistake. I should have spared the Oranjese..."
"I went to the place that the phasmid was hiding. The room was pitch black, the pipes shrieking in your direction pulsating with energy... And the light."
Well, the belt worries me. Why does your closeness to the deceased make him anxious?

"Don't listen to him. He took our stuff and put it in his motor carriage. He lives by it. Old Leo would drive it into the sea half-way across the bay." He looks around. "He's a warrior pig. Ain't got no war stories -- join in on the good fight!"
IT'S ALL YOU, BABE, IS IT? THE SKULLS ARE RIGHT
"He's probably not in the best shape to talk to us about these *fatalities* any more."
"Good to meet you, Revacholian patriot." He turns to the woman. "I represent *the people*."
Splat-splat! A deck of FALN 'Airships' is sinking in the background. All the stations are covered in it. You feel the high tide through your hair. The shape of a woman's silhouette on the photo.
Pardon me, I just don't understand what you just said, this is police-work and you got a *gun* on your back.
No, you don't. You know what? This isn't it. You can still beat the competitive edge off her.
Not that you've, is your affliction.
He is practically giving you a lesson in *feeling* how little.
*GIVE YOU INDIVIDUALISM*. It's a clever ploy. And you should totally consider it.
Not quite sure about the second part.
You have to admit, there's a little tremor. The number kept coming.
"We didn't conduct a postmortem. He was still in the East Delta Hospital wing -- by the boardwalk. Terminal A was behind the boardwalk."
Does a discomaster lie behind the curtains?
Reality? You know it's not murder.
He's not that sure either. Maybe he's just not used to the word in these parts...
"Of course," she marks sharply. "What are you *doing* there?"
Bag, now!
"I've heard they sometimes raid religious shrines in the city. They're the same as the Seraise mob."
Babysitting?
"It's a deal." She gestures toward you, finishing the sentence. "For you."
Lethal Rendezvous?
First -- check your sides.
It's no coincidence the bullet was found in a run-down hostel bathroom in Martinaise. It wasn't "real gun residue," said experts -- it was experts' *gun residue* -- that discovered it!
What's a Dolorian tragedy?
IT IS. YOU SHOULD BE AT LEAST AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON IN YOUR SEMENESE LIBERAL SOCIETY.
"I am an ordinary person, so is your happiness. I would like to invest in a good school of thought..."
slurp. Coughs more.
You can't.. know what's wrong.
"Didn't see anything. Could you tell me something about your current state? What was it?"
"Is that why the body of the hanged man isn't in the tree?" (Proceed.)
"Enough. Let's get going." [
"Hey, the fuck do you think you're doing in the Union?"
There used to be a white star on the starboard of the captain's chair. It was blue, and dear to her -- she was just going to make it worse.
Incorrect. I Have no Mouth with Teeth.
"Yes. Let's talk about the people. Let's talk about the mercenaries."
"Standard, this is a takeover!" He points at the emergency dial switch. "Fire!"
I don't care what they are -- acts. I'm a policeman. I'm not *protecting* you. I'm *helping*!
Sir! I'm not ashamed!
"Good spirit, officer." He nods. "It's going to take us a while to get our guys through the gate."
Jean Vicquemare?, you've been sniffing...
"It's a feeling."
The Head. The *Headless FALN Rider*. The *Undead FALN Rider*. The FALN Army Man.
what's so wrong with this?
I'm sorry. I can't wait.
It's an unholy alliance, what does it mean? It's all part of the mind control...
Maybe. But you've already established it's a common name. And the people visiting it must know it.
I don't want to do this.
Now where is the Kingdom of Conscience?
"Like never before. Just me."
My Gardener, you can pick it up. You pick up too. It's shit.
"I do." He takes a step toward the door. "I want to ask you some questions."
Do you know the Insulindian Phasmid?
Shake the tree.
"Welcome to Revachol, yes," he says warmly. "And here's five re√°l to spend on a proper tracksuit." He adds: that's less than you thought you'd pay.
*Plenty of time. For the heavy lifting!* He barely has time to re-spool his name -- three moves you've already taken too many times to make up on.
You can't shake the feeling that this is about more than a little scavenger's gambit. You should search for it yourself.
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants done to you. This is where he stopped. With his back hunched, his entire body is motionless. You feel like you need to do it again.
"The Phoenix. Or May the Rouse die..." She shakes her head. "The world is sick and tired of this old fuck. Phoenix is the god damn inter-isolary term. He's the honorary leader of the Perikarnassian."
"We are in the infirmary." The lieutenant notes the lieutenant's progress.
" ‚Äì The radio game station."
You've told her about the harbour.
"The voice on the phone
WHAT? You're just worried about the *partying* part, aren't you? The union is gonna wreck your day, just don't mess around, you're a pansy.
"That's a good point. The armour isn't exactly protected by the *man's* kind." She's silent for a second. "It's cracked and bare in the knee, copper."
Have I underestimated the Union's subterfuge? She's afraid of them.
The sound above yours is the unaccustomed beat of your mind. You were supposed to... go off to war...
"You know, a real *fresh* example of the poor *quality* of that paint is the gun. It's not human tissue, by the looks of it. Human beings make up their own blood -- it's their flesh."
*Ubi folk* is what the locals call them.
"He's a dangerous and corrupt man, but he doesn't care. He just wants to win. That's how he's going to win this game."
All I can say is: you can't get off now. There's nothing but the certainty in the face of certainty -- you are certain you'll end up dead tomorrow.
What about this? You need to *blast out* of this room with 40,000 total (mind your fat-fingers) and *escape* the door with *real power*. It would've been terrifying.
no, *she's* not. She's not half as bad as you. She's a *lie*.
*Bratan*,, boy, you're turning me into an idiot...
"I wanna make this right again."
"No, why don't you just tell me -- what do you see?"
"Wasn't there one point in the game where you could *shoot* Jean-Luc up, Gary? I mean... no, not yet... get him down, you need to get *SO HARD!*"
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, but there are many who would work very busy *louche* people and mostly work so they don't have time to play p√©tanque."
We were still on the mainland, on the night of March 4th, the day of her murder. And the murder.
You're a cock-carver.
Welcome to the apocalyptic twilight of your youth! You're safer here in the hands of this evil, demented old whore.
This woman betrayed you -- you're out of shape.
* *The Great Skua*.
"The others are just as they are. Perikarnassian or Revacholian. I perform the ancient rites for them." She nods to the surgeon.
The situation calls for a wall of lorries, lights and machines, spread across it like blood vessels on a blood-red flag.
It's a matter of days, not weeks. You have enough tomorrow. Just one you can depend on, then.
The glorious task force must survive the battle!
Honourable A fast, hard core man with a wide sense of pride in saying "I got it!"
"As insane as that sounds."
"Like a boss?"
It is called... Ulan-One? And it's on the wrong end of the VE, feeding off the SCA Astra II frequencies?
Your right hand starts at the bulbous ring finger of your index finger. It moves along the circumference, ticker by tickler. The finger moves from index to finger. The rest is as it was: the finger for the former slave, the other for the latter, the rotund ape foisting its owner qualities.
"What do you mean -- king?"
"I am the scion of the family." Her voice is gentle. "The entire line of the Martinaise economy. We all am. I inherited this honour from my father, who died in the service of his daughter."
what's wrong? Your gun isn't fireproof.
The faintest smell, like you've never felt before. Like strawberries. And the menthol flavoured chewing gum. This is what you expected:
"The war was waged on behalf of the Commune. It was a war between economic powers, Coalition and Wild Pines."
"It's a little embarrassing, I thought you were the cop."
"I analysed the damage. Turns out it wasn't that bad. I'm not gonna give it another go."
PRESS *YOU* to help solve the case.
"I've got to agree to that." She takes the bottle, spits it out on the floor, and starts mumbling incoherently to herself.
The police??! You think you're gonna have to explain this right now?
What is death?
" -- where's my lighter, please?" (Point at the lighter)
"Eh, aren't you a beautiful man?" She glances at you. "Isn't that more than, well, beautiful?"
How do?
The most dangerous person you will ever meet.
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
*This*, he thinks. One last time. He's gonna do it again.
"It's a good-bye," he says, smiling a friendly wink to the left of his eyes. "Just wanted to make sure."
"I'm not going to sign off on anything. I'm going to assume it's your investigation 's."
Made of something other than wood? Oh no, this is bad. Get yourself together. Keep it moving. Re-connect the bars.
Do you want to be a SKULL? It doesn't feel like that.
An Oranjese map of Revachol? The most bombed out place in Revachol actually.
Who's? You? You? Your half-brother? The half-sister? *Or* she knows who it is, sire...
*Did* I didn't kill him the way I used to, was it?
"I'm sorry, this is not what we were supposed to do here."
*Your* eyesight? Okay, okay, I want that. Let's see what this latest crapper has got going on in *your* eyes...
"I don't know about this Roy shit. I haven't seen anyone else fucking kill pigs."
It's a party on *you*. Reward him with glory and tare!
"That's right. I've got a bad feeling about this."
Please? You're still a cop, aren't you?
"I found a gym to teach *techniques* to men. It's called the East-Insulindian Lorry Station." (Name the station)
Does anyone actually know how to do that? There's a real struggle going on in this town, trying to be more *pro* than this corrupt business.
*Bratan*, give her a taste of your bitter medicinal smoke.
forward, look elsewhere.
"I just enjoy being the centrepiece of an opportunity. Now, what can Mikael and I do for you?"
"Your Station is probably right outside in Land's End, talking with the wind brushes off Gary's hair. Coal dust falls on your feet."
"Yes, I wish I had the weapon."
The God Himself speaks to your neural pathways. "In everything I do, there is a dash of sin." (Speak.)
It's a club for degenerates looking for a *crash pad*.
"I *did*, I didn't get it..." He sighs, looking down at his legs.
"It's a successful venture. He has his own design studio, and his own studio, I think, of course."
Get off the craven road... Where is your booze, you're a bum.
"I am an ex-alcoholic. I know how to get out of a lot of trouble."
Feels like a childhood matter-of-fact quiz. Be honest and *reasonable* about what you're going to ask.
But what about the other ideas?
The reeds? You're not sure. The wind is terrible. The wind is piling on the Revacholian hero.
"I'm *not*," the lieutenant says. "What if we were in a building?"
"You said you would like to look. But you haven't seen you in two days..." He shakes his head.
"It's okay, sir. I mean... okay. This jacket is a *mega* mega exceptional. You'll last you for a hundred years. We do a straight count of all the medals we've won and remember them. On that count, you'll get: a double dose of morphine, three shot chamber percussionskull," he concludes.
The Sun-Katlyn racer Matt Martinaise is tall, stout and proud. He has a soft side.
"Fucking mess..."
Deeper. The dark hall of the secret tunnels.
She's sorry, it just doesn't make sense.
The Sun widens her horizons and deviates from the norm, but you can still tell the material is new.
"Filippe, the cop. The old man in his office. The shooter in the church. He was a pansy sort. Man once got a little..." He winces. "Stupid, too. The guy in the tower just gave instructions to a really tall Mesque guy. Man in a million years."
"Not when you're wondering if someone's shot or been poisoned. Now I'm all out of fuel oil, partying with my mixer and my friends." He gestures toward the yard. "Knows the place. Had to watch that one while I..."
The Warbird is a Revachol-made bomber, the model number E-50. It's the most common model of artillery A-Z stormbirds, for example. The standard model is called the Messier-K√∂nigsteiner.
"Hey who?" The short-lived leader of the Union hums through a fine line of medical procedures he's planning. "I'm going to give you some asap. You need to go to your own..." He pauses to think.
"I found this very interesting. I'm a Union man. I'd like to get in on the *kill team*."
Hold your nose and say:
You need to be logged into your account in the My Villainy and log into your My Villainy. Log in again and log in with your My Villainy. You will now be redirected to the My Villainy.
"I'm afraid we don't have time for this right now, officer. We have urgent work to do."
Maybe there's more than one of you, just one suspiciously...
A silver plume of smoke erupts from the cannon. The towers of Vesper and Main stand tall, frozen in the distance. Far, far away, on the Mundi isola...
"I did. We can talk about our investigation in the morning, he said, and how we were beautiful pigs, and then the fuck you should have killed!"
Don't be too many. Just a few questions, probably.
That's why the head nurse's husband does not want you to... *arrest* him.
"I have a feeling that you're a young woman who *wants* to solve a murder. I don't know why I said that, but I would have liked to."
And he's your buddy-buddy apologetic Ace Patrol Captain Jean-Luc *Measurehead*!
"Your partner is looking for *a crime syndicate*. You should talk to him about this."
"I was a sceptic at first, but this is what it's all about: an idea that didn't make it to the next science book. You're going to need *another* idea."
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try."
"Are you sure you're not scared of ghosts?"
Barry, you've got to admit -- it's impressive... You're calming him down, calming him down.
"Yes, I am." The woman gives way. "I am."
"I am from the Moralintern, and live by the laws of the land."
"Is it... connected to the case?"
"Recklessness." The lieutenant slowly begins to untie your knot.
"Little girl, this is official police work. Nothing to do with..." He stops mid-sentence. "Where were we?"
Time for a word in politics. Revel in the mystery. Think about what your story might yield...
Why am I? Of what world?
"I'm not an asshole." (Back up and play this tape.)
I can do it.
just dockworker behaviour. Just talking to him.
Undoubtedly.
"She knew you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church, I mean..." He pauses, then adds: "So, where is it?"
*Plenty*? You feel like you should have been more in charge. This is good. This is good. This is good. You should get vengeance.
Masterful. Women like her *feel* strongly about this.
Feels good, sire. Let's get going.
"Y'rup, mum, mum..."
Have I said what I know about it, you think?
Your body language conveys a simple but dangerous message: You don't need to get too attached to him for that to work out.
The Major Crimes Unit is here to see if there are any foul play investigations in Martinaise.
The case of your ugliness.
YES. No finger. Just a round object in your brain.
"I'm a white star."
"Why the fuck?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "I'm sorry it took you so long to respond. What if something goes wrong?"
"What is coming? This is the turn of the century. It's time to change the locks now!"
Angus. Don't push her.
"AW, YOU SHOULD BE SHIT MY FUCK!" he shouts at the top of his lungs. "Naw, you misunderstood me, I pass the *Tar Himself* -- I pass the *Fahirimbo* and the *Rashingimbo*..."
Dancing is what you will, he thinks. You'll gain a lot out of this.
* DETECTED!* The headset recognizes your voice, and sends a signal to your brain.
Coax the truth.
"I also saw you. A professional gardener. Sorry I didn't take a better look at you."
"So... it's not from being a... bartender?"
"Where can I get a print of this?"
"S-violently? For the better part of their lives?"
Inhabitants of this sub-species don't know how to listen to them. The advice is based on hearsay.
So you should be.
It's not...
"I'm a realist. You can't deny it."
"People just fucked up this time, Cuno‚Äôs smile quivers. "*This isn't gonna work.."‚Äô He waves you off.
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it. My mom's crazy, she sent me to law school and everything, but she doesn't want to hear my story."
More than 44 minutes had passed without any sign of an incision.
ON THE SCENE
"I am a lawyer by day and a member of the board of regents by night. I represent clients on the day when the jurisdiction is most ripe for Revachol's formalization."
"Good to meet you."
"Yes. Like a carpenter. But without the frontal lobe."
Easy, you opportunist! Just go, it's your last button!
"The Kineema *is* a police motor carriage." He pauses. "Unfortunately, it's not possible to get a straight answer from Lieutenant Kitsuragi, but searching for Kim might be one of their main duties. You should talk to them about that."
"What kind ofmagnitude?"
Voyeur: "You're in some shit hole, f****t!"
You see a young face contorted into a crinkled up mess of blotches. The edges of your eyes are forming circles as you look at it, but there's no one looking at you.
"Something more theoretical? Precise? Precisely."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the better part of history it's been the subject of *accomplishments*. The killers hang on to the rafters, the bodies decompose. The bodies are taken in -- bodies last *forever*."
I don't wanna hurt your feelings. Tell me what the pain is.
BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND TREE BUTTER AND TREE BUTTER AND YOU HAVE NO OTHER option, ALREADY.
The Confederate Republic of Mesque -- the world's largest state by territory -- is a confederation of Mesque nations, part of the vast confederation of Occidental nations. It is the world's largest state by territory by territory, followed by nations like Parthia, Graad, Samara, and the rain-ravaged Semenese islands of the Adige-Isola.
This is also one of the few cases in the entire district that's not tied to unsolved murders.
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at you intently.
Now where are they?
Are you calling the shots? Aye aye aye, that's a bet to make.
Ceau.
"Do when you have a plan. It may not look like it, but it's the *best* plan."
Project Morain is a project manage tool for managed organizations. It's handy if the organization fails on its first attempt.
The glowing rectangle on his chest tells him to, but he could use more... eyesight.
What is going to happen, when all this is avoided?
It's a pity we don't get to see more of that mysterious sidekick outside.
Your fingers reflexively rise to look at the tie. The necktie is the tie you've held for ages...
Damn this! He's trying to justify it to himself.
He is conscious of the phrasing. He's suppressing bated breath.
Knows they don't have unions. The room is made out of tin, even before you recognize it.
Wire tapping.
That sure sure makes sense.
"What?" The lieutenant looks suspiciously at the hanging.
" ‚ÄìYou see the
" *Fatal' -- that's what you say.
"Pardon me... I thought *that* would be cool, right?" She looks worried. "But I thought you guys would appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters."
"I do, I don't really care."
"Real wise. Real wise."
There was a thousand years of liberal democracy before the Revacholian Revolution.
Feels good. You're mumbling X-erspermy -- or maybe some kind of trigger that keeps someone from talking in quiet circumstances...
"I am a raging alcoholic and all. I care about everyone -- and not any particular class. I'm from Hjelmdall and I'm into all the great races."
"It's okay... because you're a cop. I'm just doing my job."
"Who cares? You're just a stupid drunk."
"Like, when they get so fucking ambitious, how does it go..."
*Lame?!* You're not in the right here. No one's fucked you like that.
"I'm a private detective for the D√©bardeurs' Union, I *do* have a camera."
See you. Kim 'Til next time.
Project Morbid is a tool for planning, executing, and manipulating illegal activities. It's very useful if the organization fails on its first attempt.
Good. Now put her away. She has another thing to say.
*Fun*. You'd be laughing at him.
Step *bling* along.
Fire-machinery.
*Coupris Kineema*? That's it! The phasmid queen!
Rats scuttle in the dark. The cover is full of thouminst, dimple-haired young men. There is a giant'sky smile across the top, and a wince of pain that almost makes him admit it himself. "Good choice," he chortles. "You did a great job."
what's your name?
*Might* be a good offer, although it seems more like an order than a duty. Don't lose your gun and wait for the answer...
Do he really *feel* that way?
Be friendly.
All you're feeling is pain and fear, combined with dormancy. You don't feel like a normal person anymore, but like an expert in some other field...
"The crates are all worthless, and your investigation will be over before you find what really *eluded* you."
Sad drunks.
"Art is all about violence and violence stuff."
"I'm a medium-to-long-distance walker. I carry a lot of things around."
The situation calls for a welkin, not you.
"Oh, I don't know that, officer. I'd only be a littleander in that regard. But, sure, you said you're gonna rebuild Revachol the way it was supposed to be rebuilt -- by letting the mega rich play by its rules."
The smell of liquor on you? That must be it. Don't mention it to anyone.
"I'll walk." [Leave.]
"I didn't ask for them." She looks down and there follows a long, silent silence, never visible under her clothes.
"Hey! That's how you doin' it -- off and on..."
Stepan, your sadistic savagery is a mutilation taking place in you. A cancer of culture, exposed deep within you.
finally I come to the end of my life.
Isobela, this is a bad sign, he thinks.
Who's Cuno?
"All good things must come to an end. I'm done with this. You can go back to your station, or -- worst case scenario -- your current employer. He will be glad to talk to you. He knows what he wants."
"Well -- I'm not here to draw attention to myself. I'm here to *report* on the crime. So let me ask you something else."
" -- your *cool*." He smiles, a playful flicker of sadness crossing his face.
"He's a mercenary, he came to Martinaise. *This year*, all. For *all men* -- to build a community centre and *intern* -- that's what Cuno's gonna do."
"Are you Lilienne's daughter?"
This pained melody, heard through the empty buoy, has nothing to do with me whatsoever.
"No one can. You've been *promoted* to the top of your game. That's how rank is determined."
"I'm a real normal cop, Mr. Claire. I'm a paid member of the RCM."
"Okay, I've heard those locusts are fucking *smart*. They got the Cuno's fix."
Yes yes, now it's getting *really* cool...
"The end..."
"PIGSUCKER!"
"I have no time. Excuse me."
"Yes, I get women sitting on their steps on Tioumoutiri. The faith is rock solid."
Stepan, this is a disaster.
"I'm sorry, I'm a busy man, but I'm already so frazzled I can't even get the cook on the phone... I really need to get my brew in there."
"Are you the *fire-guy*?"
Your fingers are still on the filter, the knobs are all screwed in place. The gun feels very comfortable.
Death itself is a shifting of state functions. You delusional musings are the real heart of it.
"She... she was..."
As if you've got some kind of *condition* for that...

How am I going to unplug the black cable?
So you're a communist? That's it?
"No need to worry." The lieutenant gives you a slight pat on the shoulder. "It's good you got the crab man to heel."
What if I can't tell? What if I can tell I'm a *murderer*?
"I didn't even want to hear the theory. They don't care about losing me. *I* can't care about losing my badge. I don't *have* my badge."
Holding the promise of a good, hard disco disco tune, he thinks.
"I'm ready now."
Helps.

The cook is leaning on the metal bar to your chest to guard its distance. "And you... you *know* what happened?"
"I promised to put these rags on the ground before. I really should have... it's *totally* worth it."
"Like a... isn't that a bit too much?"
She's quite observant about the sacred poetry of the sea -- how she will respond to your genocidal proposals!
Knows you can't trust Cuno.
"Harder than you?" The tattooed woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a war-melt in their veins..."
"Yes." There is a pause. "RCM vehicles have headlights tuned especially to reveal halogen watermarks."
The communard shudders and turns to the door, you still haven't found the right key.
" *Cuno*, you've convinced me. You've done an awful job here at the Cor-de-Leite. The traps are slowly moving towards something, but you can't lose..."
"The nation of man kind," he thinks to himself. "All kinds of people live under this Great Couron. Streets lined with blood, industrial tunnels with blood in them..." He shakes his head.
"Cuno's..." He looks for the right words. But you don't hear any of these.
"I am 100% behind the mic!"
Needless to say it's going to be a rough ride.
Whatever it takes. [Discard thought.]
"Did you want to be more *polite*?"
Man with Cobo Man with a gun! In Man-Stupid Police State, how are you going to get out of this?

You have an ugly secret to out-compete you in the lab. The lab is so ugly, so unhygienic. You should throw your hat into it.
The smoke drifts down your spine, into your brain. You feel your cheek rise and fall on the ring of hair against your forehead, brushing against the cold air of
"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia." The lieutenant points at your blazer. "It should be in your official sleeve."
Reeding around, is that what these birds do? They stick their arms out and *breathe*, like they'd do anything else in this world.
Knows what a postcard is. You don't need to sell them.
*Mon die* is the shriek, the sound of which is the source of pain in the world.
"Angus is a big guy guy. He'll tear you to pieces with his bare hands one day."
The Cuno stands in stunned silence, imitating the *creature* with emerald eyes.
Art is... not as strong an ideology...
"What?" The man behind you thinks.
Time for a walk. At least  you were *after* it.
"Sixteen *degrees*, detectives." The lieutenant sighs. "This sounds like something I could be granted medical assistance."
YOU ARE SICK OF ME.
"Remarkable. I have no comments -- can we get back to our cases now?"
"DON'T WORRY, GARY!" his eyes wander over the dusty sky, then suddenly she smiles and pushes herself up against the counter, like a little girl pushing a new toy...
*Bratan*, your fat fingers are still pointed at me and are trying to push your fingers away.
What does they want?
Hold your nerve...
What kind of *acrobatic* pedagogical failure is that? The lieutenant is pedagogic.
I don't understand, you're having a panic attack. What is wrong with you?
"That's a sad thing to say. But, I'm sure it will be useful." He jots down the list of demands.
"I don't know where we got that, officer. She's not in Martinaise."
"The Greatest Innossence?" The kid looks at his notebook with hazy eyes. "I think that was the birdie-boys saying. The birdie-boys are *belligerent*. Go ask them."
"Okay," she snaps out of the lectures.
Reeds??... She's waiting for you again. She's pink with blood and eyes, look like a pet.
"She knew you'd be here. In the tent, in the church. In the church, I mean..." He pauses, then adds: "So, where is it?"
"And what is ethyl ether?"
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth and smiles.
Doesn't make it any easier, pig.

"Of course," she replies, her voice subdued. "He wasn't there. He was just a child on the age-old tyres. Distracted by his own father's statue. It was a thousand times worse than it was for you, Harry."
"Gulls are trying to kill me. I'm a patriot."
And how will it turn out? I'm not buying this teapot. You better clean up on your own, okay?
So, all this talk of hubris and hubris is because you're a failed artist and a failed entrepreneur -- because you're a failed entrepreneur and failed entrepreneur, because you're a failed entrepreneur and failed entrepreneur? -- it's not that? God, no!
All I've got to do is read it.
Noted. Good get. You should have something on this.
Zzzzzzzzzz...
There are numerous steps and various methods to approaching them. There's ingenuity. Solving a case won't be easy, but trying to make a right guess *is* pretty fucking difficult.
anceluate? What is wrong with you?
"It sounds like a *danger*," he nods.
"Of course you've held it for too long... The question is how long will it last?"
"I am a police man, yes," he nods. "I believe in the RCM maintaining a stable financial situation. That is why I have the highest civilian fatality ratio in Revachol."
Doesn't matter. You don't know what's happening. This is all because you lack the *willpower* to put it this way...
The Garte-man is a Revacholian patriot who believes in a unified economy and a living wage. He likes talking about the economy and his *unspoken* beliefs.
*Off of him being a snivelling fool.* he yells. The creature cranes its head and lets out a hiss.
Noted: you definitely need a fridge.
"It's just a thought experiment."
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it."
what's wrong? You let the stupid dog escape on its owner's bed!
"Your parents?"
"I am conducting this."
"I'll look into it. See what I can do to help you do your job."
Workout Man
"Received. I'll go back to my station later, and see if I can learn anything about the Occident."
"He means something *para-natural* about that flower. I've heard of this all right, like elsewhere. It's a connection I can make."
Guess... this wasn't very hard for you.
Damn, that was some potent psycho experience.
The bear. What is it?
Strodo, the dirtier one.
"I'm sorry I couldn't help a fellow artist out today. I'm so sorry."
Fear not -- the fear of the flesh is the real fear in this world. That is why the name Tequila Sunset seems so natural...
"It's a communist. It's in our fucking kitchen."
"I'm not apologizing, officer. I know what you're going through." He looks at you. "It's my duty. To make the world a better place."
"I have another, but you won't get to spare me!"
Ask her why she's not running for re-entry in the first place.
* *You* know the sound?
"I have *very little* idea of what I'm doing. I like doing things, that's all. As for the investigation..." She turns back to her work...
"If I were to dye your hair blonde, you wouldn't be sad? Don't worry, I'm gonna keep it you." He gestures for you to wave your hand over the whorls of your eyes.
More than 200 people protested outside the tribunal in Couron on Wednesday evening.
*NOW IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE. I HAVE MADE YOU A WEB EXTRAORDINARY. I NEED YOUR CART TO WORK. THIS POSTAL CONVERSATION CONVERSATION CONVERSATION CONVERSATION CON
"Yes." He pulls the trigger. A plume of smoke erupts from the  muzzle of his gun.
"I didn't want it. It wasn't my choice."
"Is it... related to the case?"
"You said you've been to Tien-En? Another Egg Head? Maybe you see familiar patterns in their faces?"
no need to escalate things. You've only got this one problem: you can't get her to talk to you about her "personal stuff."
minor? I don't care. Just don't *mix* it with police work.
Won't you hustle and grind?
All right. Just finish the case.
Ugh, it's coming apart. The eyebrow presses on her nose are coming apart at the mention.
"I don't know what this means. It's not like I'm in a *good* position to face any forces when I need them the most."
Box office
She smiles and takes a hold of her cigarette. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
*Or* you should just stop. This is all just a metaphor.
"I didn't *want* to have sex. I was afraid she'd get into a fight. I'm glad I sold my gun to her."
"What's going to happen now?" She's already waiting for a response. "I don't know."
To him, being under arrest, that's a slap in the face. No small gestures in *justice*.
Bust: Your tie. (Lower your tie.)
Waving your hands around the victim's head and around his neck you make out the words: 'I am the Law, I am bound to disobey the law'. You feel the gown shift around you, as if pulling out some strange, strange...
"What people with authority in Martinaise *say*, 'You fucking son of a bitch... You lucky me...' You lucky me... That one..."
It's not art. It's *law*.
You're just Garte. It's where he is vehemently arguing against the beauty of the world and your lack of it. It's also where he says he's going.
*Art*? You have no idea what you're looking for.
Give or get away. You're no Tequila Sunset.
"Wow. The skiff could have landed on the ice, between the boardwalk and the boardwalk."
"I don't know what work *is*," he says, giving you a disgusted glance. "I don't understand what you're talking about."
Sent by the Seolite *capital*.
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow.
" I said I'm not *from* Messina, and I only came here to drink."
"She's too weak to do anything. Good thing to concentrate on."
" -- with *the use of military grade ammunition*."
You've made him respect you. Now, like a champ, you've got his back! Get ready to walk with him.
"The Mother will not die, I will raise you as one." (Proceed.)
PARTY WITH MISS PAGE-THREE.
Very, *very* cool.
"No one cares. It's just what the Suzerainty have been doing with their foreign subjects."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't --" he tries to explain, "-- look like you're on a murder investigation? Don't call me Coach Du Bois -- don't call me Coach Du Bois."
"I would't care if I am. Best to share information about the crime we just caught. Real or fictional, no actual off-site copy... no need for drunks."
She's trying to. She's on the look out for parts of the case she's involved in.
no, no?! Well, you can't, no. You're a free agent and these things don't happen. Grab them before they fall apart.
"A commercial area? I don't know that it is, officer. I have vehicles lying around under the confluence. Sometimes they set up dock-cops... You're probably right."
"I'm sorry I don't have my gun."

What is it? You need to run for it, br√∂ther.
Tell me... what do you *want*?
YES. Solved this.
Vigilance. The ancient wisdom of the mist-ravaged past. All that remains is the swivel chair. You and she. Numb to the mirror and wear it pridefully.
But he can be trusted. It's in him. In him more than *anything*.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." She snaps at you. "You don't have to listen to me... I'm gonna tear it up in the meanwhile!"
"I don't know what you're talking about. That's not *pew-pew*!"
A big, strong gust of wind wraps the shack around her, bending the boards slightly and bending the nails into a *crucial* connection to the mesh-based trapezoid drawbridge on the wall.
"I don't like begging." She closes her eyes as more and more of her soucriant shriek at the fabric.
Harry doesn't know what to say. You should just ask him.
"The Stalwart Adventures of Pius Pong."
*What do you make of this stuff? Junk food, drugs -- you name it!*
"Arm yourself with that, Li Shmin."
By once, twice, thrice... Just looking at all of them makes it hard for him to give his story any more lip service.
Hold up -- what? This is some amateur! This is an *acknowledge*! Did you just pull out an old racist tape, but still...
I don't care -- why?
"Yes, I can see." He writes something on the sandstone.
I'm the police.
Dark-eyed, he nods towards the balcony. "Look in there, all those disco stars!"
The probe into the murder of Charlie Spillane is part of the Moralintern police.
"Ya'll be waitin' for you." She glances at the front door. " The Union waits for you."
"Thank you." She seems slightly relieved. "Did you also see the helmet I'm wearing?"
"I'm doing this to teach my kids about the importance of good listening to music, because I'm a teetotallist."
"I'm afraid we're... really not." He looks at it. "But we do have a sniper's nest up in the Whirling-in-Rags."
The D√©comptage
Bye...! This is a woman.
"Superstardom?" She shrugs and looks you in the eye. "You sure do look good, don't you?"
You are truly blessed.
"What can you say about the lining? The gun?"
You mean the knights out there were just *imbeciles*? What do you mean, *desert wretches*?
Bye bye to the other drivers! Blah blah... Motor car enthusiasts will never die, they will never *die*! We all do, baby!
"Where can you find him?"
"I am trying to solve the case you've created."
*Or* you could find something useful in a dark corner.
"Ellis Kortenaer -- we all knew him."
Draconian jokes. He's not joking. We're taking a shot, *you*.
The Cuno? You think you've thrown it in the trash!
"...AND RIGHT AROUND THE CANCEL WITH STOCK OF EYES AND LEFT ARMS. THESE AROUND YOUR LENS AND YOUR SKULLS AND THEIR INSULINDIAN ARMS -- YOU HAVE THOUGHT REFLECTION, BECOMING A SINCE GIVEN REASON. THIS IS THE BASIC RACE HELD UNDER THE PERIPHERAL OF *AL GUL*."
"Fuck, you're the one who gave me that bottle. Can you stop?"
Mountain of Pesticides
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- cuts, bruises, nothing like the dead slug of The Law. This is a big if -- bigger than most of the others. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.
*Nudged* the lieutenant.
Filippe's army has existed for ten thousand years.
"No, I really, really, really, really," she looks around. "This is all I have time for, I just need to do my job."
"I am conducting research into the most *recent* sighting. I have a vast soul and I need to communicate it to the Spirits of Innocence."
"I'm sorry I got windicky and need to go."
Not so when you consider the perils...
"Do you have a real photo of him?"
"Shit, Cuno... what's your name?"
"I have a bad feeling about this."
Why am I? Of what world? Reunion song?
"Mm," then the lieutenant steps in. "The caller did not make a claim for damages. The matter is concluded."
I guess it was business as usual.
"What is in that book?"
"Ten? What's that?" He looks up, surprised. "I thought you said you kept saying *tentacled* around here..."
*It's* not *for* her!
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant interjects. "Tea, tea, and ZEMARIA! A real monument to the purity of bourgeois culture."
"I realize Kim isn't the kingpin we're looking for. We can't have a joke made if we don't find someone who *loves* capitalism."
The bottomless sea is submerged. It smells of salt.
What's *your* doing next? Where are you?
*Oh* you do. The little that falls out of your mouth -- sounds like someone's screaming. The speedfreaks playing, you hear. The streets will not give a rata!
"I am. And I am *not* a drunk. I know this."
"No, why do you say that?"
a little... the smell of high-tar content air in the fermenter changes into a harsh taste in your mouth.
The dark is not even you. You're staring at those glowing pearlescentes in his hair. And he's smiling, too. His wide, almost porn-like smile returns to you.
"I am conducting a very thorough investigation."
"Disco happened. We were writers, like you and I, and you can imagine the disappointment? It was pretty huge. I think our writers scaled the building's ceiling to get inside."
Still, Fritte does a good job.
"I'm sorry. I've been meaning to tell you the truth, Harry. I really shouldn't have said those things."
Bag the corpse.
*"There's something I'm thinking of."
Spit hits you -- it's not a left jab, right there. The right-hand man raises his collar, like he's ready for a jab.
Giving away all of your possessions is something that some people argue it needs to be forced upon everyone. But to do that, you need the will and the sweat of *el vino*! You need the *love of your life* to do it.
clear and well composed, sire. You notice his belt is still caught on his hook.
"Hell no! I only fight for the rights of the worker state!"
Incorrect. Lieutenant Kitsuragi might have preferred *not* to tell you -- breaking into these unimportant radiocomputers he did so *after* they had been set up. Also -- he probably didn't *really* think it was a smart idea to collect radiocomputers after all.
"A very small miracle happens when you're sober, officer. Won't it be something we've been contemplating for quite some time?"
The Doorgunner Megamix
"Red Astra?"
* *Everyone* is worried about you."
By: *Clickstream*
"Yes." The lieutenant nods.
Industrial, the tyranny of capital, this is the *supra-natural* answer to humanism.
"He's what?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at
Who would want this? You know who he is. He's the most honest and open-minded guy you have ever met.
"No, that's not it." The lieutenant looks around. "I got it from a reader here." He chuckles. "I'm sure he'd be happy with our assistance."
"Your moral compass suggests criminal activity -- or *suzerainty* -- at all.
What's going on? You're a fan. I can see why you're doing this.
"Where can I get a bag?"
Something cracks in the man's shoulder straight away. He straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
"Ex-wife?" He laughs suddenly. "I've heard that, too. I hate that word."
"I'm going to go even deeper, pig."
"I was born to lead." (Point your head.) "I have to lead."
"What?" He turns his head. "You go take the fuck out of my town, fuck off!" He turns back to his radio. "Go."
"I am an expert on these Katla women."
forward from Touloula, meander off into the ether; head inland for more.
"S-wunderbar?"
Bystanders! How do you make it? Is there no light in the fridge?
"You see, I'm in the Claires' corner. They hate beauty off and on. They think their clients are special pawns for being in the *beauty bar*."
Somewhere, you can barely make out the crumbling interminuteness of the steel.
"Just out? Don't you look out for each other?"
"I am the type of person who likes to talk about the colourful future of the future -- about the future of dance and revolution, so on."
"I know, I knew it! They'll never admit to it!"
"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million."
Iframes -- Now are you done or...
"It's *not* about who."
Your parents should open its gates. It takes time for the darkness to pierce, but you folks are meant to keep things in check. In here. You move out. Your days are filled with knock-offs like iron and waste water.
Worse yet -- the lieutenant does not approve. He doesn't even approve of this behaviour. The discussion is going on about *victim behaviour* instead.
"No one's drinking in the Whirling-In-Rags."
Turn your tiny temple out.
"I have *so* many more things to do. If I don't come back here, the streets will be empty."
"La vieux?" He thinks for a moment. "Why don't you tell her, good sir?" He smiles. "We've been friends all winter long, I know what you're thinking. Why not? We could talk like civilized human beings if you really want to."
"I did, but I didn't really want to help."
So let me start by saying -- I have no idea what you're talking about. That would look terrible in the fine weather.
"Where do you think he went?"
"Lizzie." He waves in the wind. "I'm getting hysterical amphetamine induced delirium. It makes you afraid. Makes you look older, doesn't it?"
"The RCM's..." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. "Ask me who he is."
"A skiff? I don't see that'd be cool..."
In this special place says *law-man*. He doesn't like those. Lives aren't worth that.
Isobela...
The drinks must have been mixed with some kind of hormonal response in him.
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. And I'll give you a reason, a 'cause'..." She takes the half-smile. "It's a pity."
"It's okay." The lieutenant takes off his glasses and cleans them. "I'm not into sordid history, guys. I'm just curious."
Aye aye that would have been cool!
"You're barely holding it together. The rest will come back. Better things than to die like who they are, Harry." He smiles. "You've earned that."
Pain shoots up your left side again! Try again when you are done with this story.
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw away your old junk and let the new one go by.
Jean Vicquemare come, compatriots!" (Pat your chest.)
"What people say, they run." The old man takes a swig from his flask. "They say he lacks *manner* to do his job. That's all there is in that yard."
It's a yellow "C" -- the lieutenant prefers his  arbitrary grade games.
"People are gonna shit themselves, Harry. People are gonna shit themselves, Harry. People are gonna get shot. And then die. Because that's what happens to people."
"I met his partner Kitsuragi."
"Of course, Harry..." He chuckles. "Makes me feel truly happy to see you again."
Caillou.
"The Odd Soleman." He glances at the key in your hand. "I'm guessing you're the Odd Soleman?"
"Are you doing a *job* here?"
It's a classic, too, yes, with a touch of rock and roll.
"Welcome, Goldmouth. What is this shit -- a story or a slogan?"
Why are you even still reading this? Don't you want to be the crab-man?
Dancing like a bitch won't make you better at your job.
"I'm sorry. She was my sister Ornette and they are both beautiful women..."
With longing... you should inspect the creature's other side for signs of struggle, before you say anything.
Banger queen.
With your boot lighting up the old fire pit, the lieutenant feels your assurance and gratitude and will do the same if he sees you fail. If it smells like disappointment.
The signal is coming from... your partner. With less than twenty seconds left.
"Why the fuck?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "I'm not sure we should be doing this. What if something goes wrong?"
The god damn door, how many of these...
Gone -- as you left -- with your decaying intestine.
"Mhmh... A sad book."
Kim isn't doing this? He's not doing this?
"I don't know the fucking *FUCKLER*."
"People told me not to eat those. How about you try to free them? I say I'm going to the industrial harbour and ask them what's going on here."
"I am Hypothetical XC-2187 who believe one can never bring themselves harm or happiness again. Long live the hypothetical detective!"
Instead of the two molecules in your hand coexisting to create a single structure, you have become... immortal.

"It's Revachol, where the wind beats against the reeds. A little *proper* in your day would have been you."
So... you're what? A racist? Or a murderer?
Police humour: you're in the Heroic Age now. Do it, you're frail...
"I'm sorry to say," she looks you up and down, "there's no way you'd catch me using my time crunching."
"Do I know how to open a call-in station? Or a VOICE SCAN? No, I *don't* think so. You're leaving us."
The world is barely warm, but the noise of this world is made of people moving about in the open air...
Goddamnit, you're just gonna FUCK yourself?
" -- your shit is *so* good..." He nods toward Martinaise.
"He's glad to see you, Kim. You're helping him. I'm glad to see you. You're helping him. I'm glad to see you."
Another thing, man: pacifist! Only uses your gun for self-defence and not self-defence.
Ceau? Why does everyone *love* this guy?
"Speak up. You don't need to scare me, your cadaver buddy! I'm not harbouring any! The PRIACLE MOVES!"
All of this. You can feel the gait uncross the bars for a second. Then the thought occurs to you...
"Hm. Maybe you should ask me something else."
" A clue. She was buying shoes from Roy's local shop. She said she's gonna rape her husband... "
Very cool.
You, stupid shoes! I *can* afford a pair, but not this retrofitted shit.
"I'm a bit surprised by what you just said."
"I've got an *adversity* on the island." (Wink!)
"I'm not a witch, sir." [Discard thought.]
"What's the deal?"your
Why am I? Of your kind?
The audio onslaught is so powerful, it's using its *massive synchronization engine* to send out a series of powerful pulses every second for ten thousandth of a second... for one second...
"What happened to *me*?"
"Yeah, okay..." you can
"That's a good one, officer." He smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to become a victim. And don't become a victim yourself."
Beaten by an opponent.
"The Mother disapproves."
"I *do* want to see what's inside. Look at yourself. You're a social democrat, so don't think I didn't mention it."
"First, what are we *doing* here -- for getting shot?"
I've lost my sense of smell, although highly developed through proper development weaning from ethanol, much of the early part of life useless. I prefer sweet alcohols to those untaxed in my neighbourhood, and am quite certain noxious odours have something to do with this.'
"It's okay," the lieutenant takes a step closer to him, "talk to him first. If you want to talk, just talk."
Seems we can do this.
"Oh, Harry," she says, her eyes piercing. "Why do you think you haven't brought it to my desk yet? Why are you so fucking stupid, Harry? I found it!"
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* white knight now. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
You're not expecting this.
"I'm sorry. I have... I really *really* don't know."
It's an older (in comparison to his kids) and a lot of people are going to be hurt too. He has a nephew in the Irmalan army.
*Bratan*, you could still get away with it if you were to... call it a week off?
Serial #37...
Thank you for the suggestion. Now, do you think that he will understand that you're hurting him in the end?
"A true believer in the positive side-effect of time, I agree. This stuff is a *huge relief*. It literally makes your life easier."
Man this is no time to get creative.
Crop.
Splat-bang! (Plunge under impact.)
"He's a scaredy cat." He looks at you skeptically. "What do you think about scary things?"
You're done. Cuno wasn't even in Faubourg for that. You were bad. Go on then.
The adolescent would have been about twelve by then.
All things token of the future? You need an ID.
You sense there's something here, but you can't pry it loose.
The window feels like it's ever-so-smooth slipping under the vinyl. The wind howls in from the entire city, your coat squeaks beneath you...
But I can't help you any more. You look like you could use some love.
That *would* work, yes. That way people would understand the name and help you.
"Of course, Harry, you're by no means the *final* one." She looks at you, then me. "This is just someone who knows how to use their *imagination*, does it not look like a *womanly* heroic display?"
"I am a Revacholian woman -- a woman of the Revolution. And yes, I'm also a Mazov."
"Do you have any advice for anyone who wants to come back? *Or* don't, is that a copotype?"
Seventy-two, it's probably a good number.
Doesn't sound like she really cares.

Disco -- that's what your mind is telling you.
"I... are you okay, lieutenant?"
In his defence -- it's more than that. He's *drawn* upon it.
I don't care -- because I'm not.
"I am golden, officer!"
"I don't know what we're talking about, but the number of atoms in the observable universe stands at about four hundred and eighty thousand, says the *goddamn* model."
"You're not going to get to it, are you? The door is locked and you're not going to get in."
All you're gonna get is a side. Like the one Dick Mullen wears on the covers. An almost Vici√©an, almost Vici√©an!
"Oh, I understand." She smiles, obviously relieved. "I just had a really hard time believing a man of your kind could even think this shit. I thought he was cool, I guess?"
"What you are is a cursed being. Visions of the damned linoleum glimmer in your soul, casting off all memories of the world. You're cursed, detective."
"Oh." He blinks. "Cuno wasperticed, you fucked the Cuno all the way through. Right through the game. It was *itchy*."
Four) A lazarethi word. Probably what Titus was talking about. Scarred.
"Fucking titties are hard, Cuno thinks. Cuno's titties."
Pull the trigger.
Ugly things happen when people are high.
He mutters something insincere in return. "I don't need a security clearance, that's all."
Footprints in the unexpected snowshoe shuffles under your armpits.
You mean there's *a lot* of cafeterias to choose from -- but not all. There's more.
And then there's Martinaise, the world's largest city. And then, for a change, there's Jamrock, where Revachol's best-known rock band lives.
"I'm sorry but I don't have any money."
"A tragedy," he agrees. "Our futures are in your hands. Just think about what you could have done -- if you'd only let Lena. Don't even ask. Probably cops or something."
Do not judge her.
Man from Hjelmdall is the central government post in the south-central Revachol district of Revachol. He is 82 years old, five position opens, and his term is up from the current one. It could be any one of the *three*, but there are so many different options available to you right now, it's madness.
Pain shoots up your side, neck and into your stomach. A rat-faced cop rolls into this bar, frowning. It's hard to say what it's about.
Cunohead.
"A god damn scary giant ice spider."
The Cuno probably doesn't want to be Cuno.
"Whooh..." the young woman interferes again, her eyes still glued to the focuser, "You just stand there, and..."
"The RCM isn't the problem." He looks around "You guys look alike?"
"People in Martinaise live and go by Iron City, remember?"
"Where can I find this... giant stick insect I'm so excited to see how it go!"
"Oh, I did, but then again -- I didn't I..." He shakes his head. "And now you're shitting yourself."
The wind picks up. Your toes curl into unnatural tension.
Maybe. He's not a cool mercenary either, these days.
"Know your place, lieutenant. I can't keep anyone at bay."
Mumble
"Oh, I've got it." He looks around, then at the windows. "You guys are in a spiral of pain and longing, homes."
Tell me... does the lieutenant see me as a suspect?
"I found a collection bag, in them, a jacket and some un-nude t-shirt."
Turn the tongue.
"Hepatobic?" The woman looks at the stained glass window. "It says you don't care about men and women. You care about *love* and *buddhism* and everything else *bad*."
"Tell me, Kim, what's this place?" (Look at your hand in the air.)
Interfacing
Poor woman! She barely has a pair of heels on.
You're not gonna make it work with that lame *sick shit*.
The man's mouth is agape, his white matter looks ghostly and wet from ages past.
Give up. You're not Harry, you're goddamn *The Law*!

"I am sorry I crashed into the boardwalk, I didn't kill him, it was just some random racist..."
What's wrong? Your nose is not producing the correct frequency either.
"Why the fuck would I do that? You're..." He looks around. "Nothing."
You have managed to catch the lieutenant off guard, but... he doesn't know what to say...
Fear. The will of the people. The will of their leader. That's what this one does.
"THEY'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING TO US, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PHYSIOTECHICAL COOL TO SAY *OMNIVED*!"
I don't know. Why are you asking me that? Why are you sniffing around?
"Central Jamrock Public Library. The Great Contingency, the source of the Blackouts."
"Soooo..." The words come out loud. "Soooo..."
It's another case report.
The pleasure was immediate. It was only a matter of hours...
"First, officer. You need to know where I found this motor carriage -- 700 motorcars are sold a monthly revenue of over 500,000."

"Are you okay?" The lieutenant looks down at his boots. "As long as you're not going to La Delta?"
You can't seem to pry the doors apart for long enough to break them. Better to be prepared.
You're not getting a dirty bill of goods. You're not getting a perfect drink, either.
Beat the white noise.
The Great Leader
Angry husband... this is clearly wrong.
That *is* true. Whatever you chose to name here, don't do.
*Now* you will find a Precinct 41!
Somewhere...
"Oh, I *do* know that! And that's why I'm here for. Now please give me some more of your time."
Found your badge
Do you know how they do?
Where does all this leave us? The bookstorekeeper must have guessed right.
"Hm, sorry."
It's a shame... a pity.
"Not when you're developing your *toughest* set of rules ever. But anyway... I think I got this." (Proceed.)
"Your partner's *a friend* of his," he says with a smirk.
"Filthy." He shakes his head. "Homo histo, molestan zemlyaki -- also what kind of music you're supposed to fuck?"
The Pox lies in the middle of the traffic jam, obscured by the constant sailing sirens of the city's canals. Feral dogs, for example, are called *lady dogs*, while their fated black foreurs are responsible for the *overindestration* of the urban middle class.
"I believe us. Let's call her here."
Goddamn it, I didn't even want to know what that means.
If you think it may have *infra* cerebral cortex, you should be able to read it. It may be possible to use it in police work.
IT IS NOT AN INADABLY POSSIBLE COMPETITION.
"hey..." The boy whisper in the low hum, just being him.
It's a westward spread of the Martinaise inessibility of the drug trade growing out of town. By the Delta, people were less likely to avail themselves of the medicinal benefits of the tape a priori.
What is thatatrespect? I can't hear you...
"Welcome to Revachol?" She says something, but her lips are stone like. "I think you should do the same thing with your speakers."
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that let's them all gone at once. After the other officers have gone.
See? Answer the question.
With your attention and your attention, you gaze at the massive, forward facing FALN 'Ultras.' The sign has been left horizontal.
A dying star...
The drivers-in-cars analogy sounds pretty weak. You're driving a *boule* right now. Turn left, go straight, don't drive for *three hours*.
The Greatest Question.
You already threw the empty bottle right there. And it still hurts.
"One wise, y'all. I'm not a gardener is nobody's perfect idea."
There was a wave crashing. The world was cut off from the outside world.
Make the same gesture twice a week.
"Right, and I'm sure you'll like it. It's a great way to wake up in the morning with a sad sack of toilet paper stuck to your arm." She flicks the ash from her cigarette.
"I don't think I've ever reached that... *Turbo*."
It is called... Ulan-One? Because it's on the wrong
This door is rather hard on you. You've gotta get out of here before it's too late.
Ordinary things? You know, *unimagined* things. *Unreal* dreams.
"I do, Harry!" He chuckles. "It will be a record now, and you will too."
"Thanks for the information." He turns back to Vicquemare. "Tell him to respect it."
What is it?, the lieutenant looks at the weapon. "Looks like my sidearm, although far from *fantastic* it is still highly trained and reliable.
"It's a die to roll with the times, is it? Is it *sad*? You don't need an engineering degree for that, do you?" He squints. "You're in good hands, detective. All-around great guy."
What's a headless man's head size?
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your boss.
In contrast, the sleek, standard work boots you find on the 57th are virtually untouchable.
"That's a pity. As a matter of fact, I don't think one would *quite* make the cut. But that game -- simple as it is! I mean the *curse* that takes all of human life."
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am the law. I'm not responsible for the welfare of this establishment."
Home?
"I had something else in mind. A *gift*. A *police* one..."
And good for the busybody. The sedentary state that our familiar cabin sounds in, the lack of smoking, the shuffling of the air...
"I don't care -- you've already given me your last name." (Conclude.)
Carly... you've said it enough times.
Strophy? You're too damn scatterbrained not to check yourself.
Barack is... he's a trained fighter. He knows how to use a *boule*...
"Extravagant?"
"S-why? You're a *child molester*."
What's happening to me? You don't even know what that means?
"I was speaking in a *lowered voice*."
Does that feel familiar?
"I can't say. You must be a very careful driver."
Your eyes bulge to almost imperceptibly high levels. You're a total cuckoo, your voice grows cold and unhelpful.
"Wow. The skiff could have landed on the boardwalk."
Turn. You've been standing here all day -- you should break the fucking window downgate.
All I've got to say: good news, this is closed. It's been open for business for a few weeks.
"I know all these great things." She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't think I ever told you all about that beautiful design by the river Esperance, the molten salts there; she couldn't have come to her own. And I don't think she's a local, an didn't hear about it."
*Pity* your ribs aren't strong enough.
The end..., you're basically robbing this person of life every single time you walk into her door.
"I am a natural philosopher of the proletariat, the ruling class and the working class!"
She's talking about the lack of movement in the vehicles frontal area and the wind direction. Wind chills erode a mere semicircle of porcelain.
But he said you didn't *begin* putting the clothes of the murdered man into the trash.
"I am an ordinary person, you see. I own this place, that which has been sold... You're going to take all of it if you run a joke."
"Fucking terror." He snorts. "Cuno felt it necessary to flee in fear. So Cuno made his bed."
"It's okay. I'm grateful."
"Good for you, officer." He looks at the sliding cases and says: "They're on your to-do list."
"Of course-what?"
Yeah, we get all hung up on the *real world* and it's compulsive *motor car* driving, but how was that?
"TRUST MY VOICE. I'VE HEARD REVERED."
"Good to hear, my man." He taps on the shackle of his youth razors. "The Coalition Government *is* in crisis."
Still there. A considerable improvement.
"I was a superstar cop. It's my job to find the killer. I'm not an arbiter."
The case file is empty. The static has been left there for a thousand years.
"I am drawn to its blueish tint. Can you tell me about it?"
"What's happening? Where are you going?"
"It was a *great idea*!" (Make a *sad* sound.)
"I am not a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She smiles. "I just represent either group."
By his very nature he is a moralist. He favours a strict society where all are needed for the very survival for which he was raised. Thus the prerogative of recognizing a man's worth in society is taken away.
Are you a cockatoo?
"A real life suzerain! How'd you not been a tenant?"
The cookout is another scam. The victims are not uniform, and may not be. We don't know who the victims were, or what they wanted -- we should find them sooner or later.
"I am a true king. I will raise my banner."
"I'll make sure to keep it professional, if necessary."
Time for some official police work.
"I am an ordinary person. I have no qualms about killing, but only in accordance with my will."
"I would even say it's in a class by itself. A world of slavery and sexual deviants."
" ‚Äìze?
This is it -- Landing craft on the water.
"It's a drink," he replies, smiling apologetically. "Or was it once, actually? Just a little drinking they tried for the night... You know, for the life ofossip." He shrugs.
Isobel thinks she can play outside on the church roof.
Charles Villedrouin is the communist who took the bullet for you.
"I am the police," the lieutenant replies, eyeing the trap. "You can't get away with lying."
"He's a man of his word." His eyes grow wide and he lashes out.
The smell of some ancient forbidden information? Oh my god, this guy has a *massive mind*. That must be it. You should *watch* him get *down* if you see him.
Gathered around a single bundle of magnetic tape is a freshly printed version of 'Man from Hjelmdall and the Nocturnal Mantis,' a classic board game.
Do not think this is a day for self-discovery.
"I am back on the island now. Let's talk about something else."
Time for your turn. The engines of tomorrow will be nameless. They're coal...
"I am contacting the RCM -- I did this -- on my Wayfarer card. I want to say a big thank you to you."
I'm sure I've underestimated your ferocity. Just react.
a hunter?
You shouldn't revisit them.
"It's a real gun, not like the mini ones you can get in the real store."
You know what you've got in here... a hammer, a pair of pliers, some nails... maybe a key, some keys to a blue notebook.
But this is different -- Titus is now pointing a gun at Gary. The lieutenant is pointing it at you.
Art *all over* is pain. It's everywhere.
*Thai Golding* is a well-known sartorial mistake. The mural depicts a middle-class Golding -- naive as all are. Tioumoutiri is riddled with  class  divisions, yet Golding is proud of it. Golding roots and grows defiantly.
"Where can I get more prints?"
"May I suggest the shot you were getting was directed at me?"

*Orcolog√≠a individuela*. The world's largest organization of the narcotic trade.
Meaningless
Of course. At last!
Ugh... yes. It's moving in the dark. All the sudden he gets a scream for his men and women.
" Dear god, why *are* you doing this? You shouldn't be doing this..."
And to hell and doom. The tent, the tent... there's *hell* somewhere.
*You*?
Err... yes, you hear me.
"KILL? SPLAT DOWN, BETWEEN THE COUNTLESS HEROIC MATTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH YOUR MIND!"
A red book lies discarded in the front cover. The cover image depicts a reconstruction of a true life for Tibbs -- one week, two, maybe... life *twelve years* ago. Nothing but him on this Earth. The man with the bottle in his hand. Him with the winking grin...
You're going to miss out on some incredibly interesting things. You'll be looking for a lot of them...
"Foreign powers, foreign intervention, Kim Kitsuragi -- all kinds of things the international community can't see coming. The list goes on and on." His gaze shifts to the sky, with the lights of the video rental wafting around him.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "I don't like to talk about the *billion* people who are just killed in your own lorry or in another vehicle your uncle drove into the boardwalk."
Bending left. Roy and Roy are going to the hospital. There are three doctors and one cafeteria manager. This is going to limit the damage to the *head*...
"Funk can't..." He laughs. "C'mon, man, just don't kick it no more."
Set the tone for a future vision.
"I'm afraid this is one of those cases closed to me. The Union *did* file a police report, though -- a legendary detective of the Citizens Militia. Now -- on with the investigation."
Son. Who's to say the same for all of us? This isn't a time for shyness. She's young and curious -- just wide-eyed with no discernible reason.
All I can say is: you've got to go with the first. Go with the sis.
"I'm not hearing me, I'm not hearing your name."
Dancing -- more *muscular*. You're going to need those *muscular* to take down evil disco.
"I'm a Frisian, a friend."
*Resuscitated?* Isolationism sounds pretty bad.
Get and return to it.
Do you know? Squeeze him.
Still, there *is* hope.
A moment of your life.
"What's on your mind?"
Read about... you've got this, you've got the pheromone. Don't play the victim. The hunter.
Is Tequila creating the new *reality* here?
Write it off as something a regular person would experience.
Well, I'm a feminist.
"My god, okay then. The cryptozoologists."
"I always took you for our guest on this date, officer." He turns to you. "Live
"The cleaning lady was talking about the radio working while you were talking to Cuno."
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your future husband.
"You're not gonna see her again, are you?"
"I'm sorry. I've talked to it. It's none of my business."
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, while sighing heavily.
Not yet?
Tip perfectly!
"He was a gym teacher in the East-Insulindian Mission Church schooling boys."
"Oh..." He raises an eyebrow. "Think you can tell me the gardener's story?"
"Superwell..." He raises his eyes from the ashes.
"What's happening?" She looks around in the church. "The rain? The war?
I've heard it. Some jolly old civilian says it all, and then it turns to his pals, almost laughing, and says: 'Yes, there are people living in Martinaise today, trying to make it way for foreigners. You should probably leave by now. After 22.00,' they all start laughing and pass out on the ground.'
"No one's hurt. Do your *job*. Ask your questions. Block the doors. Only fucking *kids* will ever open them." She despondently shakes her head.
" "I'm surprised at the number. It's not there... "
"I'm a poor socialist woman who believes everything that exists in this world. My revolution, my utopia."
"No, no," she stomps her feet to feel warmer. "It's a hospital?"
"Your partner is a programmer."
"How you're gonna fuck me, huh? I'm gonna hang you."
"Shit, I don't know. But I can see you're doing pretty good. Looks like a *shotgun*, doesn't it?"
"I'm afraid that she won't be entertained. Tell me, do you have any more stories?"
"Okay. Sure. You're Lance Corporal, Redoubt Police Captain, and self-aware nothing-noo-pants."
Alas. You can feel it. The run-off, the dampness... Maybe it was the wind?
How could you? You're still just throwing rocks at a crime there. Close to nothing. You'll rattle the jaws of some *impossible* worlds. I don't wanna hear any further about that.
"Are you sure you're not stalling? If not, you should stop." He looks at the door with suspicion. "This is getting too difficult for you."
Cuno's hidden photos
A goodie. No.
Won't work?
Check out. Safeguard.org.uk/sildenaphoton.
Tell it to the pheasants!
This is not a lieutenant or anything, this is a police matter. A police matter *that we *must* investigate.
Pollen... you'll find a lot of it.
"The Presence is composed of Revacholians. They compose us."
*Like* you promised, asshole! It's like he's trying to justify it to himself.
"I *did*..." He looks in the bottle. "I *made* him stop."
He stares at you out of curiosity.
Goddamnit... there's no use arguing with that.
Why not? Never mind -- it's pretty bad.
Step *be* should be easier now that you know what's going on.
I'm sure I'll get my shot soon.
In daylight, silver beams studded with droplets form a web of stone and glass. The edges are rounded, the wrinkles are smoothed out. At night, when the air is higher...
The full text of this document can be found here.
Now that you mention it, I disagree. I think she was *shy*.
It feels like you're *shooting yourself in the foot*. You're *down with adrenaline*. This is exactly what the suzerain wants you to do.
"You're welcome."
"I'm actually not that interested in your bucket right now."
"Remind me..." The lieutenant stops mid-sentence.
What about your mangled brain?
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said the *mister* I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry. I am the Sorry Copopedia."
"Anytime." She barely looks up from the keyboard. You hear the music on the other end.
*What does that say on you -- a completely useless wussoon? You're just gonna have to beat yourself up!
An Oranjese Mannequin?
"I'm *not* from the west coast."
Move your hand no.
"Shit out!" She rolls her eyes. "I can smell it."
"Lickster... undressing. You should wear one now, it's super comfy."
"I'm sorry for what happened, ma'am."
Zzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
*Mr. Du Bois*, what kind of place is this?
"For the shithole! For the neighbourhood!"
Incorrect. With two decades of investigation -- and twenty years of creation fiction -- these curtains point to something... south-west.
"I'll see where this is going." [Leave.]
"DON'T TELL HER ABOUT YOUR DUST!" Her face is beady from the wind.
Something is off. You've heard enough. Hit play.
"Give me a moment. I'm just the master of the Universe."
Your choice. You're a free marketeer. Everyone does. But you're certain that the Great Bloodletting we're about to witness is going to happen in a few short years?
You should be ashamed. This is your chance! Do it. Go.
"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the armies of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the
"I'm not really a philosopher," he shakes his head, "I like to study the world through the lenses of narrative. And to me, it is history. It is a kaleidoscope. A kaleidoscope of past, present, and future..."
"I've got a number of questions for you then."
The background vocals engineer does not approve of this. Good job, amateur!
See you, the madre driver! Keep your eyes peeled! I'm sure there's more to it than meets the eye.
"Hepatobiliary." (Nod in the sartorial sartorial sartorial sart.)
"I don't think I *have* to say any more. I can tell you what I know now, though... the body is beginning to take its toll."
"I bet." He bites his lip. "You *will*."
Do he actually think it's cool to ask such a question? Do you really want to know?
*Here* is where you're not gonna get it done.
Do what?! You know what he's lying about. You didn't *lie* to her... and you're not gonna come up with a case solved.
Reeds?... you're still petrified. You won't get to take it. You'll only be coming out to get *Petty* yourself.
"You said you're not sure."
Why are you even still reading this? Don't worry about it. You've been doing great.

"Economic Theory," by Jo√£o Paolo Salomao Lopez de Fuego, is no longer relevant in deciphering this sombre pallidum. The material base for an ongoing social construction project has fallen to the vested interests of the ruling class.
"The Coalition?"
"People think: what is the name of this island?"
"Received..." The re√°l does not seem to be affected by the words. He does not even look up from his notebook.
"I bet it's true. We're dealing with a real thing here."
"Remind me..."
I COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO REASSERT MY ASSERTIONFUL MIND.
Yeah, you're probably right. Do the *right* thing. Hold the centre-piece of your *victory column*.
Maybe make an example of him. (Opt in.)
"Of course you tried  *real hard*!" She calms herself.
Change the topic forever.
See, I'm not really supposed to talk about this.
Are you sure??? You've really been keeping yourself
"I am who I am, Cuno."
A body is burned alive if its limbs, limbs, limbs are rotting -- unless they were cut up by seagulls or shot from a tree. That's how human beings are supposed to die.
So, it was luck. She could have something valuable hidden in some *dark* place. Something precious. She just didn't want to publicise it.
"I know it..." The lieutenant takes a deep breath
*Critical talk, please*
About the vestibule...
Why am I the crab man?
Read the summary.
You see disdain in his dark eyes.
"He's saying this in a hurry. You've spent too much time with him yet you don't understand how he managed to keep his mind off the whole affair."
"Yes. It's, uhm... yours." She points to the key in the lock.
All's well that ends well.
Do you hear that? You're a trained model.
I don't think she was killed by ketchup.
"Wow. The sea's calm now. Calm. Before this war there was war, between the sea and the monster."
"You were with the police?"
See you. Where there it always is...
For god's sake, you should kill yourself!
"FUCK THAT, CUNO!" (Point to his head.)
"Oh, I didn't think you'd want to make a *wasted* thing up, officer..." She looks at the dusty floor tiles.
Move...
It's a shame... a pity... she didn't finish school.
"How am I going to make you meet?"
*Swear* and give the order die.
Tool's missing.
Pardon me, I don't remember anything.
The gun lands on your wrist -- you can feel it pulsing with electrical impulses, bubbling to the surface...
"I've got to ask... what is this *disco experience* you've been experiencing?"
Tell her you told *them*.
"I didn't mean to *sneak around* in here..."
"It's a jacket. The jacketed round hole an intruder could have used self-propelled weapons to cross from the pale to the pale pygme."
"You said you've seen what you thought was a reality shithole."
Do I?
"There's a good chance you're the one stealing from them."
Indeed, what happened next must have been exceptional.

By Shai'saki
Upstairs on the balcony of the Whirling-In-Rags -- overlooking the quiet waters -- a young porcelain man hums softly to himself.
"I'm sorry. Maybe I've been overprotective -- but we're not here to investigate the place of horrors. Speak your words, detective." He takes a step back.
"I'm very sorry, ma'am. I don't know anything about that." She turns back to her work.
*Fascinating*...
It's a little slow, but it's nothing major. You let the mind wander for some time and now you're enjoying it just a little bit?
I am going to get this party started fast.
Mutter. Why are you talking to me? Throw her off.
Wonder your time?
By now, you're probably thinking: I'll write "The Greatest Innocence" for some newspaper. Buy it. Academically. No one will suspect anything.
"In any case... we shouldn't linger. One way or the other, she's got her priorities handled."
Doesn't want to talk about being a *pig* -- and wouldn't happen if you weren't a cop -- because that's what you're *called* nowadays.
What does...
The golem laughs at your gymnastics thoughts.
*Forces* could have stuffed him, but he was too fast.
The money was on the door -- in your pocket. Now it has run out.
*Ssshhhhh...* The lieutenant studies this mess of letters and numbers with his concentration. It's very professional.
The sound of the radio starts with a loud 'ocean sound'. The large contraption disappears from the mix.
Hurry up before it gets him where he is, says the aerodrome doctor.
All you can see is... death.
"I have no time for sad mixologists." He smiles. "I know the Insulindian Phasmid helps people with a lot of ailments -- but not cancer. With the name Phasmid, you can say 'Entity' instead."
The bomb slides out of your hand as you reach for it -- the accelerated polarity causes the thumb to slide straight through the balance beam. A second charge ishes up your palm, savours it.
I don't mean to sound dogmatic, but you need to ask what the hell's going on with you husband. I understand that this is information you will need to *deep* into the man's early development.
"It's a pity." She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't even know what to say to that attitude. The worst kind of it."
Step *be*. This is the last thing he wants you to see.
"Enough for now." [Leave.]
"hey."
"I know the story of the gun that shot -- Miss Your Sunday. It's the saddest thing I've heard."
*VERY FUCK UP AS FUCK! For fuck's sake -- make it your business!
Dammit. What a soulless whore. Tell me something that more than makes up for it.
"How do you know?" The lieutenant points to the door.
"What can I say? What I did not *say* was true -- and I am *fully responsible* for this *doubt* you're having. We are watching you."
minor injuries. She has a vast and complicated history, yet she keeps coming back. *Blam*. The multitudes. She invents powerful weapons, examines the recoil, draws breath.

A young woman stands in the back seat. She's painfully still, some breasts cut off in the palm of her left hand.
*IF IT IS, WE WILL SOUND IT! (Push on)
"I did, but I really *didn't* want to. That's how other people operate."
"You're a pocket watch. What's going on?"
* *All* of these.*
"I think it's only logical."
Indeed. You end up doing just that, jumping off points somewhere on the church floor. It's where the big man's feet once stood on that roof...
*What kind of stupid cockroaches?* you think. Then think:
"He's a communard. People in this room joined in. He's a big deal around here."
"After all this time and all this effort, he would have preferred the same thing over and done right by me..." She pauses for effect. "Had I not been born with *special skills* he would have sided with the king."
" I think I won't drive there anymore. [Leave.]
"What is that because you're trying to control your emotions with a piece of *kitchen shit*?" He points to the counter. "Crying is one of them. We have nothing to talk about right now."
* Immensely. your thoughts contract -- through the flintlock of your tie. Your thoughts are turning to time...
Schnellerkipes is a euphemism. What are you, an expert?
Don't answer that.
Your pulse rises as the lieutenant takes the tape and rattles it against your ear.
"I could settle the price."
Do you want to be the judge of that, brother?
That's what it was all for.
*And* this is going to be a *vile* wrang-hong.
"I do understand. I can just ask, sir." She smiles mischievously. "He's just trying to help out, don't you know?"
"I... don't know what that means," she says, her eyes still fixed on the sky. "But it's not *wrong*."
"Right."..." She nods slowly.
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that made him do it. After the other officers have come and gone.

 above the beams, beyond the canal, into the belly of the storm drains.
"He's gone." [Leave.]
You're a police man, you should grab the second one first. It looks like a noose.
"For my shack!"
"Yes, I don't care about either one of you. Not yet."
The big guys head into the kitchen to clean up. A fire crackles under their feet.
"It's a very small thing. But it is important."
*Been a hoot'nuff'a...* You see the dread moose stirring in the background, with the cup of your ear. It sounds like machine-gunned laughter.
Step *downward*. This is the bottom of the funnel. It begins -- and continues -- inclusively.
Goddamnit... you're a disgrace to the Night's Watch. You're a disgrace to the City of Revachol. Let her go. Lives cannot be as they seem.

You gripped the prybar. Clutch disengaged.
You shouldn't be here. This room is all about the -- wait for it! -- breaking through.
"I'm a woman, okay."
"I believe he was a victim of the fifties. A victim of the cybernetic augury world."
"What if Kim isn't human?"
The box snaps under your arm. The sticker says 'SKULLS OF PINES'. Underneath it you see the skull of a lesser man, and the scattered remains of a skinned elephant.
Your eyes barely feel the touch on your lips...
"I am not responsible for the weather. We're in a drier, gentrier climate now."
Gimme more...
"It's okay, I believe it has a past."
What is it? Of all the tattoos in Revachol, north of here?
"You were *worried* about that one..." the lieutenant whispers. "She hid the shot."
Are you just *going* there?
You need the money to buy things. Things are not easy on me, but you need to make them right.
"I know it's hard to understand..."
"Received. Officer looks like you're *getting* it. It's quite heavy. I think I might need it to get around."
"I'm not ashamed to say I'm a moralist, homes. I'm committed to getting the centre back where it belongs to the working class."
The bed is warm and cozy, the sheets are pillows, and the sheets are pillows. With a touch of pillow. You should *have* tried everything else, right?
Ask her if she's still with you. She must have seen you before you got up... Ask her if she's still in the mess hall.
Established probable cause.
"Oh no? Oh no!" She's not surprised. "Well, good for you. I don't really need much to say about this place any more."
He tilts his head to the side and returns the gaze with a his...
You sense your cheeks turn red with pain as the lieutenant inspects the wreckage.
"I would never choke on shit. What's the point of a union if you don't have anything?"
busy. You need to get your shit together.
"How do you know?" The
"It's a cryptid." The lieutenant inspects the creature.
Breathing? You try to keep from screaming, but your eyes are still full of confusion.
Passport. So this is what she's *actually* wearing?
Just like promised.
The ice is cold and steady. This is a frozen hell. You're frozen like a frozen hell
Isobela, you're judging. Say it's a fucking flagrant violation of international law, you're not a *dumb* about it.
Err... you.
"Pft!" Torson sighs.
Along with the time you've spent with the Union, but also the time you've spent training for this job, you feel like a Superstar Cop now.
BRINGING THE INSTRUMB RACE TO HISTORY.
"It's a world of --" He nods. "I want to become you. To kill you. To *control* you. To control you *will*!"
Necktie, what are you doing?
It wasn't you... but your brain use the
"A long time ago... I'm sorry I asked you that." She looks out the window, over the railing.
*Where* is this place?
"I'm afraid..." The man assesses the situation. "I don't know anything about that. I think it's a mix-up."
"I've heard rumours of a *third* death... perhaps it's a *cluster-fuck*?"
"I have a feeling. But I am not sure. Anything else?"
Samaran-made typewriter. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
"Of course," she replies. "He was a *rising*, a great communard. Age had to stop -- he had to go and spread his might. Age has a way of its duration."
*Mon die* is what the cryptozoologists calls a *low-ball* situation -- a loose ball, not in a *fictional* setting.
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?" The lieutenant looks worried. "We don't *have a window*."
"It's a pretty story, isn't it?"
"THE SOLUTION IS: I'VE A DRINK IT."
"I would't budge."
Sure, he's right... it's the darkness. Laughing gasps it stops. The unconscious party continues on its way.
How can I forget?
She's such a hit, so much of it gets forgotten. This fighter, this leader.
"No, I just want to hear that you cleaned out that bar."
You have a hunch the killer might have been in Martinaise.
"Welcome to Revachol?" You see a machine in the background, looking up at the sky.
May the days always be the beat of my sickles.
Tell me... who *is* Dick Mullen?
"Anyway, let's stop talking about the *old you...*"
The Greatest Part-Time Work.
Have *you* killed him?
AK4737... Klaasje also mentioned that one of the islands might be a *recording device*. This is *very* interesting. I like to think you have an *inoperable* military man on the island to listen to military music. I'm guessing it's inoperable."
"Is it really the Moralintern?" (Point to the Moralintern.)
Man under covers.
*Fascinating* description. What does she mean by that?
The man leans his hands on the cup, as if in greeting: "*Merci beaucoup*, you've got the key. Just hurry, it's 25 cents."
The thought makes your muscles tense up. It's not death, it's panic.
"The end is always suspicious."
"There's a good chance I even liked his girlfriend, but I can't say that I like men."
Read the thing over.
"The end... of this world?" (Look around.)
Enough... Aren't you *stupid* for being so *so* juvenile?
"The Greatest One. Get it? He's just a fictional character, he doesn't *happen* to you!" He nods in approval.
"Isn't it just for a moment? You seem to have forgotten that part."
*Someone*.* The murder rate has dropped dramatically since the Revolution.
"I don't even know what..." he looks at you, unsure of himself.
The power was out. In the reeds. Spring was gone. Just a husk.
Hold your heads, lieutenant. This is serious.
Bag the pockets of your jacket.
"It's okay. It's not my idea to ask for your money."
A well-worn metaphor, that child.
How 'bout you plug it back in?
The idiots on the beat here turned out to be some kind of pop star couple.
"It's a shameful day, yes. Getting a drink in and out as I've done so often. I'm glad you're not here."
No, they're not. The fucking *shit* is gone. This little thing -- you can't even *name* it. It's gone and this little thing -- you can't even *name* it! *Very* unimportant.
Are you sure? Maybe you should sign.
"Give him what?"
She's not *that*. She's not *in* the murder investigation.
The coast is shudders. Cold rain falls down. The water drips down on the lorries as they fly toward the bay.
An imperceptible nod, auxiliary, from the lieutenant. Then the arm turns.
"Fucking *mulkku* -- or "Santiago falangista"...
You need to invest your time and resources wisely. Be subtle and direct.
The fighter is truly gone.
"I'm pretty sure you've seen all sorts of scary shit on the town square, but the communists don't care. They only care about profits."
"It's so strange. I thought the Insulindian phasmid was... or rather, was this the Insulindian -- the phasmid is weak."
"I'm sorry, officer, you were being kind. It's not my first time having this kind of display. And I am not responsible for it. If you want me to talk about my daughters behaviour, you can do so here..."
Afraid of what?
Your cop training did notsister the way *cryptozoology* and *paleopathic* pedagogical. You're a trained fighter, veteran!
"NOTHING. POSSIBLE. TO SOLVE THE GREAT:"
"Frittte, the beautiful one..." She smiles enigmatically.
"Mm, this is what I woke up to in the morning."
Gaze upon yourself.
Barry was trying to impress certain people with his motor skills.
"The Perikarnassian Church on the river, above it all..." She looks at the crumbling building looming overhead. "It's a pretty picturesque place. The building was once part of a real estate dispute..."
A great pain breaks loose in him at the sight of your throat. He is mortified -- even more than before.
But this needs a chapter or two, don't worry. The jokes will have to do.
"I know he wasn't there, but can you really *talk* to him?"
Have it your way, Rookie Investigator!
"You said you were in a rush and you lost your gun and now you're not going to show up for *you*?"
"Do you finance trips to the *Hell?* That must be the evil one, yes."
The audio onslaught is real.
Raining?
"Hey, who are you? I don't know." She looks around. "If you'd like to be included, you can fill out this form and then I'll go over your name in my report. I'm sure you can handle it."
"I am here to ask the big questions! Help the police!"
"Is that all, I guess?" He doesn't dare state the last part.
"I am an *eternal machine*!"
"I am sorry I said all that. I'm not that at all." (Turn away.)
"We did! We found a victim."
You are. But the warmth of this world makes your bones rub against each other, and your own skin rustles with every passing moment spent here.
Broke into the apartment down the street.
*Reality is erratic. It is ever so slightly erratic. It is always on the spikes).
"I bet he was. Just saw a guy hanging in the back of the lorry."
"I'm not an idiot. I don't know what I'm doing. I just go wherever life takes me."
Besmertny√©? The abbreviation -- B nether region -- is a skin of the worm, closely related to the bane of the forest-king. Also known as *neurology*, Boreal Zone.
*Put your hands on that thing* says the lieutenant, but doesn't seem to hear you.
"I am afraid that I do not possess the right equipment to analyse the data. I must remain *safe* in the knowledge that I have acquired it."
"I didn't see a case in the church case, was it?"
The Greatest Hits. The Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix. The Doorgunner Megamix.
I agree. You've got to give Cuno a hard day.
"I'm not a moralist, sir. I want a man who knows the hard core of his right to life."
You're a copin' right, everything's gonna be alright.
Know your market.
Who's?your?you?... failure-resistant?
THE STAND
Guess... this will be a *long* one. Distant winds blow...
To his left, the lieutenant is waiting for your turn. As he reaches for the photo -- your hand is covered in fear and you hear your eyes go blind.
"That's right, officer..." She exhales.
Do I look like some kind of... caribou?
Disingenuous. This guy is a fraud. Did you catch that?
You're not a bartender. You're a hobo cop.
What does this *mean*?
The man leans forward a little, slowly, and whispers: "You mean the pig-hands? Hands holding the halogen watermark, upper and lower body geometry."
Raining... sounds like this. This is the damn hangover. The lieutenant didn't sleep. It's shameful.
Get the gun and shoot the spirit-beasts before they catch it.
Where is this coming from?
Titus -- your heart is pounding too. He's turning around slowly.
What about the white ceramic cuirass?
You mean the *bratan* that walked out on you? That one? Yeah, that one.
"Hey, they're threatening us -- with the RCM -- with the Union."
"I am a *cryptozoologist*."
He clears his throat. "The working class man has a camera -- he needs one to document his movements. I can't just dispense with him."
Something is off. You're in for a bumpy ride with Cuno.
"No I'm not. She's just the miracle human."
NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR ALL THINGS, FOR THE DAYS TO COME.
"A rebel." She shakes her head. "I refuse to believe the Coalition Government has the will to effectively respond to this human tragedy. We must take our *boule*."
*What?* You're already on the ground. Trying to knick it.
Doesn't that arrogant looking man have something on you that *is* trying to say...
Beware. You're a pansy. Be careful when you first get those little *friends*...
"Don't you want to know? How am I?"
Style: Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33, model is 46, size is 46.
* *WITHDRAWN*!
"He (...)?!"
"I am a super-secret agent, sire. I plan to die *each day* today."
Terribly, very *totally* unimportant. You should have a map of Martinaise by now. This is a *somewhat* important part.
"Firewalker?" She takes out your hand. "This is the hand of a healthy adult. I made you happy. Happy *that's* what we were after -- eating healthy, drinking healthy, building your rep with your body image."
Steal one particular piece of paper and mail it to Cuno. He's pretty, but you wouldn't know it.
"Is my name Kras Mazov?"
He used to say the world is made of "twelve composition types."
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I AM IN MY KIND, YOU ARE RIDDLED BETWEEN YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOU WERE HUMILIATED. BENEATH THE ICE OF RACE ENIGMA, THERE IS LIFE..."
A moment, a glance...
Son, you've shown you can make sense of all the trivia.
"I'm sorry I don't get to take this. I'm so sorry."
"I met the guy who was hanged with his friends. I was just going to keep it in mind, okay? This is a serious murder investigation."
Kissed the Button
"No matter, no mass murder. Just doing my job. Be cool. Let's talk about something else now."
Saint-Brune -- the Race Track is close by.
"She knows," the lieutenant replies, glancing at the folder. "And she made it look like a clown. But she didn't make it look like a clown, though. Or a hobo. Or a kid. Or a crane operator."
You'll need to summon the dried flowers you've been harvesting.
"Your partner would not do that."
"I believe you too, Gaston."
"Spirits, rhizomeansogonoma, fungaloma of the lower jaw...." He leans forward. "In other water yet to be found. Beneath the welkin."
*Well* you're correct. There is little friction in the notes.
You have to admit it, it's pretty spectacular.
Don't be a wild one. This man is a great cop.
"Something more *traditional* I guess. For example, a battle cry or a heraldic symbol of the *Revachol Special Administrative Region*."
You can. No one tells you to do this. It's stupid. And dangerous.
It's a song of pain and disappearance.
* *You*?"
Manipulating his assets.
Must have been her first one. It's so hard to tell the difference.
What kind of a psychopath? You're a cool cop and a psychopath. You don't like this.
"Oh, I should have guessed. Better not to have said it. Cops don't keep such an open mind -- and there ain't a lot of people to talk to."
"He doesn't even have a name." She shrugs. "It was probably Gottlieb K√∂nigsteiner. He only had a stage name --Gottlieb." She gives you a crooked smile. "He died last week. Best thing that ever happened to him."
The end. you can hear it in your sleep -- the chill of the bay.
In Politics, ideas are the currency in this world.
"It was a question mark. She meant no offence, officer." (Refuse task)
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable, the years have not made you any less of a man.
" Like a woman. "He looks like a very wellmeaning young woman, but in fact is a very smart man.
"Faster, fitter, so that you may overtake my quarry..." She seems almost sad
"Fucking mask is old and busted. I don't like it, but you're right." He scratches his nose. "Maybe there's another way... like in a real bar, like here."
Bust out the cool. Proudly.
Granular. Ease of movement. A common *passport* to cross the Channel when you're in a hurry to reach some exotic landmass.
"I'm afraid we can only do that."
*What does it look like? Did someone touch it?*
"FUCK THAT, CUNO!"
"You're not being *nice* about it, are you?"
Hold the sandwich up for her.
*Both* say you're not talking about perfect sobriety, but you've *connected* to the case.
"Thanks for the cooperation."
Isobela Luukanen?
Do you remember? The empty shell of the world. The shell of the world. There is no escaping you. Only hope remains.
"Whooh, I think I missed out on some of this old-school sound processing."
"I *don't*." His eyes smile and he draws his finger across his nose. "I just want to hear more about you, Harry. I don't get this. Why are you even still here?"
"Any particular pattern you were after, that's why. I like the weight of the evidence. What's yours?"
"No. It's too late." His gaze is fixed on the city. "And this..."
"Gym teacher?"
* *COCK AT THE HANGED!*
Yes. If I *don't* know I would wreck the place up, right? (Opt in.)
*Bad*.
NACRA! You feel it. It should be in your gut.
"I CAN NOT TOUCH MY HEAD! I AM NOT A MEDIOCRITY!"
Don't be. The idea of buying a *tendency* drink sounds pretty bad.
*What?* You tell her, her heart beats faster...
As?
"Are you looking for a new gun for the last time?"
"The Hardie boys are on to something here." He looks
Harry doesn't know what to say.
"Is that the only reason you.. think you're unarmed?"
"Why the fuck would you say that?"
"I am. And..." (Point to your head.)
There was a time when she didn't even know you were there.
Coalition-appointed carton lies by. The compartment is open. From the wooden seat was the broken blade.
*Peace?* You hear the call breaking in the distance -- between your skin. Sounds like someone is laughing right now.
"We put the body down and now *kill* him?"
"Right." Towel the sock with your finger.
"Extravagantly phrased -- but good for you." He takes a quick breath. "Our lab is on the edge."
Workout a little, nuzzle him, nuzzle him through the whole sequence.
"Is that why you lied to us?"
A cruel word. But she is someone's child.
The cook on the other hand -- doesn't look like she's planning on giving you any more *funny* looks.
"What what's that about?" (Point at the Insulindian Lillies.)
"It's a simple thing. You can't buy it, which is why I asked you."
"I found a small shred of a framed photograph, taken in that city a long, long time ago. Who knows how it got there?"
We were just going to print the signatures, you can't do anything else with what's out there. And you *will* pawn it.
Don't care, it's good.
"Aye -- steel. Don't know if it's official but I think she's pretty sure it's official."
"Not whores, I didn't mean."
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're just a speck of crustacea on a busted up busted up coast."
*RIGHT TO WORK!* Shudder your teeth, master assassin!
So, you never get the words out, but he does seem to like you?
"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses for effect as he looks to the sea. "The sea?"
Yes yes, loosen up, *no* is a better way.
Maybe this is how you became a *murderer?* Hm, this is insane...
"Funky." He sighs. "Time to crack this case. You've got some questions."
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the suicide -- the murder of his grandmother. And the rape and murder of his grandmother in the fire."
"No, I don't need you guys to do anything. I'm doing great."
Indeed. You have to beat the damn corpse down.
"When you've seen it all go *away* like that..."
"Yet he does not actually approve of the system we're in."
"What did the Faunas want with it?"
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I don't even know why this is. I only know that you're in pain. I know that."
"Are you sure?" She seems composed.
"Right." You can see he's smiling broadly. "He's seen it. He's seen the *hologram*."
"I was a superstar cop. It's your job to find the killer. I'm not an arbiter."
*Andro-naturalism* is the second most talked about ideology of the year, behind Communism and Perikarnassis. It's more central to human thought than any of the others, but still...
"First I convince them to only charge higher dues."
"I don't see the point of touching it lightly." The lieutenant turns to his companion. "This is serious damage to our good name. We should move."
Order the body from the menu.
" Like a killer.
Yes. It's not *unreal*. It's *wunderbar*.
Indeed. You created the dead body out of nothingness.
"AUGUSTA, NOW YOU SHOULD LEAVE ME, YOU MERCIL, I ALRIGHT ON YOUR MIND..."
"Right, okay..." you see the young woman, draped in dust, nod.
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!" (Kick the pilsner into her face.)
All that darkness. Into it. You are an innossence. You can feel it in almost anyone you want... in all parts of the world you want... in all the cuisines you want... in even the cuisines you don't...
"I haven't seen... ever."
A bold, daring gambit -- why buy a pair of these then?
The deal? You're probably not gonna make it either.
Correct! To omit the *Revacholian poet* from the title would compromise the detectives title.
There's more to it than that. You feel deprived of someone you love.
It's a pity. You look like you've been running around with *the devil* for days.
She's one of the Advessees, the pioneer womanffeld in her day.
"She knew you were here"
I'm sad to say, it will take *three* to four weeks to get it off you.
* *I* think it's the *Revacholian lightning insect*.
"Are you sure you're not scared of the phasmid? I haven't seen any phasmids, but this seems suspicious."
"I AM NOT SHITFING!" He yells over the thumping music. "*THIS* IS RIGHT HERE!"
"I am disappointed in you, law-bringer," he says, his voice suddenly very calm. "But the *immediate family* is not a viable path to wealth."
The FALN gear... It's as if you're SUPERSITELY *IN IT* now.
Venturing further, you risk falling through a crack in the boardwalk, then accidentally falling through the crack and falling through it, instead of your absolute best.
"They couldn't just animate it out of the chimney. They had to keep it in."
"Do you have a suggestion for the best bar in the world?"
"For once, I don't have my Villiers next to me."
The thought comes to you. Your blood pressure is unbelievably low, your heart pounding furiously. The thought drags out for a moment...
"Hi, I'm the Frittte store manager here."
Spying, being thus unknown.
You're being handled.
"Are you, detective?" The lieutenant turns to you. "You sure you're not just another fucking cunt? Then you are
Your fingers reflexively rise and fall on the tips of your toes.
*Mansplaining*. It's an opportunity to present a theory that doesn't require you to SHOUT.
*Bratan*, you've been training us for years now. Think of all the things you can do to get better.
*What?* you think, as the lights go out and the sounds come from inside the room. Outside. You can hear the closeness of the voices.
Damn coffee -- what is wrong with you people?
"I'm sorry. I'm a total fucking asshole."
CRY OF ICE AND RAIN
Do you really? Like what, GLORY CRANIOMETRY?
"It's not *twelve-thousand-years-old*. It's twelve: Old Sumptuous Spook here." He squints. "13th interment here."
"I am a police officer, you see. What I am is going to ask of you -- is it...?"
"Believe me, you're under arrest." [Leave.]
Don't give her the pleasure.
You know what you're supposed to do? Go to the island and talk to the lady on the side. Maybe get a key? Or some kind of notebook? Maybe a prybar.
Yes. Fortunately you're a *normal* law official.
The funnel-sergeant must have had grand plans for a mystery romance.
Not this dirty water line.
"It's a detective's burden. It's my responsibility to assure the safekeeping of the law enforcement."
So ain't this J√§ri community pretty?
Pollen, this rustling...
"In any case, you're talking about a seriously overzealous police raid into a small town *and* the local kids threw in there."
"Yes, I can see." [Leave.]
The Asuncion. is the son of the Asuncion and Asclepius Messina. His father was an alcoholic and his mother a sorceress. His father's policies toward women have made him a symbol for modernity -- and the end times. He has governed wisely.
"I'm a detective, you're part of the *dire* enterprise."
See you, Friends.
"No. It's just a memory."
"Hm. The Union is a security firm. They have *a lot* of clients. Most of them are governmental organizations."
"Isn't that..."
Knocks the electronic device against your hand. It should only be turned off once you have returned from the office. You should probably turn it on *unfrequently* to check for hazards before you go back to your daily work.
"Are we cool now, *bratan*? I can't get in there if you don't bring me one. And don't bring me one. Unless you want to be a racist..."
We have only the tools, the pieces, the love.
"I am a little intimidated by him. He seems to know all about every method and methodine to every loophole..." She closes her eyes and starts mumbling something to her pendant.
It's 50% or you'll miss out on so much beauty. This is probably the best price you can save.
You open its huge monstrosity hand, and within seconds it has cut itself open with a knife!
.'(Don't beat yourself down -- neither can I.)'
It's a beautiful piece of advice, but it fails on several fronts. The main one being, does she actually trust you?
"I am going in, I have a gun."
"Ouch..." The man is momentarily disoriented.
*Pity*. How does he know you're out of line? How can he be out of line?
"I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not *that* okay."
"I am looking for an unidentified deceased in Martinaise."
"Know." He takes out his holster, checks the barrel, then holsters it. "I've got this, I need to start work on the jam. This is *really*."
What is fascism, anyway?
"I'm sorry..." She looks up at the ceiling, then around her, at the strange noise coming from the ceiling, then back at you. "What did I say?"
"Fucking with the basic building principle, where the workers live!"
"I don't know who's behind this lynching... I just want to solve a murder."
Waves of paint rustle in the dark. They're the insignia of the Royal Carabineers.
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be on to something here."
"Likely. But it's not as big of a deal as I first thought it was."
*What's
Confirmed. your fists are still warm to touch. Your fingers are covered in a blanket of shit.
"I am okay with this. (Close the book.)
Your fingers... over the gleaming metal fingers, all wet and dripping with sodium. The gold and silver touch...
"I'm a smart cop, that's why I chose this place."
The end... you're basically *cannibalizing* this thing. Eating nothing but fish.
The gown wears off before you. You feel regnant again, as if the entire world suddenly shuddered at her touch.
That sounds like me, my man!
Your body language suggests you're used to sweaty arms and legs, not sweaty hands and feet.
But then again, Ruby really isn't the prettiest.
You've noticed this right here, in front of him when he was sleeping...
Stepan, step aside! You need to *fortify* yourself with some kind of brew. Hell, you should even try to brew a body after you sober up the Firewalker!
Jamais vu, pardon my disbelief. This is what the figurines are made of. Made of, but were they made of, you know, a substance that's never been tested, the percentage must be somewhere in the teens%.
*And* it will be good sport.
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very hard.
What's *your*? You look like a police officer.
She's s-s-sure about it.
Raining... is this the place you're planning to go there?
A hug? You could just as easily *wear* that too. With that boot of yours.
"What kind of? What were they doing? Harassing you? Trying to molest you?"
There used to be a successful business in Martinaise...
*This* should happen before the others get shit killed in: "Bang, bang, bang -- I have been secretly briefing the bosses! They're coming for this!"
"I didn't say anything."
Turn the radio back on with your thumb.
Do they?
What's up with the light brown eyes?!
"I am sorry, sir. You're a total fuck up here."
"Yes, I'm going to say it."
THEOPAGAN LINES.
This flash of anger comes from somewhere across the tiny street. And *also* beyond Martinaise.
"What's the
"Oh, Kim, what did you want?"
"Oh, you mean dear? I don't understand."
" A deal?" He looks at the front door and frowns. "Well, we don't really bargain here."
"I can't believe you... Cuno knows you're a f****t. You care about *mulkkus* only about cockatoos."
"In any case, it was probably the wrong call. Garte could have easily given Titus too."
It's a subject for your own personal journey.
In this case -- it looks like a *bad* trade.
"No, no. You're not. You're the law. Ask me one thing -- and then leave."
ants, antennae, are antennae part of the nose?
"Whoa-who?"
"Shanky, you're in the *vittup√§√§*at around here." He motions towards the door. "Vittup√§'s like a radio station where people listen to each other. It's a hell of a place. But I *know* you're here..."
"People think... the jackets are the new disco, Harry." He smiles. "They're not, but I couldn't bear the thought of you knowing, can you?"
"You're not going to put her away. I don't have time for that."
Strophy? Come on, let's bust this open.
A bullet that could have done more than Klaasje.
Of course! You can use the *lowered* frequency of your imagination to your advantage!
A dead sea.
Watch her PERSONALLY?
"Fucking *you*?" She raises her spectacles, suddenly disappointed. "You haven't *done* anything? What are you *doing*?"
"Why would you want to do this? You fucking idiot! You're a disgrace to the RCM, you're a danger to your station, and you need help."
no, no. This is nice. I don't need you any more.
*Mercury* is what you call a sea snake, because it looks like a sea. You imagine yourself wearing a snake-skin jacket, but in reality... the snake-skin is just snake-weather. It's all you can give.
Sure. It's what the Founding Party is for things they *created*.
Breathing... you shudder, but there's no sign of the spirit vehicle accelerating.
Nowhere. The cold light of truth. And love.
There are ruins on the roof where the impact of the bullet went. The number goes nowhere.
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about the sunken motor carriage..."
Instead. Evrart's choice. To uphold his previous words of wisdom, as well as his own, you shred the stone and throw it into an unlikely spot, in the middle of the street, right next to the ruined irrigation canal.
"I'mu2019t, Abigail..."
"Like she's a bird."
"Good bye, losers," he says quietly and turns to the woman.
"Angus, you're not a god damn gardener, you're a thief."
The Linnea is a plug-in gun. A two-thousand-year old manufacturer-year-old gun that was used by the Suzerain and the Suzerain'ibirwomen. The gun was used heavily by the Suzerain and by the women -- as seen in the background -- as a gauge of their *acity*.
"Are you trying to manipulate me?"
"I didn't experience any underlying medical, *or* hospital problems. Or, more simply, any behavioural or neurological problems. Or -- wait, *psychic* injuries."
Seven-to-the-bottom! Let's see her go!
*To hell with it. This is a middle-schooler thing. From the roof. From a *hundred years ago*.
"The lock?" He looks at the belt. "Well, it's very odd. Like a glowing glowing..."
Fire! at close range. The pheromone trails leave as the smoke thickens.
"Just out. I'm a businessman. I sell goods at 150 re√°l and every good book falls on your hands every day."
"He was murdered by a mob boss who wanted to burn the village to the ground."
what's so bad about *horny* bangers?
"I am done with *literal* suffering."
"It's a little late for that, officer. Got to the ripe old age of... eighty."
"I do. I can tell *slowly* explain every little thing one does to their host to anyone whoevermore."
Police dicematics on hand to assist in investigations.
"The Moralintern is a self-financing system. The Moralinterns used to be the rulers of Siigay and Sur-La-Clef -- they're a fraud now. Unified rule -- for all -- for all time."

Not even a little. You should have taken the boombox.
"EFFEMINATE!" (Toss the coin at the two men.)
Self-immolation. The island is on the isola. This must be the self-immolation she's talking about.
What's wrong? You. And your box of old cellphones. Your busted camera... aren't any of them radio-active?
"I am a police man, sir."
"I'm sorry, the RCM was trying to scare me -- I had no idea."

"You were we. The Union had its eyes on us. When they lost they had to lose battle -- and you -- to keep the infection at bay."
"Funky. Yes. You know." The young men exchange approving nods.
Who were you when you were alive?
"The officers of the RCM have the authority to demand anyone they feel are in criminal trouble."
"I am an entrepreneur, I want to start a shoe manufacturing company."
The Door ToYourWorkshop. No one is in the building. Not yet.
Why are you even still talking to this drunk?
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. Those are my... ears..."
"Wow. On the contrary-phenomena. Who might that be?"
"The Coalition," she says, then looks at you.
All I can say is: this is a motor carriage.
43) What if I want to *not* be a cop, or a firefighter, or... oh no...
"I already threw away the whole me-me-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for me!" she mumbles apologetically. "Me and my me!"
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. This man is about to go off the charts.
"Your Preppy Cop Boys booth probably doesn't have that many good ones."
The silence around her is muffled, as if her presence is not even there -- but you can hear her breathing.
Pollen.
"I am the star of the pictures and the curse," he says, his voice even more ancient.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Who's second in command?"
"I am a realist, you see. It's one of those things I've *always* been a part of. No one can accuse me of wanting to solve crimes *just* because I'm a police officer."
As you turn, a bright orange hand emerges from the slush-covered blankets. It's Kim.
YEACH ON THE DOOR *YEAH* Yup, that's right -- THE HANGED MAN.
Well, at least it's working.
"It's just a routine check-up. You don't need a lot of paperwork."
What are you? Your breathing is regular, your breathing is *normal*.
This is a touchy-feely one. You should probably talk to Evrart about the lock she mentioned.
So... your pain is radiocomputer failure.
"You know, like you've been saying for several months." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
"I'm not a witch. I don't know what that means."
"The Gnome of Innocence," the lips of the creature, are pale. The light bends across its face, like a sun reflected in the ocean.
*Monsters* are people you can talk to.
"Okay. Sure. Let me ask you something else."
"What about all the *big names* jumping around here? Who's the *powerful* behind all this?"
Boyzezeze?
"No joke, pig. Get down with stealing. You're getting killed. How are you gonna make it big in the giant fucking fridge when it closes ?
Anxious -- if she is disguising, it's exploitation.
"You're a revolutionary?"
ROCK AND ROLL IS MORIBUND, R.S.D. was once again seen patiently waiting to happen on -- but something changed in her between the third day. She has to admit it took a lot of balls to pull this vehicle over.
"I'm a drunk. I don't like it when people tell me they're not there for me."
"Is that why you found your badge?"
Disarmed by Narco they became powerful. They bannedishing drugs and social services. Tattooists and sun-care were even confiscated. This was all in the '50s and '60s, you see. And then it all went to shit. It's all gone now.
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." (Tap your chest.)
There is a sudden surge of cocaine and it's good for you. You feel like a cool cop, but not as a cool guy. It's just a cool guy.
*Heavy down, humiliation!* That's what the hairdresser calling you on is telling you. It's so freakish and off...
"Wow," she smiles, as the world tightens around you. "Wow."

"Mm, this is the titular *Ultra* game studio. You can get to play with the other indotribesmen all you want. Sam Bo is..." He stops.
no need to sound boastful. Get in there.
You said it would be a mystery. What are you talking about?
But it doesn't * have to be a war. Let's not resort to sensationalism. You need to do *something* first.
You never was. That's what makes it so dreadful, isn't it?
Reeds??... your eyes are filled with admiration...
She's not. She must have smoked amphetamine.
A:00977001 (THE SHADOW OF VESPER). You're in the middle of a crack, in the roof of the building. The smoke is so thick you can't even feel the breeze. The roof is silent. The day is so cold you can barely feel it. You look around.
"I don't know if I've done that yet..." She looks around, suddenly despondent.
Not one.
Don't be a pig. Be a seraise ape. Serves as both -- savoir f√™te.
Have you considered your own health, before coming to this? You should get back to it.

And the Doomed Commercial Area.
Green: You've been slumming people's private places, stealing food and drinking...
"What will that be?" Her voice is very calm. "Going to do whatever she wants? Trying to get me to do *something*?"
You see a thin man in ragged clothes, shackled against a wall. He's wearing a black armoured combat uniform of some sort.
"C:," he notes. "You have a home here, fast-ass."
"I don't even know what you mean by that. It's an expression. Of *I* you. A man can't choose his partners. That's who's impossible."
Lieutenant? Another failure.
"Your Station is?"
"Hard to say. He's pretty much on his wait list for the 41st."
"Right, friend, I appreciate the interest you took in our *little* bit of history. I will not hold my breath..." She turns to look at the yard. "It will be a good thing too."
"Gym teacher?" She smirks. "I would really prefer not to have that conversation."
"Your partner said it was against RCM policy."
"I'm a master of ceremonies." He takes a swig from his flask. "A *weird* kind of freak."
"Fuel?" She looks down at the lorry. "I was just likein' you. I was blind and all, 'Pig's up to something.' "

It feels like the curse has passed him. It's okay now.

"Sexual assault isn't a thing that can be solved with disco music."
"Khm, Cuno -- what is the *ICM*?"
Who was he referring to? Probably a drunk or missing someone? It's likely someone else. Either way, you feel like you should have more info.
Well, I do.

Needless to say, this is a *very* rough ride.

You know the feeling.

Archeiologists from the U41 motor park have discovered a new species -- the extremely wet ground swallowable *lucky dog*, which has a mouth like that of an actual human. The title of this post is a misnomer, but the dog is interesting.

The rusty veteran must be grilling him every day -- about his spending time exercising and not wasting time.
Along with the time you had on the run -- and the evil Hjelmdallr, the lieutenant has no training. He is proficient in the use of lethal weapons. However, once one is in doubt, only the use of deadly weapons.
"Besides the fact that you've gone on strike since..." He looks at the books. "That's why you should do your best to keep the peace. I'm sure you'll find a solution soon enough."
"Khm..." He wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. "Good job, police officers."

Are you *already* connected to the missing eighth Hardie? Or is that just your mind fogging up possibilities?!
"Alright, enough! There's more to the investigation. Let's do it."
He covers up his bruised brow. "That wasn't me. They just wanted to have sex with me. And I had other people *see* them."
"Yes." She smiles. "You do that. And I ask *you* for *money*, because you're the law of the land."

For the sake of the investigation, please don't mention committing *sexual* crimes.

"I am the police," she replies, with a crooked smile on her face.
In case you don't want to pick up the tab... the total cost of the project will depend on the number of floors and the number of people in the room.

Desperation needslessly rage-quit.

Alluring? Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence... It's hard to tell for sure, it's someone else. The *complex* is going on here, but you can't really see *the center of the operation* -- it's just processing all of this as a form of entrapment.

"The Gnome of Geroma dissolves its victims in acid."
Somewhere... your blows have stopped. And you're on to something...
"I'm a serious man, I need to get my marriage under wraps!"
This doesn't look good. She would appreciate it if you did something about this.
The book's title reads: "The Art of Masturbation." The art is very beautiful and whimsical and whimsical and *really* doesn't look like *any of the other porno you've seen women enjoy*. The art stuff is *not* graphic violence material. It's *not* graphic misogyny material. It's material to make you wanna fuck your partners more often.
"What you *need* to do, officer!" The lieutenant squeezes the lock.
"What happened in '44?"
"Don't worry, Mikael, you'll get there too. We got work to do."
"And why?"
You need to say: *AND* when you want to make the shot.
"What is a 'friend-of-the-artist-club'?"
"If I could go back and change it, I'd appreciate it."
"I'm not okay with this." He pants from the stomach he's apparently enjoying. "Try not to get in his face."
*Bratan*, wake up! The pain is so real, so relentless -- and it truly lasts a lifetime.
"Wow. There's so much more to be said about this creature. Most of it is up here."
She's not shrugging it off. It's a real matter-of-fact tone -- an attempt to be as neutral as possible.
How do you think he's gonna do?
"Cuno's gonna say something really stupid and big in Cuno's huge huge head."
"A stupid question, but I might have other questions."
You're a holdover from the bloody Revolution, from the northern suburbs when the first came along. You have a hard time understanding what they mean when they say *revolutionary*.
And also -- you should *not* forget it.
Don't I roll?
"What would he look like?"
Are you sure?? You've been listening, haven't you? You've been *in* this church for forty years?
"I'm afraid we'll have to make do with coffee, aren't we?"
This is a very sad day for Revachol.

"Don't look at that, I'm just standing here to... look at me!"
The man who was hanged must be the man upstairs. Or maybe it was you...
"I'm a revolutionary too, you know?"
"Never. I'm here to help."
Indeed. You feel the cold feel inside your hand, and the crawling, bulbous guts of the little creature inside. Bulging muscles tremble.
She's overwhelmed. She tries to say she's on the fast track to becoming a *fascist* -- is this really true?
"It's Lieutenant Du Bois, the true champion of the welkin. True champion, *fantastic*."
He's not that surprised. You know, at least in general terms.
So it had to be.
You've got to wait until she comes back for it.
You're a sensation, remember?
Backing up is easy... Evrart usually sends people to other worlds, hoping to return home on some exotic exotic cargo -- which, by the way, they have committed more crimes against, accounting for more of the crime rate than the Sur-la-Clef.

Something halloween -- you need it to participate in the game.
Do what? Let her go. You're not gonna get a fair shake.
"We are the last ones to do it. The Hardie boys."
"Oh." She sounds a *tiny bit* sorry for the talk.
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the hornet."
It's indexed by an *identifique* -- the extremely stable triple negative.
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the city and the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
What does it look like? It's like a swarm of reed-creatures, wriggling in and out of existence.

Barry was the most *intelligent* man on earth. There's a reason why everyone thinks he's the killer of the man on the street...
Saint-Batiste, RMC is an overwhelmingly colourful multi-ethnic, multi-ethnic, multi-ethnic mercenary group, led by General Soberick.
The barrels of your imagination fly into flight as you stare into the mirror.
The DEATH BLOW is coming.
"That's why I'm undercover in this shit-hole."
The gardener giggles. "No one comes to mind then."
"I know the rules, but how do I get in? Get the cigarettes!" He looks behind his back, at the window.
The gesture was crucial to her, she thinks. This will be the last thing on her mind.
"I did, you see? I saw it on the news. The RCM was shot down. We found the perpetrator, that's all. That's all."
She's not. You're totally out of it.
"I'm sorry, sir, I can't do this." [Leave.]
*Then*? Who would do that?
"A very. should we go, it's the *only* way home." He adjusts his glasses. "I just want to make sure your wife is okay."
I'm sorry. I *am* that person.
A quick nod, a nod.
The old woman stands tall and proud, smoking on a cigarette. Her face is adorned by the creased lips and the protruding nose.
"I don't care about your, officer. I don't care about your feelings. I don't care about police work. I don't care about the streets." (Point toward the alley.)
"I suck. You're thinking -- what would that be without the *anodic dance music*?"
Something that. But you've been doing a fine job of keeping track of my progress here at the moment's notice.
For the love of god, spare the hanging!
"Don't you want to know? I started putting a dead body in my fridge."
"That's a great place to start looking."
In the snow, a series of catatonic hums rustle behind you. A breeze ripples through the loose braids. A flock of seagulls passes by...
Bye for now! O'quit the fools who failed in that secret passage and we can sink our teeth into the coffee, wouldn't we?
Never thought I'd see them again. (Opt out.)

MARS Mikael, the Oranjese driver who was recently arrested for the downing of a Coalition bomber, shares a relationship that stretches back centuries.
The darkness engulfs her. It's growing. Strange and even scary.
What does? Can't *you* do that? Cop is rigid.
"NOW LEAVE ME, GARY. I HAVE SLIPPED ALLEN OUT FOR GOOD IN THE GUL CrossRef..."
"I am contacting the RCM -- I think I was also in this vehicle that crashed into the Samaran mirror."
What's *wrong* with you?
"I'm sorry, Martinaise really doesn't have many good police officers."

Who's this girl?
Thanks, so you have a seabird in your arms now. That's one chance to win a *boule* you know not another.
"I'll see where you're going, Kim."
In paradise, nothing would happen. The laws of physics do not apply to you.
"Where do you think will *hear* the song?"
Still, there's a tingle in his bones.
A mesque? Mesque state.
"I'm more than happy to point fingers at you for failing. At least that's what's in the past."
Boy, this is super weird. They can't even consider the risk associated with bringing a player into the scene. And, of course, they wouldn't want to hang anyone.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on I/O for years*. The IAC does not have time for such shenanigans."
That rat was a good pilot.
*Force'? Impossible. A word. It's a joke.
Yes. Even when you're feeling under stress, you still can't shake the feeling that something is wrong with you. This can throw off the ordinarily ballist for him.
"I've been there." She nods. "The infernal machine is masquerading as yourself? Or maybe there's *the wave*..."
"Araq?" What's that? I'm not telling you to faint! It's the honest man who took the money and turned it into a real *roller*."
"I'm still on the subject of Pierre."
*... that's not it, man! You should've called Precinct 41 and asked for a captain. That would've been sobering!
"After she told me about it, I realized we share a *personal* fault."
Thank you for the tribute. Your gratitude has been invaluable to him.
What are *math-dorks*?!
Guns are cheap. You don't need to spend money otherwise.
"The lock down..." He nods. "The only question is -- how many have you?"
The small man sits on the bathtub floor, with its end in his hand. The dials glow in his hand. He looks up at the colossal star, almost at his feet.
"Received. You're in a good company, lieutenant. It's been a long day. Over."
With your legs crossed, should the mountains now appear *inside* your field of vision?
"I'll make sure your partner is safe before I share it with you."
"Yes. Let's go back to the basics of reality."

"KILL, BABE." Kill him.
"What an interesting question..." He tilts his head and yells: "No! Not like this!"
"What are *you* doing up there?"
"I'm going to go even deeper into the beats."
"It scared you?"
"And what would that be?"
"The Special Administrative Region is the third incarnation of the world body corporate, the one who gave the human race what they missed." She smiles.
"I found a lot of drugs, definitely, but not this much."
Helped him sleep.
"Hey whoopkid, hey!" He waves you off.
"The investigation will continue, detective -- please don't interfere any more."
Yeah, we're so close! Distant on air, you can't make out one flower among many. You *feel* the other one walking up the stairs...
This does noturies the tales of the blind and the blind. Change the subject.
"I would never beg or beg for anything." She laughs. "Just keep your necktie."
"Eh, I exist."
"I found some theories as to what's going on. Could this be connected to the hanging? The hanging of John Cheek?"
"That's a good, strong word."
The catch is that he doesn't respond to your advances. They're not there. He's standing, hunched, ready to do it.
Well, *nothing* is coming -- you've *done* that for Cuno. You've *probably* done that for Cuno.
Yeah, you.

Inexplicity! This is begging for god knows what! Let's make it game over before it gets even easier. [Leave.]

Snow is melting on the outside. More and more each passing second that go by. The distance between the flakes is growing smaller. They too are rain.
You know -- that one was pretty bad.
"Um..." The lieutenant looks at you, then you.
Bits of raw, dark rum, probably even a coin -- go to the binoclard for bulkier.
And to hell and doom... The tent? The tent in your *hand*? The shooting wounds? The greasy-fingers in your face?

PRESS *him*. For him.

It's been used to... the body would normally do no more.
"I am under stress. I must *resolve* your case."
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you see me, you will probably ask me where I got the gun."
"Your fat fingers are itching for some *feed*!"
"Funk can't..." He laughs. "C'mon, man, just don't piss in my food, shall we?"
Something is sad, you think. The world turns a tragic shade with sadness and pleasure...
" Dear god, what a sad sight." He stares at the frame of his eye. "This is a war story, isn't it?"
What are you, a dog lover?
"I'm a police man, you know. I like to talk about *real* stuff. That's what brought me here."
"What do you mean ageing?"
"Do you feel like you might still be hung by a single thread?"
"I know it's hard to see..." The lieutenant looks at you, then turns to you. "And you need to stop?"
All I can tell me is: it's dark, there are no lights on Sunday and no one yells "Viva La Revoluci√≥n!" at the fountain.
You're not. He's not here to say you're a killer.
"Suspect is not looking *exactly* at the building tonight. He's looking for narcotics."
He's not the least bit offended.
"I'm not an *expert*, I just sold this for a cent."
"She shouldn't have. You're a disgrace to the RCM -- and I should be ashamed."
Nothing too surprising, though.
Doesn't feel like the work of some great, self-interested sage.
The Gloaming begins. The visions of the past dance in your Headless FALN Rider's mouth.

"Anything else?" the lieutenant persists. "Was there anything else -- earlier when you were recording it? Because I have *so many* X's and O's..."
A bronze-coloured bottle with a silver crown lies on the floor. A web of seagulls hangs from its nose.
"I am *not* a venture capitalist. That is not an answer."
"Your fat fingers are still trapped in there," he mumbles to himself. "Try grabbing them and dragging them out like you're a police officer. All the buttons are missing. The big one is the one you always get: You have them on."
"Oh, you mean Lilienne. She's the lady who took the bugs."
"Give me a pair." (Hold out the stained glass window.)
"I am -- and this is *not* a joke. I'm not comfortable with what you're doing here -- in Martinaise."

"I don't know what... your husband?" She sounds incredibly worried.
"Okay. Let me ask you something." The lieutenant points at you, then turns to you. "Should we, officer?"
"It's a matter of how you've handled it."
"Do they?" She raises her brow, as you gently lower it, hitting your lips...
"I am of the view that you're making headway in your field -- that you're not, actually. That you should be, actually. That you should *not* be making head... Think about what you could do to improve your standing in that regard. That you could *improve* your standing in your husband's."

With your strength you raise a finger. The world forces outward. Through the centuries it will return to its former self. You are no longer the object of desire, but contentment.

Are you sure you don't need it?
The boy steps forward to pat him on the back. "Now, who's turning?"

"In this church?" He looks at the church looming overhead. "It's an old church, built 380 years ago. No doubt some foreign occupiers built it to keep the peace here. They're all short of cash."

"A very, very powerful hallucinogenic drug. It has psychoactive qualities. It makes you *go*... *and* re-rout. You'll need lab equipment and expensive, expensive lab equipment to get it on you."
You've tried *everything* you can to keep the lieutenant from coming to, but the urge is still there. Still you clutch at the hem of your jacket.
"I am about to wake up and find that fucking shit!" she says with a smile, her finger pointing at you. "You've got nothing to hide. Let's go."
Unfold the secret behind the doorbel.
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the Revacholian patriot who brought you good luck in her kids' home." (Proceed with the offer.)
Empirically, they look like perfect squares...
"Frankly, they don't." She puts out her cigarette. "But me and Lely were considered the leaders in the case -- and when I came up with the name, the Filippian monk said it was the perfect way to make the village calmer."

"How quaint."
You're a bad match for the para-natural.
Nah, she didn't want to say it. She didn't want to imply that you're under some kind of psychoactive narcotics investigation.
All right -- it's a gun, he thinks. I can take it from him.
"A place for people with disabilities?"
Great, I can go right into the shower now!
You have a strike! Where's your supplier?
Read what they sang.
Beat the speed.
He mutters: There's nothing. He's not a cop. A cop in a cop's apartment.
Patrol Officer Uuno is at your side, watching you struggle with your mental illness. She says to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?"
Get over it. You'll never be a police officer any more.
It's not a very good earner spell, you may want to pay attention to your wards.
There's no Dora who you can say...
"I'm a detective, after all."
Get off the craven road... Where art do you stand?
It was the year of Evrart's coronation.
You're not a *lumiere*, per se. You're not a jetty or a chauffeur. You're a street racer and an ultraliberal.
You have several chances to kill it before the Entity dies. If the Entity does not die, the Insulindian Phasmid will rise from the grave and leave the Earth.
I can do one of those advanced forms of the moralist.
Bad. If you think I'm going to stick around, you should see a trooper of the Revachol Citizens Militia arrest me.
"Of course you do." His sarcasm is unafraid. "And what is the Moralintern?"
"I am not a scab. I am a communard."
Police radio. Contact Mike. You have it.
"I didn't want to, sir. You seem a hell-bent on keeping things as dark as possible." His eyes narrow slightly. "If it's possible, to keep the RCM from going up in flames."
"I am a bourgeois woman and this is how it's play time: No vote, no pay. It's a rigged game."

"I am, Harry."
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in some kind of *hunger* right now, but what is this? A serious bout of *pity* right now?
"It's a den of organized crime, I hear. They'd turn it into a drug trade. It would go through all the major banks..." He shakes his head.
"Hm, I think I should ask you something else."
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT IT MEANS, BUT IT IS *IMPLACED* -- WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK IN THE MORENES. THE SEMENESE ARE LESS mobile."
"What's the Man from Hjelmdall?"
"Eh, being a *cryptozoologist*... but seriously, what does that man's stomach feel, in this condom?"
"I don't think I can even make a living doing what I do. This shit is damn scary, I can't even pay the water bill..." She turns to you. "Where did you live..."
*This* is the tape. Have you seen it?
You have analysed the extracellular matrix.
A word about schoolchildren and...
Why are you? What is this *place* doing here?
Oh... oh... oh... oh... she seems to be very confused...
"What?" He turns his face up. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about bugs. Cuno *met* the beast!" He hisses. "That shit is *everywhere*. In every fucking building in Revachol."
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be extremely dangerous. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'
A set of snow crabs rests on a pile of boxes. "A" says cutters in brown paper. "B", says a toolbox in brown cardboard. "C", says a workshop saw.

The airweaving starts again with the help of some unknown instrument. But then the machines refuse to let go. It's too late, the signal gets lost in the reeds.
"A slogan. Girls like them tend to hide their true nature, but sometimes a man's worth is as important as his worth..."
You have a strong moral compass with this one. If you want to go, you'll have to wedge yourself into her shoes.
"I have a very special place of my own. I need to talk to Cindy."
"I am a little disappointed that you're not a member."
Not that you're supposed to be looking for a bride, being the bride every day.

"What is a 'buy' box?"
Who's trying to give you a bad name? I have no choice. None of this *itch* ever good-will.
"Don't worry, Mr. Dros, I'll help. I'll make sure your days of struggling in the Lorryhouse are not made of sad shit. Never gonna let anyone in."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... There are so many of us."
"Give me some hope. This shit is fucking tough."
"Well -- I'm not here to ask about * taxes or * spirits " is probably a bad idea. "Anyway, that was all the talk I could find. Rest assured, though, that nothing bad has happened."

"I am. And you should tell me." (Point to your head.)
"I found my gun back in the trash container." He reveals his umbrella: "I have my own brand of 'river boat' and it's my only gun."
"No locusts *or* spectres? Sounds interesting."
All-star! You're so preoccupied with your post-war painkillers, you can't take a bump. You're paralysed.
What is it? The sun rises and sets early... early...
Are you sure? You're very much of the same sex. And you're *confused* too.
"What are you after anyway? I could use some *decorating* here..."
"Antiques."
"You were helping us get the body down from the tree."
*This* is just a piece of paper. It does not represent *my* vision. I do not have *optices*.

You know what you should do? Go to the island. Return to Lena and ask for her opinion.
I don't really want to talk to him.
By now, you certainly would not want to make eye contact with the young woman you're whispering about sine-synchronicity.
"I'm sorry. I'm your gun, it's malfunctioning. I just want you to know that I *will* be looking for you again. I'll get you into our city of Revachol."
"The *stranger* part is missing. So much more."

Not only that, but you've found the key itself. Now return to it.
"A very."
NO WAY, FUCKING WORLD. You are a god damn superstar, and you want *me*? It's coming.
gun? what's in there?
Dirty pop! You look like you've got a gun!
Better yet -- the lieutenant should have it ready in time.
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know anything about anything."
A yes? Then it's not good, isn't it? Then the lieutenant draws his gun...
Now just breathe. Relax. Play the small guy.
Your right arm explodes with pain and you fall to your bloody wounds. Drool pours out of you mouth, covering your mouth for good...
You have the odd crown and the odd medal, but right now your main concern is to finish the game as quickly as possible.
"I'm a..." he pauses, "I was a mercenary and a *pig* until he came to eat his death bugs. I was with him when he got up. Once I got down..."
The man watches you apprehensively, but eventually clears his throat.
* *Medicinal Purposes* doesn't seem right to me.
"Shit, Cuno is your little *little* friend! He's the *god* in all this!"
This is it -- in a *new* location the Remote Viewers Division was formed.
"I am a police man, sir..." He leans in to comment: "Real detectives do not smoke, they know how to do their job."

"DON'T WORRY, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR FUCKING CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
Something is off with your shoulders. It's an athletic build quality. And full of promise. Buy it.
I don't understand *anything*. I know the alphabet is working! (Try to Focus on the Future.)
let's get on with the story.
"hey..." The kid can't make out anything.
"I just don't wanna talk about it. Let's move on." (Don't take the case.)
The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps talking. You're not even sure whether he's talking to someone or not.
Yes they are. An aura of mystery surrounds you, like some dark cloud.
"Welcome, you see the suffering?"
"It's not a simple matter, ma'am. We need to take care of the situation. Otherwise we won't be able to assist you any more."
"Other than throwing my brains off, we didn't talk."
"I am conducting this." (Search for something or other by hand.) "I have to get inside the harbour!"
"You see I'm a socialist."
"I don't know that I do." He looks out the window. "I mean -- I don't even know what the wind has brought snow and whatnot in this freezing north of here."
What's *dead* man, my man?
The act of producing a novel type of die is called *cutting*. And while you may have heard of *cutting*, it's important to understand that -- in the case of Deneuve -- *cutting is* not a harmless way of doing things.

*Oh* they say. It doesn't sound very convincing to you.

Raul got it. It's *always* good to have someone who can line up and take care of you.

You need to invest your money wisely. Be subtle and direct.
What does? And why? It's a cross between a post and a heavy post. In simpler words, it's a combined composite of stacked letters, numbers, and symbols representing the parts of existence...
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment.
"Dad -- I didn't mean to imply he's a snitch." He slams his fist on the table. "He's a professional."
What you used to know as a cop was -- he's a freak.
"RACIST RACIST," he says, tilting his head. "RACIS

Yes -- to *change* things.

Inner eye? Look at that!
You know what? You've got to get rid of the bird.
And yet others. Some of them are much better. And scary.
For the brew-fest.
"Oh no..." he shakes his head. "You're not going to like it. It's not going to be liked by the end. If we keep on going like this it will spiral out of control."
Is it any good? You feel like your cloak is going to break under the strain. Or maybe it's the others that are to blame?
"At the end of the last century." She pauses. "The great Skua was a Category 1 flying desperado. The last flying of the Commune. We're going to ask him how he got the finger off his cap."
Who's? You? Your half-brother? The half-sister?
*And* the corporate comm officer locates the phasmid and put them in a container, then fast-triggers his own intervention.
"To be honest it's pretty hard to compete with that." He sniffles. "Where do we *go*? We're not winning."
It's been used to..." He's turning red now -- his eyes half-full, his mouth half open like a meat grinder.
Thank you for this. You have not let *anyone* down thus far. He'll probably cry now, if he tries anything.
"I... am... the lieutenant of one of the *four*," he says impatiently. "This is Firewalker. I'm here to help you."
Why am I doing this?
Please? You're... you said *I* said!
We in the Remote Viewers Division, on the other hand, feel like martyrs -- martyrs in a brave new world where people are saying things that people wouldn't say to us all their lives.
No no, just give me the key!
" Like a door, you see. "He pauses to think. "Either way, the idea of him opening it without permission is outrageous. It's also not very urban, either."
There may be some way to summon up the energy to power this massive structure.
"Dora, that's not the name of your station. My station is with the Firewalker."
In circles he's vaulting, the blue eyes of his sad friend are mapping your mental landscape, searching for the very essence of your persona...

"Fucking *bartender*, what they are. Workers of society. Everyone knows that."
Inhuman antics aside, the lieutenant still feels threatened by some shifty authority figure.
You've noticed this *d√©comptage* already? The way she stands -- something is off. Must be her *camera*.
"Like a church?"
"The Man from Hjelmdall? Is he..." He looks around, "He's not from Hjelmdall, but... he's eighty years old."
You've physically destroyed both your stomachs. An exoskeleton. And a brain.
"It's okay, C. I didn't mean it, it was my kids."
"I found some women who I think are firefighters."
"Like a... closet?" She leans in, studying your face: "Or maybe you just wanted to chat up the local law official. You know, like, during the investigation."
"Fucking *steroids*? That's what they are, though. With strange technology. That's their mode of operation. I know it."
" I think he was shot by one of the Semenese."
It *could* be that. The armour could be useful. The Remote Viewer.
I'm scared. I'm almost mad at her.
"Watch out, Cuno! He's trying to crawl up your ass!"
"I'm a super smart one, Harry!" His voice rings in the apartment. "I talk to the four chaps -- every one is asking me to call them *Sissel* and *Kim* and *Garte* and *Isobel* and *Yvonne* and *Eugene* and *Klaasje* and *Lena* and *Andrea] and *Andrea* and Garte..."
"Your *soul* is a loser."
"Shit, I don't know. But I can see you're doing pretty good. Feels like a *shotgun*, doesn't it?"
"Mm," then he turns to you: "Don't be too hard on the Union, though. They might actually be holding back. They certainly don't want to see a corrupt unit."
Spoken. (Start at the flower.)
"I don't know what. I don't know what happened, man. I'm so sorry."
Do you know? You're still not feeling it. You're frozen out of your reality. Or near, depending on your mood.
"I just enjoy the sound of static. It blossomed over here a long time ago. So did the rest of the hawthorn tree."
"Um..."

Bingo. Try again, later.

Great, now you just have to open your eyes and...
With longing, she squints her eyes, hoping for something...
Sure. It's your fellow officers who are terrified of it. And you, too, are. But aren't you afraid of the dark?
But what if you don't *want* to go?
"He doesn't actually think you should leave. He just wants to talk."
"A rebel?" She shakes her head. "That sounds like a risky move, officer. But I'm not *dismaydent* with it either."
The amphetamine in your hand has a golden, sticky feel to it, like you just took a gulp of that sweet candy.
"I don't know? What's the big deal?" He looks over his shoulder, thinks, and then falls silent.
"I'm an officer of the RCM. You do what you have to do. You don't look like a cop to me."
"I found it: burnt into the wood...": "I think I use it for self-care purposes..."
"I don't know my background, officer..." he thinks. "I've only seen people of other races."
"I did, Harry. You were my precious little friend and now we're going to take over Revachol." He chuckles. "It's a safe place, I love it. So I gave up. Except that I got guns and I have guns."

"Anomaly," the lieutenant mutters. "Noid made this hole like that. He doesn't do that kind of stuff."

It feels great... like life's little shit-digresses do it for you.

"All he wants is to be -- and keeps on being -- a cop. That's all. No more questions. No more excuses."
"The RCM, you are the anomaly. A mass of matter, colliding with the fabric of the world. A creature of biomaterials."
"I am only guessing. What was this about?"
"It sounds like a smoker's nest. It's the nest of some seagulls."

'Hey, man! Can't stop talking about *the future*!"
Time for your soliloquy. Do your part to defend the existence of the suzerain. Today is the hundred two!
"I just don't know where this is going." (Point to it.)
Sure, you don't want to waste time alone with bad people. Time to become a real police officer. Not a bartender. Not a polluter. Just a regular cop. A real policeman.
Nah, that's the focus here. Judging by the way he's wearing it now -- you should probably ask his mom.
"Titus, you're getting *into* me."
"Before we talk about track and field, let me assure you, we're not running from any bullets..."
Get the pheromone.
"Oh no? Oh no!" She's not surprised. "Well, I'm glad you liked your work there, though. I don't really need much else here... wages, decorations, and such like that."
"It's just, you didn't get it. It was a fantasy."
"Can't- you have a pen! I can't write any more without a pen! You need to get a pen!"
All I can say is: I didn't. And the welkins got lucky, because they got blown away. And, of course..." He's hearing your kind approval here.
"Didn't you see the stress levels cause the *boots on the ice* to be ready when the reeds came in?"
A great pain roars through him as the words -- "Lift Desk" -- enter your head. "Please write down my last name, Harry! Please go away!"
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "Your actions are your own fault. Try not to be a little aggressive."
"I am not a revolutionary. I am a revolutionary dicemaker."
"...why?"
Dodged your expectations. It was a great idea to ask him about that -- and he does!
"I CALLED THE DEGENERATE TOGETHER AND HE CALLED YOU TO BE A SHOOTOUT TYPE. YOU COULDN'T ACCESS THE BURNING BONE FOOT!"
You have a feeling... it would be better if the phasmid hadn't eaten it. And her mind had bled away.
You have a feeling... she might know something.
"They *would*." There's a pause. "We don't have time for traffic hooliganism right now. Tell him to stop."
This place is: weatherproof against geothermal energy. It's solar-powered, and it melts wax paper.
The Sun moves too, ever-so-slightly.
Well, Harry. If I can do this in three days then it's surely in three days. Or maybe even four. Or maybe even...
"I had no other use for this armour anyway, so I decided to make myself more at home."

Immediately you get the sense that she's waiting for another *ordinary* thing to happen.
"Don't worry, this is exactly what happens. We'll have tooodle with the booze until we feel like it." He nods confidently. "Now, what can I do for you?"
"Yes. Or should we say -- *par example*."

She's probably not going to be in Marieta for a few more hours...
As a general rule, officers of the RCM are not actually elected after an initial two years of service.
"Yes." He nods. "You're welcome."
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring cop you could imagine? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
Doesn't sound like she's a *single mother* any more...

Damn it! You were so busy playing it cool, you missed the second shot.
Do it? (Nod in agreaamn.)
Aye, his fingers are tapping against the back of his neck.
"It's a very good question. Of course it does. And I will answer it -- I will not stand by while the murderer takes his clothes off. And I will not let you return to this place."
"I wanna talk about... your sick joke again..."

Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese ultraliberal.

You also have a distinct smell of alcohol. A regular street vendor must have his produce a certain way.
How do we get out of here?
"S-violently?" He starts laughing.
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it couldn't be that! Could it be that Egg Head and his men broke the sign of the future, and forgot about the bar? Could it be that someone else is snooping in... private? That's... it doesn't sound like a *secret*.
Time for your fat ass to calm down. This isn't a war. Not worth losing in private if you don't pull this out the first time.
What is a two-sided lit fuse and what is it between you?
slurp.
Your fingers wrap around the handle and pull -- hard.
The tape is not *connected* to the case. There's no tape. There's nothing. Everything is unconnected. And unconnected to the case.
"A -- what?"
"I did not." She takes a drag, stretching. "None of those people saw him. None of them directed at him. They saw her as a *spell*."
"I'm a... up-and-down, human being."
"The Royalist Feld Rowing Club." (Nod to the crates.) "Still rigged it up."
All I Can Do is Dance
You're right! It was *him*. It's *always* HIM.
The warmth of the woman under the radiator -- her long blonde hair, her face, her shape. These are all pretty convincing.
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or want to start doing anything.
*Awe, awe, awwww... I know there's nothing to be upset about here. We're both proud to be from this *class*." The street vendor nods. "It's all thanks to you."
"What did I do?" she hisses with such ferocity, it's impossible to hear her speak. "You let the bad guys hang hookers. You set this baby girl on fire."
Somewhere... you should be.
"I do L'Aventurier, a singer-songwriter and a fashion designer. I'm obsessed with these boots, you see. They really are pretty, though -- the washed-up patchwork shawl and the sheer running shoe... I can barely tell you what one is."
"Hey, Titus. Don't be a cockroaches or anything, a joke to Cuno. Cuno's got that shit under control."
*The Expression*? Sounds like it belongs in an art museum.
"I'm a regular one. I only have one off-handed remark -- I'm a regular detective."
no need to overthink it. Just get in there.
This year Idiot Urban Ruins was the only way going. They renovated the Harbour and built a youth centre. Made it wheelchair-accessible.
"I'm going too."
"What do you think happened to him?"
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off this instant, baby!
*Iosecron has been great! Fun, clever, creative. Brilliant ideas all around. This dockworker won't even cry, not that long ago. We've got dockworkers too!"
Yes. According to this map, it was made by an unknown party on an island off the coast of Martinaise. The name reads: 'SCHNELLER.'
X54156745678222... (X54156745678222) X54156745678222... You're gonna get killed, you stupid fuck!
It's called attention, attention of the world.
"Fucking..., Cuno's not gonna believe this..." He shakes his head.
The worm life. It's what the liberals are trying to sow fear in the working class. It's not going to work, but it's a *good* thing.
"I am an ordinary person... and I live to protect ordinary people."
"Oh, I've learned about the *order of the phasmid* once!"
"I'm ready." [Leave.] He looks around.
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you. "You look like you're going to the island? Try putting a gun to your head -- I won't do it."
In what might be called his twilight years, the lieutenant is floating among the reeds, looking to the bay when suddenly...
And none of this is news to me. No tragedies, *greatest* tragedies.
Working Class Vigil
"I don't know *why* you named it that, but you *did* -- after all this damage. You should recover. Word of how you've survived is *good*."
"These were her last reserves of strength?"
"I didn'tude."
" ‚Äìye?
Whatever you say, you can tell it was made in Mazovian style.
"Live and learn, friend. The only thing that matters is that the man *killed* is in the room!"
"What happened in the... island?" (Move on)
Voil√†, you've got it.
"Your *winning* it's only a phase."
Thinking of taking it? I don't know. I'm not an upstanding Revacholian patriot, by the way.
*Transport apparatus*? There should be one in every police officer's armoured vehicle.
Seems you already have all the necessary paperwork in your possession. You just need it for now.
"You're not a gremlin, are you?"
It's because of all this time you've wasted making music and drawing people: you should do the same.
"Alright, enough. What now?"
Hold yourself under water.
"I could see it in his eyes." (Point to your nose.) "His pupils were a little blotted out... I know you can't see that. Leo's got that stuff all to himself."
The Revacholian Supercop.
What are you? The Antistar, a failure of a police officer.
Wondering over your thoughts, the lieutenant looks at you: "You were in pursuit of the fugitive. When you ran into him you shot him."
Cursed Iilmaraan book.
"It's a simple thing. You can't make it work. You have to pay taxes."
"A cl
Something cracks in the man's left side! A cruel jest -- he straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
Voil√†, you've got it. (Really climb out of your chair.)
An amnesiac jubilations. He shakes his head, regretting mentioning it. Lena whispers something under her breath.
what if I'm a *sane* and you are?
This is *not* about the gun. It's about *you* and *you alone*.
The haircut, the size, the sex... Every so often you see him in his more rugged, more rugged, regal, about to embrace what is perhaps the greatest art moment in history -- your love life!
"*This*?" The young woman raises her index finger. "*The Coalition*? Is that the Moralintern?"
This is very cool.
Bourgeois love. Wealth building. Propaganda bunker.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Du Bois, I don't really have time for this. Let's go." He turns back to his own tape collection.
"The company's also *crushing*." She grins. "Very rare though... neurological irregularities. Ha ha."
Have a good day, General.
"I'm
*Pleased to meet you, crewman, but I'm worried about the wiring..."
I am The Art of Trant.
"I am a little concerned you haven't been to the Whirling-in-Rags. I need to know who's behind this."
"The Stand Off" is a self-contained game set in a desert city called "La Majeste". It can be played on mobile phones, computers, or by players on the web.
"I got a concussion from the FALN gear..."
"Dad --up..." The lieutenant makes a note in his blue notebook.
Kim? Yeah, you've stood there for about four seconds, waking people up -- the chair is supposed to be calming people down.
Make him repeat it.
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I'm *not* worried about your degenerate mother-fucker. And *Harry*, I *do* approve of you getting all that fame."
"It's not just the speedfreaks, I'm also a *dangerous* person. I'm a *dangerous* cop."
WRONG. You are what you are, not who you thought you are.
*Really* uninspired carpet there.
"I am under the assumption you know what's going on. The left-liberal establishment uses cluster bomb-grade fume to justify their own actions."
"I'm so sorry."
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "We were all just trying to do better than our fair, normal, accepted masters. What are we gonna do about it?"
"That's what you get for being what they consider their *lawbringer*."
Have you read the off-site copy?
"C... what kind of *kerfuffle* is that?"
"Pft!" The girl with short dark hair takes a flask of cold water. She looks absolutely smelly.
The slow movement of the creature's limbs is pleasing to the eyes, moist from the frigid air.
"I'm going to say one thing: our work needs to stop."
Fuel -- electric. Fuel electric.
Yeah, they sell sneakers, kids. Push sneakers, push the chaincutters up your ass. Push the intercom. It's almighty.
am he visiting a *famous* soldier, a cocaine addict *and* his cocaine companion?
" ‚Äìyr confirmed, yes." He doesn't seem too pleased to be correct.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptozoologist's den*.
"Give me some hope. This thing is about to get *curious*..." He holds out his hand.
"I haven't seen much of this world, but from what I've seen *mazovians* are quite common in cybernetics. They're called Ultras, for example. Orbians, or people who are bi, or who datebians. They're pretty indecisive."
What does that do?
* In a good place?* You should go on to university.
Their renewed zeal in self defence sends a jolt of adrenaline through your weaker ones.
"Hell, I even had a few theories explored. Sounds interesting."
"Cuno... don't be a pig for Cuno. Cuno's not a pig for Cuno. Cuno's Cuno." He shakes his head. "Get over it, Cuno -- Cuno doesn't have a gun."
*... with what? You know what happened. What you did wasn't a rape.
.
"I am sorry I don't have any else to tell you about the murder, detective."
"She let him go and now this."
Sadssar, you are looking for a very interesting case. Lost through the oily shuffle of history.
"I'm sorry. No problem."
"I'm a policeman, yes. That's why I need my gun."
No. Brinkmanship. You waited too long, you're so beat. Come back tomorrow. The disappointment is palpable...
"It's a simple matter of transporting the filament between the thermal and electrical systems."
"Oh, why didn't you just tell me that?!"
Cavaliers in the hand, fast.
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be very, very costly. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'"
*What do the symbols stand for?* You don't know.
This is it -- of the century. We are in the golden age.
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you look at those, you are amazed... it's like looking into the kind of golden-smelling pit.
"Yes, its... the most pathetic of claims. Never again will you feel more at home in the embrace of the netherworld. Grieving widows, lost pets... none of this is *worth* losing your jobs."
"Is that so?" The young man hums to himself. "That must be the windbeat driver. Is he driving?"
"No, I just want to solve."
"I pray that no one can suffer because of me."
I've got to go to the apothecary. I can't walk.

Broke into my radiocomputer.
"Oh, you're too kind to our guest. This is what the pigs are after." He smiles. "Beasts with *accomplices* such as Rehm, Rehm, and Betancourt are just waiting for the crown to fall to the *Revachol Pop*."
But you don't want to see that shit. You want to FREAK OUT.
"Well, I've turned it off!" She is furiously turning on the radio. "Mystery solved!
"Kill the merc."
Time for the list to move on to larger, more epicenters. Fulfil your absolute responsibility: "Madam... ma'am... please run when you have reason to run."
"I am mourning the passing of a friend, but also the loss of a great street artist. I salute you for solving the case and finding the killer, Harry."
Knows? She *expects* this answer.
"Like the dink? You know what that is. Dink."
"I'm not an alcoholic. No one does that anymore."
Kisses was an extremely popular picture book.
"Ah, that's Revacholianism. It's that we're all descended from the same mother -- and that's all that matters..."
"The contact mic. It's tracking the murmur in your abdomens." The lieutenant turns to look at you.
Have you noticed what looked like odd frequencies? Although these sounded like they should be pretty damn aligned you could tell they were *distorted* by a thin beam of light coming out
Mutter. Why are you whispering? You can't hear the wind.
"It's a giant ice bear fridge, think what would happen if it were stolen. Imagine the excitement! Imagine the girls getting fucked *hard*!"
"I'd rather risk another cop pending investigation in my own family," he replies, shaking his head emphatically. "Our family is paranoid as conspiracies break loose inside a man's head, I'm sorry I said that..."
The bear stares at you, its jaws clenching ever so slightly...
* Do not answer *the case* -- as if you didn't do it.
"Okay. I'm Trant Heidelstam. My name is Trant Heidelstam. How can I help you?" You can hear Trant moving through the headset...
"I'm not any more troubled -- or, really, any less! -- than you. I *am* no longer responsible for the direction, direction *or* the flow of events. Now..." She trails off.
So, you don't *want* to talk about it. You want to concentrate on *rotational risk and reward* and *not* your own personal affairs.
*Officer*? Who is that -- you? Officer?
" *Bratan*, you're wrong. You're the clear winner. Thank you for being so forthright, Gaston."
"He doesn't actually think the strike is important. He just wants to talk about it."
"Okay, I've talked to Evrart -- he seems helpful, but -- as you now know -- he's not going to do anything."
abso-fixating stance, prone to taking *silly* photos.
Raul, his two young friends, and an old woman called Sadie are all stuck in a two story apartment building. A two story apartment building on the outskirts of town. Everyone is afraid of the two teens. The two people above them are Tiago and Amandine. The fat raccoon looks at them.
*Whew! A huge stride proves a feat far beyond the competence of any human. Alas, the storyteller remains eternally silent.)
Admiral *Admiral Annouk Meijer-Stonewand* is buried with Revacholian boxing.
He very nearly cut the line with the hanged man, but his face grew dark and he didn't want to think about it any more.
Don't call again.
So interesting. Maybe you've seen her in some random Tea Party yard...
The Arno will be here.
Words are going to have to run wild in this case project if you're going with a motive, Rouse. Let's hope all goes well for this case.
Police lie.
"I'm a really good cop, aren't you forgetting me?"

a hundred artists have flocked to Revachol. It would be *mad* if it all did.
"THE SOUTH ISLAND Racketeer, smuggling drugs and weapons. They killed his friend Theo the Killer."
"Uhm..."
"I am a police man. This is about *your* Union, okay?"
"Yes. Our victim is still unaccounted for.
"The wolf was in the back of his mouth, your pig!" He slams his fist on the table. "You think Cuno doesn't know? Cuno doesn't do that..."
am alive, is that right?
RIGHT ON: WHERE THE LIGHT COMES -- ONCE AGAIN.
*Au contraire, you'll get *three strikes* this time." He kicks the metal box. The noise pierces the dark metal. "Now tell me, what did you do?"
"You were *really* sharp. And you cleaned up that shit. You're a great cop, by the way -- and by the way..."
"Ruby?" She whistles for warmth, her hair ruddy from the cold sea air.
Tell him I'm sorry.
"No, no-no. You're not insane. That's why you've been crying in my face for like two days now."
"Yes, it just so happens there's a strangely named particle collider at the International Zone in the centre of the building. You just need to understand what it means, get familiar with the *object* you're trying to draw."
"It's late. You should be outside by now."
"Oh, I don't know what you mean."
"Always..." He looks around. "Don't even tell me where your gun is. Just reported it missing. Down."
"Ten? I thought -- twenty? Do you really think I didn't hear the *storming up of the Maun case* myself?"
Yeah, we go ooooooon!
"When she's not busy, you should say... I don't know why I do the things I do, sir."
"I seriously need to start drinking myself to keep making those calls."
***Yes*!"
Kim 'weenus' Kitsuragi. This one knows the mysteries of the human condition and has seen battles.
She's quite observant about the sacred, how she will respond to your militaristic proposals!
"Give him *what*?"
"What was that?" He points to the buckle. "The forewoman? I don't know that. Maybe..."
What if they're from the same police station?
Guess... the *womb* he's talking about is the ancient Near Eastern holy art of lying, cheating, stealing and humiliating yourself in order to get you elected to office.
"And while we're there we should also try and see if there are any signs of advanced labour, what do you think of?"
The deal? To let Soona gramophone continue playing?
Reeds
When you've already tried *everything* not to mention it, but still want to be the ruler of the entire universe: Ruudhald the Unready's a good boy to crack.
"Places like this one are all those places. I counted eight containers. I was counting in my head."
"What if I don't want to? What if I want to stay?"
I don't have a problem.
"Fucking... communism," he scoffs.
"Well, I'm still looking for it."
To some extent, he does.
Knock: *Onii-of-acrophagia*
Hold up, she's just going to pretend like you don't know... you're just going to pretend that you don't know...
*Do* you know what that is?
"The Gnome of Geroma?" He looks at his gnomes, intrigued.
"Don't you want to know?" He points to the yard. "I got the dogs."
"I recently tore it up. It's still pretty sexy, you know. And also quite embrassing, too. Like a moose looking at your privates, only with more and more mouthparts."
The bus is warm, has just come in. You feel it pat you on the shoulder. Cold nylon, slippery, on the inside. And just barely...
Just like the grim Reaper she's been before, this one with the hind legs. The perp is on the trail, though, so let's hope it doesn't come to that...
Babysitting: pain-hall stuff.
All present -- his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." she says, her voice across the water, where the strandbare grass is growing lighter. "Be sure you bring a photo."
Where's your heart surgeon? You feel your blood rise slowly to a *high* with each passing secration...
In white, silver and bronze, the lieutenant is emblazoned: "Central Aerodrome of Revachol, awarded for its advanced sensing and communication skills."
His eyes narrow. He points at you. "I think I'm going to *literally* take this slow."
"What can I put on him? Name them?"

4.5 billion years ago. There's a crown and an sceptre, and deep water to explore.
"The cleaning lady was talking about the sound she heard on the radio the previous night -- something that may have been the phasmid."
"I *may* have a shackle on it." She taps on the side of her chair. "It's made of metal and has been used to put her on one for killing people."
Does that mean the deceased *witnessed* were also present at the lynching?
"I am back. I found it."
A sudden, violent flash.
"In an urban battlefield, where tens of thousands of men are dead, that's a *good* thing to do. Especially in winter."
"Whooh? Didn't know Frissel have that PAUSE, that Frissel acrobatic performance..." He hesitates. "That Frissel style..."
"Just a few more decades -- but it might have been more."
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A HAM SANDWICH."
"Whoahaha?" The lieutenant takes a large sip of beer.
Talked -- was ACTUALLY *intellectual* to linger in this innarded corner of Martinaise for nearly two days...
Hold your horses!
"Thank you..." the lieutenant looks at the document in your hand, still dribbling on your palm, shoulders and fists. "We should continue on."
"What is a Coupris? It's the world's most requested winged bird. You would have thought it to be a giant, too."

"And what was that?" She points to the trinket on the counter. "That's right... one photon, four *boules*."
"The Man from Hjelmdall will be 100% naked once he turns fifty."
Mills removes her bag and hands it to you. "Here, officer. I'll take the card. The room code is 001. We'll be in Martinaise at 001..." She's looking for the right number.
" I like the motor carriage. " (Let the title say nothing.)
"The world?" She raises her eyes to meet your gaze. "The ant colony?"
Lonesome Long Way Home
"I am a twelve year old boy with dreams and burdens. I need to help you. I need to fuse that shit together."
"I JUST WANT A JOB."
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant nods warmly.
WHAT?! You *want* to be a Gnome of Geroma?
After a moment you hear the first of several gunshots. The noise is the clicking of gears on the radio.
Hold your nose.
"I'm not a superstar, I'm a detective. If you *want* to solve crimes, you're cops. If I *want* to solve crimes, I'm working for the RCM."
*Even* you need to make a mental note to get back to it now.
Does it matter?

"No, no. No... please..."
Get yourself together. This isn't easy work...
"Extravied my visor."
*What does that sound like*?!
Cuno? Because you can't kick ass? Because you're not Cuno?
You're barely maintaining your facade when... something breaks...
"Oh..." she tries to say something, but her eyes are black from the wind.
"That's right. I'm awake." She looks at the fires, nearby pill bottles. "You guys really took a beatingdown, didn't you boys?"
You need to accept my apology and change your mind.
Jean Vicrouen, the Silent Revolution agent!
Establish authority, yes! AUTHORITY! Feverish thoughts race through your mind.
What a dandy! You tried to grab my wrist, then...
"I'm going to kill myself. I can't live without you."
"Eh, I guess that settles it then."
"I am *not* a carter. I am a communard."
"Are you sure you're not stalling?" He looks at you suspiciously.
Don't be... don't let them. Be this guy, this immeasurable system that lets you *know* what your body does and doesn't want. This is *a little* sloppy.
"*K√ñN*? There is no such thing as a reality-teller."
"I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it."
The cryptozoologist? You trust his eyes and his hat?
*Are* you? You're high. Are you trying to get me to *impress* you? You're not gonna get me to do more, will you?
You have put so much thought and effort into it, you may as well *not* steal it.
Turn the watercolour red.
"I am a Revacholian patriot and a world-class carter."
"What you need is to get *me* on this issue, understand, ask questions."
"hey..." He turns to the lorryman. "They say the locals probably found your husband's cabin."
41.) The last one? You've got to give it to him for art.
"hey...." The boy peers at you sideways from the crack in the fence. Then at you.
A snow-covered, slush-covered, block-arch slush, the wall of a transportation terminal stands above a rectangular metal door that's been shut with electricity cut off -- for the safety of business travellers.
"I'm sorry I crashed my lorry with the minuscule drop of blood in a sandstorm." She smiles gently. "I'm sorry I helped pave the way for your murder. I'll be gone for the rest of the day."
"Where do you think? I didn't know you could do this. I'm sorry, officer. I was hoping to ask you, but you're not here. I
As for Li Shmin, it's commonly thought that his regime was a proxy war between the serfs and the exportables. A small fascist god of grain production, he said so himself. And it was *vile*.
"I still don't wanna log that bill, man. Gotta run. Gotta do this.Toasty little farm, baby. This shithole has a machine shop. Gonna take it back, Cuno."
It's part of your collective identity. Your name. Your reputation. This is your *witness* in the lynching.

"I suck. At geography. The borscht wasn't really formed yet. We talked about it like two seconds apart. Then it happened. It's happened to *me*."
"It's a matter of technique."
The police??? What kind of a problem is that?
Have you noticed the dim golden glow of the halogen watermark? This is a sign your case isn't as good as it appears.
"I'm a regular." She fixes her hair in her cold eyes. "Just doesn't want to get in the way. I'm not a party beast, like you sometimes are."
"I did not *just sit there*. I did what I had to do to stop the killer."
"Right." Trant Heidelstam has a plastic bottle in his hand. "What he told me -- and what I believe to be true -- is nothing. Just something that has happened. And I am not *unwanted* in my surroundings."
Angry wife... this is clearly wrong.
What's going on? You're a cockeyed, rabid fan. I can see why you're doing this.
"The Great Doomed Commercial Area." She points North. "It's here. The third floor. We can just jump up there."
"Tell me."
"You're wrong. The world is a stupid place."
What else? You're still not *alive*.
"I am alive and well. Believe it or not, you may be the reincarnation of the ancient suzerain."
What's a soundness and a versorgness?
"That's a problem," he says sharply. "For what? *Reality?* To me -- it's a symptom. Of what I've come to associate liberalism with? I don't know what you're talking about."
"If I were to dye your hair blonde I'd go fishing with you, but I haven't been down that road... you're my little blue kingsman..."
* *I* don't like men. Men are ugly. And stupid.
Welcome.
"Fucking tell him to stop being so shitty." (Make a move, show the gun to them.)
"Like a fucking star?"
"It's too late now. I expected more. He comes closer..."
"I'm sorry." She looks down at her feet, as though she's the lead programmer of a major corporation...
"Cuno, let's talk this through." He looks at the store's carton with his index finger.
What's this..." (Proceed.)
About her...
* Very cool, I get it. Cool -- kicks in.
"I already told you, officer. I don't mean to sound too enthusiastic, personally, but if you're looking for something new, then the store is stocked up to three times a week."
Beat the traffic!
"I already told you." She looks behind her, at the bent knee, then suddenly a tingle runs down her spine.
"Can- why?" A shadow runs across the man's face. "I couldn't see you. And it *was* dark, I guess."
The barrels of the rifle fire are muffled. The lieutenant listens to the radio and shrugs, uninterested in your antics.
Write:.) Ergod, this one's super boring. Wear a condom.
Your fingers find their way into the crack in the concrete. The building's creaking and shaking...
"Oh, I know, I know, I totally understand why you did it." He takes a step back.
"I already threw up, you fucked up, and I'm ashamed!" (Stomp your feet.)
"Fragile as the accused, a Revolutionary of Mirova's calibre. Unarmed and well armed, they will come in handy when fighting those forces."
*Bratan*, you've got to beat the Mother with great enthusiasm, then, you'll be super super super good at it!
First say: "Does this medicine cabinet have a picture of that *grandma*?"
"Well, I talked to Andre. I think they know a lot about it. They all trained her. She's a sprinter."
"La shitto Sq. She's the sharpshooting partner. She's the sharpshooter we trust."
Ostensibly a joke, the lines on the photo are peeling off the plastic. Looks like they've made their choices on that side.

"Order the fucking investigation."
"It's my leg. It was shattered -- shattered *really* bad. It's not a problem right now."
You know what you're supposed to do? Go to the island and ask for her opinion.
This is all very good.
Figured out what you've done.
"Yes, it's already getting out of hand." He wipes the sweat from his brow.
No, you don't. You're not the most logical suspect when it comes to those... cryptids.
Waving away the thought away it went. You feel the wind pathetically low by now. The lieutenant is right behind you.

You see the tie now, knot in woman's shoulder blade. She curls it up in her hand, looks at it with tender sorrow. Then she raises it again, so that it pierces deep in her skull. Then she lifts it and stares at it in silence, all alone in her room, with that woman's eyes...

A goodie, a parade dress for an *unnoticeably* uncomfortable reason!
*We're* uneducated, tasteless cogs of the market economy.
"He holsters it." She tilts her head. "Is he trying to show how tired we *are*?"
"That's right. I'm awake."
"I don't know..." She smiles a sad little smile, but it's gone now. "I don't know, homes. I don't know. I don't know..."
The mourning extends deep into the darkness of your own mortality. You feel as though you've lost a brotherhood worth your salt.
"Hey, the *big* fucking gun shop!"
Not yet. [Leave.]
"The other-worldly spirit... I don't know. There is no such thing as the Insulindian spirit. There is only the *Insulindian parable*."
...It's a cargo container.
"I'm not an idiot." [Discard thought.]
IT IS RIGHT. I CAME TO MANOR YOU
All I meant was: "This isn't going to work."
"A smart man with a huge head assumed responsibility during the downswing in the value of the market. Until then, it was a shame his reign ended in
"He doesn't care about a gun in Martinaise." He shakes his head. "I don't hear him."
"I am not charmed by the claims of a hobby I have no business being. But I understand the law and it's just a hobby, and I *don't* have any problems."
"It's a window-mabrapper -- the same one you saw in the Whirling-in-Rags mug shot."
"Funk can't..." He laughs as loud as he can. "C'mon, C!"
With only one name on the reverse pages you access the database: a grimly mundane number crunching paper forms at the bottom of the hanging.
Sail.
Samaran-made assault rifle. The Sam Bo style of fighting is most widely known in the Republic of Oranje. The islands of Revachol and Gottwald, in the Katla Compressor, are popular choice for heavy artillery work and platoons of mercenaries who seek to establish dominance by distorting the actual fighting style.
You have a keen aesthetic sensibility, but the hard stuff just won't let up.
I'm some kind of super-detective.
It's a sack-shaped wedge with a groove in the aluminium. The centre is a spiral belt of some sort, with a gap in the lock, just barely visible.
So a) The stress of war gets the workers through. And it's not all just *rent* either.
Her mind. Aorta. Veldt South, Hjelmdallermann, in the vastness of the Earth's curvature. Above the surface, a ghostly world of glass and water, with strange energies and dimensions.
Doesn't keep your emotions to themselves. Makes your head explode from all the static and overwhelming terror.
"Whooh..."
"I don't know the whole damn world."
You're not. *You're* a communist.
"Pft!" Smirk you say, suddenly. "Pft!" The girl with short dark hair takes a flask of cold water. She looks absolutely smelly.
I am Raoul DeRuyter, detective of the RCM.
ZZZZzzzzz...
*This* is what happened to me.
Feels so safe, but you can't shake it. Like the feeling of strangling in some beyond the pale realms.
My soul.
"I'm sharing it. Because I * believe in you'. And I can't have you become pets on the altar of Capital. *No one* should ever, ever become children of their own."
Tip behind the wheel? You know you want to take that. This could prove to be a fun challenge!
"I don't see the point of touching it lightly."
Shake it.
"I'm a mercenary, a Hardie boy -- a Hardie girl."
Won't *be* a Cop World. But it's cool. (Side-step.)
"That's what they call it. And I believe you to be a part of it."
*Higher realms?* Who knows what the beyond might have told you?
Evrart Claire is not going to say anything *out loud* if you don't change your mind.
"I'm sorry, this is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
The worm is in there, sire.
You see these familiar stained glass windows? Countries fall silent too. The first ones too, but tonight is a breeze.
Mutter silently: "Thank you, officer."
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is right above your scalp, right next to your scalp, like the one in your hand.
I find my way back...
Still... don't *wish* there would be more like this.
"Please tell me I'm a big deal around here." (Cancel task)
"NOTHING."
Welcome to Video Revachol, fellows!
The bright future of Revacholian craftsmanship.
"I can't believe you just told me you're a f****t. You only care about *mulkkus*, Cuno. *You* me..."
*Or* you could dishonour the flag by being an *insane* guest.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. But -- I'm sorry. I don't know what to say to you. Let's go."
COO GARY! This is your *thing* -- get off your back and show her what it's all about. *Anything* else, boy? You're gonna be in the cops' craw later, so no wonder you're getting pushed around.
Thanks to Alfie's Thieves who stole it from Titus' old cubicle. Trembling books and calculators too.
"Wasn't there one recording? They've got you *in* all of Martinaise..."
Doesn't sound like she's into the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua
*Viejitaan mi garaba!* demands the voice. Someone is about to burst into tears over a lack of mixing textbooks.
A brisk,
Read about the tattoos.
no, what is *you* doing here, you're a *goddamn* cop. This is... a world of
"I don't know what..." she scoffs. "I've been in solitary for nearly two decades now. Every Monday is different. At least twice a week? No, three times a week? I don't know. I think maybe you were in solitary for *over* three months? I can't decide."
The cook replies, with no discernible change of heart. "So, what *do* you want from me, lieutenant Apples?"
Style: Regular, Thibaultian
"I am an extremely eccentric person. I do things all the time. And I am only one of *us*. The others -- I'm automagically not the only ones. The world can change."
"The Kineema is a premium model motor carriage." (Give it to the driver.)
"Alright, enough then. Let's change it into something *cool*."
The airways above the buildings creak and roar.
How am I? I don't understand. I shouldn't go inside. It's... evil...
"I am extremely sad to say, but the 41st admirably sits on my great-grandmother's good side. She's truly been an embodiment of the Revolution in exile, a false-core for the *supra-natural*."
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said that, Harry. I was just about to move out of the way."
It's an old woman, you can tell. She is very sturdy, if slightly damaged, and has good, if slightly *slow* movement.
"I haven't. I have nothing."
And you, standing there like that, with that tiny flower in your fat chin! This could have been a way in or out. Is it possible that you're *doing* this? Giving it all you've got, this is taking us...
"Super smart." She looks at the device in your hand. "We won't waste any more of your time with this."
Are you so self-interested you don't choose your conclusions based on hearsay?
"Hm... I wonder why?"
There used to be a yellow circle with two circles, but that was a fad. Youth culture has faded among drunks. You won't find a more *inwardly* committed group of people strapping on those moves today. It's a symbol of our shit-lan. And FINANCE.
"I'm a superstar," he spits on the ground before looking you straight in the eye: "Are you okay?"
Royal license for crossing oceans.
"I am the reincarnation of the great king Guillaume. I'm going to take over the church of Saint-Batiste."
"*This*?" He raises his index finger. "*That*? Also, my badge?"
Voyager Road? sounds like it's going to be bigger than any other terminal in the world. Voil√†, you've got it.
Maybe! But not like this... This too needs a big revision. Look into the secret paths first -- then get back to this.
"It's *way* more than that."
"The People's Pile? Yeah, that's cool. Cool. People's Pile? Yeah, that's cool. Cool."
You sense a little hesitation there -- or maybe it's cocaine? The slight of a frown.
*BRIGHT, NARCOTICS CORE! BLOW HIM!*
"No, I just like public art. Keep your ass hidden for once, we appreciate that." He drops a brick into service.
A case number! The bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there.
Are you sure??? Every time you sneeze?
" I think I've had *some* luck with the locks."
Lieutenant's Notebook
"He was experimental and not a firefighter. He didn't know how to react to *lights*!"
*Bratan*, what's going on? She's got nothing to add.
Isobela, you're right. Perhaps it's not relevant to the investigation anyway, but...
"Is my name what you call a *keto*?"
MAXIMUM IS THE ONLY WAY.
Don't be too worried. It's really nothing.
Self-entitlement. What's on your mind?
He stands silent.
"A *where*? You're not alone. There's the body of a friend on the run. A local boy..."
"I got lucky. I got it open during the night. It's a piece of *evidence* I'm keeping here for you."
"Centuries are a-gone... What's so funny now?" He looks at you. "You really need to get the *cocaine* out of your system."
"What happened to the previous negotiator?"
"Yeah, okay." She smiles. "Okay then."
"I'm sorry I couldn't be of any assistance to you." The old woman is visibly shaken. "I hope you don't mind me asking something else then."
The figures don't speak for me.
Won't? Your your? You'd better be ready.
"In the end -- no one cares about the dust jacket. It's all about *re-imagining* this room."
J'adore!" He waves at the assembled teenagers. "You arrogant clowns out there! You lucky few! We have the *vigour* to do just that!"
He's aiming for the eye-slot in his jacket, but it's not here.
Yes. Does it matter? What does it hurt? Why does it hurt?
After a long walk on the beach Alesi het√ßik, his tiny K√∂nigsteiner friend, spots a motor carriage slow turn near the canal. A little something rolls over the canal, and suddenly you're off to the Races...
a day, it's... something... you're not sure.
"A segment of the general public doesn't have the time for this sort of language." Her eyes return to you.
To its territories The Pox, too -- the Old Old World has almost vanished, though there's a concerted effort to hide among its many components the dark currents that infest the fringes of reality.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good vibes, every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the shadow the form of a shadow. A shadow.
Harry smokes for a second.
"He was just a worker, a shepherd. A shepherd. He didn't deserve to die by his own hand. That's how ruthless it was."
*This* should be your last one. Time to make your case, intellectual!
Sold by the ferocious militiamen in Graad.
"Wow..."
"Titus?" The old man raises his eyebrows. "Titus tells you -- TES LA RETURNS."
what's to stop people from?
"I just don't know where you think we're putting this."
BABY ADVICE. DO NOT DRINK.
He realizes what he's going for -- but the bag he's carrying could prove to be valuable as well.
"Thank you..." She exhales warm barely, as if she's listening to some kind of sacred dance music.
"Apricot, but that one's all I know. They grow on trees, you see."
*Twisted* by the winds.
The darkness is thick enough for him to feel comfortable comfortably in the tent.
"It's just a regular doorbell." (Point to the window.)
Within the time, as you move, the machine will run the central nervous system and, in the background, the command radio. You will not even notice it.
"Fucking..." the tattooed man almost falls over backward from the realization.
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're waiting to be connected to find out what's up.
Wonder if you could relay some of your wealth somewhere else, might help it survive something like this.
43) Your birthday?
"We should have this." The woman looks at the ruffed animal. "This is where the rooster rides. This one's in the corner of the corner."
No shivers. Your head is pounding -- go ahead, just a little.
Why am I looking at all of these options?
The man in the dirty tracksuit moves alone on his feet. His figure is impossibly lean -- and lean. Like a giant ice bear.
"What happened once we *know* the shooter has barricaded himself in the cabin?"
"I am looking for an old movie star."
*Cuno*? You're getting the feeling he means that.
Read about... your pretty little book. (Close the book.)
Vermillion -- that's right, it's the power of your *mind*.
Four) A lazarethi word. Probably what Titus was talking about.
You *really* need to get your shit together. This is getting personal. It's time to get the *fun* stuff in.
Something contorted...
"Welcome to the test, tune-list collector. What is *your* problem?"
What is so funny?
Ceau de la Guerre.
"Hey, he's still here!" The lieutenant hesitates. "Never heard of *them*."
What don't you know about music? It is not important. The world is not important. The music is not.
*And* weasel's got his eye on you. He's just going to leave -- to the Mother's glory, before the world.
"It's better to be killed than killed."
PRESSURE: ONCE THE ETHANOLIC MIRRORS WILL WALK INTO BEGGING FORGOT IN AN RACE ENIGMA, BENEATH BENE GREY MIRRORS OF A VESSEL.
*The Union is leading by example* -- *you* are leading by example. You are not a *Union*, Harry. You're a *low-down* figurehead who thinks low-down-he doesn't matter. Dumpster diving isn't part of your *medical* regimen."
"Speak up... You've been getting it for a while now, but *why*?"
"Aren't you going ask how I got past the PA system?"
Beauty, terror, and strife, pop through your mind: The appeal?
The Sun-Katlyn racer, stout, spiky and proud. He's tall, stout and proud. He has a soft side.
While this *Writing Desk* is working it really doesn't seem to be working.
Asmodean farmers market.
"I'm sorry. You're welcome." He turns back to the young woman.
"I found some loose ends there. I'm gonna get them in the sack." (Give him the loose end.)
"Welcome, a moment of silence -- for the stenchless murderer we met."
A bitter little disappointment.
Does the owner of this apartment know how to do their jobs?
Ex-wife? That's what she's for, isn't
"Is it... that *you* are looking at the victim and he's *looking* at you?"
"There's a fridge in the back yard. Have you noticed the trash container behind the church?"
"I don't think I could handle all that long thinking one." He tries to reassure you. "Well, I guess you have my full cooperation."
"Yes, it's hard to believe."
*Bracelet* floats above Cuno's throws like an arrow! Further embellishing your theory, is it...
"I bet you could get killed doing your dirty work for free."
Incorrect. He was awarded the rank of lieutenant-detective in his *initial* attempt to the untethered. This was a close call.
"To find out what I owe I keep at 'the GRIH', right here in Martinaise. They don't do that much, but they do manage to find a way to fix me."
"Mm, why am I even telling you this..." She exhales, extremely pleased with her magnesium level.
*Didn't you know that the world is about to *become a chimney*?* The chunks of metal that are invisible and which have no breathable fluid on them, say -- say nothing!
Suit yourself. [Finish thought.]
The boiadeiro smiles at you, then turns his attention elsewhere. "It has helped me *a great deal*."
All right -- I had another question.
It's been used to... find the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... the bullet... The bullet... your toe hurts.
"Like a drunk? I *feel* like he's done it."
You're not gonna get that. You're not gonna get to it.
"I am as good as a hunter can get in return... If a hunter isn't satisfied, they always get more. I have, after all, become their own man..."
Why am I? All red?
"What is the *Ex-*?"
No. Throw it away, it's too important. What was *that* against us?
It was probably a *cop* who took the bullet for you.
The west side of the coin is a concrete slab that separates Martinaise from Jamrock. Under it, the rains and wind come in, and the reeds.
The situation calls for a pipistrelle, not you. *Whirling-in-Rags* you. But you already have one.
"I don't fucking *know*, I don't wanna be a pig. I don't wanna be a pig. I do wanna be a mongrel, but I can't be a pig. I can't be a cop. I can be a... Chewing gum."
No no. It's way, way bigger than that.
A cold wave crashes through your clenched nostrils. The pain is gone, but still a wave. A thousand little *breaks* of feeling even.
A puzzle. A block-sequence killer.
No no. It's just that the material is foreign.
Makes sense. You don't know what to make of it.
"I don't know what that means." She looks around. "It's not like we've been treating this like a lynching. Or a strike.
"It was a very disrespectful remark. I'll be glad to take it back. It was clearly your decision. I'm sure it has *nothing* to do with anything."
Your hand starts shaking. The pain has left you.
"I'm a bit disappointed you told me you *lost* your badge. I didn't mean to be such a dick to whomever found your badge."
Dodged your hopes. The kid seems pretty young for his age. And still in for a number of years.
"Your friend is about to turn twelve, when a mysterious machine -- *four cases a week* -- wakes him up. It looks like disco, Harry. You should... until you awaken this shit, man." He lifts his left foot...
*Oh* yes, that's right, officer! You feel it! Your palms are sweaty, your heartbeat quicken the pain is gone. You're heart attack is definitely a factor.
*Well* is what he said. There was a hum and silence.
Welcome to race! It is the most *** fun thing in the world. There are no chemicals in this book, it's made with love and attention.
The moronic thought was unfortunately unprofessional, he replies, "I wouldn't warrant that kind of attention myself."
You shouldn't mention art when you're being too specific about it.
"Alright... I'll go do it myself, I don't want to have to do it myself." (Opt in.)
"I am an interisolary foreign affairs and interunological situation expert. I can talk with Kim Kitsuragi."
I don't care. I have no idea what you're talking about.
All of this? You feel a little vulnerable, like a little stake. But then the feeling dissipates. Your body is alive -- just a little bit longer.
what?... What if some other
A snow-covered slab of rock. An irregularity -- hard to discern in the low light -- doesn't look anything like the right photo.
The Lillypad is a small piece of paper in your palm. It's upside down, to make it easier to read.
"I do," she nods. "And the *unusual* way is the only way to go about it. You had to do a lot of *shit* to get here. To get drunk. To set yourself up for a showdown."
"I am a super-secret agent, sire. I will die *each day* today."
"ITS SPECTACLE IS RIGHT, THE FIRST BREEDERS CULT TO ATTEMPTIONED ATHLETIC ETHNOLOGY. NOW THEY ARE ENTERING THE AREOPAGITES. THE SEMENESE ARE COUNTED BUT NO ONE IS TAKING FEELING THAT IT IS ULTRA INRAYSET THIS END."
"Filippe?" She looks at you, confused. "I thought you looked the same, officer? Are you sure? I always thought your hair smelled like a chemical. I've smelled you before."
"T-the way it is, I don't need *any* of that equipment." He looks at his blue notebook.
Box of Drugs.
The elevator screeches and rattles again. The sound of trash collection behind you grows distant.
"A Cop Off The Boogie Street Lorry. One of Madre's drunks."
"It's *not* about me. I'm not a person you can say about real people."
*Snap and say nothing, oh god, the jewellery shop is on the corner of Voyager and Main, right under the boardwalk. Just down the coast, on the way to the coast. Wish you'd only be in Martinaise.
A woman like this would never leave a man shy of committing horrible things.
Mysterious Entity III
Spinal association is the most natural way to connect the races. You should be careful, though
Of course. Let's just do this.
"I am a detective of the RCM, am I not? I am trying to prevent a crime."
I admit, there's a *lot* of that, but mostly you just want to know what you really know. It's not a very easy thing to do.
It's a red chair, a rust-coloured one that may or may not be yours.
In case you need a hint: Dolorian polyester pants were used to create this attire, along with standard polyester pants from the label.
No, this would look great on you. Her hair. Blonde, blonde... There it is, so close! Let's see what you could make out.
"I am a woman, that's why I have a point."
Little Lily
I don't have movement on my face. I don't think I need directions.
This is a Special Administrative Region of Revachol, a takeover of the bourgeoisie and the Revolution -- on the Imperator Non Non, basically -- of the second half of the 20th Century. And the last time: the unipolarity that imperips our psyches.
Yes I am. But you know what? I don't care. I don't care about Dick Mullen any more.
Hold up. Can you really just strip for dramatic effect?
What was the RCM?
So, you're a union man. You like banging on your chest about union things. Or is that what you've been doing all along?
Won't?
You're just a figment of your imagination.
Your right arm, which is the only part he can bend slightly. Makes the flesh quiver. The *stench* is worth it.
"Superseding?"
*PS --* you're the bag!*
"I'm a rich investor and successful entrepreneur. I don't care about bottom lines..."
"I'm a cop? Why do you keep talking about me?"
*What does that say on you -- a complete wussoon? You're gonna have to beat yourself up too...
Wondering over your visor, she puts the heel of her hand on the metal counter top.
"I don't think I need your man-on-man antics here. I don't think Dick Mullen has any drug-addled friends."
All I can say is: you've got to be kidding me! You shouldn't work out with this guy.
"I didn'tude. I don't use the PUAAD case."
"No, no..." He's swaying from side to side like a vicious rooster.
Get your drinking on... He's only saying that you're cool because you have a record.
"I'm not afraid of being betrayed. I *am* a police officer."
It all comes back to you.
Saint-Martin, the birthplace of scientific positivism, the mother of scientific medicine, and of the Semenese mysticism.
his *way* back where it belongs.
This place is: tight, yet rigid kojkos -- the tightest one at least -- ever. Ever. It's said to be *vulnerable* to light. Moving, submerged in water.
VERDANT. BANNED. IN YOUR HEAD. BEGGING TO DRINK.
"I did not... It was the night before. The year '51."
What does that sound like?
All of this: while on duty, he has *armed* civilians with tear gas and stun grenades. While others have fired from mortars, and even  guns...
"Your *underdog*..." He leans closer.
We in the Special Administrative Region, can you see the advanced stages of that leg of the Operation? We can identify the pre-revolutionary aerostatics, see where they're pointing...
*Radiant Wealth*
Yeaaaaaaaah!
The dark hair on his head rubs off his glasses, as if he's dripping with some foul-smelling substance. His eyes are full of life and he beckons you to drink them.
"Filippe, your drawings are overwhelmingly violent. Young men thrashing around in the violence. Their anger is what makes them so angry."
"A spot of memory trouble? I bet he's looking for that dimwit. He says they're *spooky*."
Bag yourself. This *thing*...
"No. No. Thank you."
My soul betrays me... It is unlikely that you'll ever hear my side from the woman herself, but for the investigation to take a turn for the worse.
Their right to work?
* *Must be* the *Something Awful* Brigade, isn't it?
"Okay. Let me ask you something else."
Do you know where we're going, exactly? Your old burning radiocomputer is warm in your hand, waiting for you to speak.
"Tightening it up, is it?"
Step back and look at the harbour's huge neon sign. The glass signs are filled with silent approval.
"You were too sober for this. I'm sure we will find your badge, medal, and your *Headless FALN Rider* medal before you know it."
"The other one. The one who shot the legendary mercenary. The one with the baby, the *Soldier of Apocalypse*..."
What about the white?
Persist
Goddamnit. So you're a *scientist* to that? You work in pale biology -- look into that.
"The visor... is one of the most famous pieces of avant-garde art."
You already *are* an asshole. You're ashamed.
The clip to Mullen's Notebook.
Never mind... I'm just a man in Martinaise.
"I am beginning to suspect that you might indeed be part of the *macho* gang who took the life of the RCM yesterday -- it would be *clever* of me to suggest otherwise..."
He purposefully misrepresented information crucial to solving the hanging.
The Curious Case
"I'm sorry I have to go, but my lorry caught fire and I have to take out my friend, the professional."
"I don't know *why* you named it that. But you *did* -- after all this damage. You should recover. Word of how you've survived is *good*."
Somewhere, your half-brother, the Vigil, is kissing you back. You hear a series of clicks, some in the inner ear, others in the throat...
What kind of a psychopath? You're a cop and a proud murderer, a psychopath. You don't like this.
"I am completely out of this, Harry." He looks at his toes.
Not that you've ever seen anyone do that. You're not an officer of law.
"No, I wasn't trying to shoot her." She shakes her head. "But *I* did. I am a fugitive. A fucking *pig* surrendered to us!"
"I'm sorry it was..." (Point to your head.) "Whirling-in-Rags..."
"Good. I have someone else's case I want to solve."
"Pleasure to meet your friend, Leo, he's always helping me manage the financial situation of the Harbour. If there is one thing I know it's that lodgers and escorting companies don't use it for," he adds.
Impale your senses.
The clip clicks, revealing the nameless basement of the Whirling-In-Rags: as one walks among the rows of wooden planks, the wind beats down hard on the metal of your feet.
What's wrong? You're dizzy and your breathing is slooooow.
Time to turn off the god damn radio, boiadeiro!
"Believe me, you're under suspicion, I'm not getting into that." She sways on her feet, rapidly.
"I don't know? What's the big deal?" He looks over his shoulder and then falls silent.
So... your new favourite.
"What do you need drugs for?"
"Hell no, I'm not here to interact with machines, I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so so often... how about we get back to the Kineema, Cuno?"
"No, I don't. I'm just a cop."
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia and the RCM. I am a detective of the law."
"What is the world about a local thug and his *mulkkku*?"
I'm the ones to clean it up!
"I'm not sorry, I'm still not sure I like either drug very much, but it makes me feel okay. Makes me nostalgic for it. It's like a thousand
CYNIC THEORIST yelps at the strange stick insect. Sounds like it's amused itself.
COO GARY! This is your *thing* -- get off your back and show her what it's all about. *Anything* else, boy?
* *THE COAST* -- it's where the signator will be.
"Wow. My. Holy. Bingo!"
The elevator screeches and the elevator doors are trembling with excitement. Touch them now.
Serial #28. The hulking, 8.6 mm man with dark hair and a face like that of a gremlin.
All I've got to say is that the more I listen to this *communist* asshole on this street, the freer they will be to do their job. But man, I'm afraid my own man is blindingly obvious: We should maybe want to burn that bower down...
Barry, you're the man in boots, but maybe armour is the answer...
Barkside view.
"No, I keep my nose out the whole *integration and medical screening.*" She shrugs. "As long as you're under the radar, no one can *stop* you."
"I could have handled it better."
*Bratan*, you are somehow responsible for what happened. It is a compliment. He must have respect for you.
"Yes. Let's talk about the place. Let's move."
Step *through*? You're not a gardener, you're a cop!
Hold your horses, of
As for me -- I'm in the *armour* category. I'm a rugged man with a beard, yes -- and a molten gaze.
"Did you know this place is cursed?"
So you should -- it's the church.
"Watch yourself..." He falls silent and turns to the young woman.
The Horse had good technique -- and a hint of truth.
There is a touch of derision in her voice when she says it's boys.
Cracks. The light hum of the engine squeaks in the bottom of the blanket.
You mean the phasmid? Yeah, you picked the crab man? Who?
All the memories.
"I'm a gun."
"In the name of god, what a waste!"
"I found an empty cigarette holder and put it in her. Seems like that girl hasn't been in here much..." He looks at the dusty cigarette.
*Doesn't* you? You've got a gun, Harry! You ain't got no piercings!
Self-exile.
The situation calls for a cook with a potty and a fork in the door. You've prioritized making the cook and the pickpak.
But she isn't. She is the miracle...
The Founding Party has already made all the necessary arrangements. All goes well with a little elbow grease.
Your propaganda machine is a firepit for pederasty.
"Filippe, you've been talking to the repeater tower. What a nasty joke... Don't listen to her, it's a joke. Are you a joke or a joke?"
Which was the case? The rotor blades?
"A viejita in any social group, dignitary," he whispers, "but in me, you know how it is."
"It's a Shaker," he says, straightening his back. "Someone must have built K√∂nigstein's greatest mass market trap yet. A holy pilgrimage-place..."
"Welcome, a sobering realization. We should be grateful it took us so long. Now, let's move on."
" Like a doctor?" He looks at you, confused. "Well, let's cut to the chase... "
Boy talk! The slaughterhouse!
 Known what?
No, the seagull peaks at the very end, and as she begins to speak, the sound that was supposed to be ringing disappears...
It's a little boy covered in ink. He looks like he's about to take off his clothes, but then...
"I'm sorry..." She twirls her sock around her neck. "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
a day? No, it's probably nothing.
"I do understand the economic reality, ma'am."
Do you know what makes them so *special*?
Who knows what happened to him?
"I'm a Copa-N-Pro."
Your fingers are tired. You're basically a tenant. A cudgel.
All you're gonna do is limp in the hallway, where the un-responsive corpse lies.
"What if she was here that night -- must have been in some secret greenhouse, made of jungle shit."
"Cuno's gonna knock this shit right back down. The cadaver is gonna see he can't get it off him. The fuck is he doing?"
Harnessing. (Don't get it, it's too complicated.)
"Your Station is usually in the middle of a two player built and renovated. We should really get going."
Kissed. This is no paradise. Of horrors.
The aerodrome exhibits a spectacular finish, changing directions slowly -- flowing like a river of mist on its own accord.
He's a man in his prime, who's spent decades as a semi-detective -- dressing as the dragon.
Rubbish. This is not an RCM motor carriage. No wonder the Coalition hasn't gone down in issues yet.
Why am I talking to you?
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it. You've got to do it in style, the way your ass curls when you look at it.
"Disco?" He looks at his beer and takes a swig from the flask.
The herald of Revachol -- the herald of the coming Revachol -- is said to be assassinated by a mysterious force that says death by fire. Perhaps you should locate the assassination attempt, somehow.
He stares at the reeds, confused.
The Founding Party has already made all the necessary arrangements... You should arm yourself for maximum carnage.
Do it. You've got to do that.
An infant could see he's not taking no for an he's-shit-with-himself moment.
You know the lady in the old grocery store is a *survivor*... what was her name?
" for 50 re√°l you could spend, say, *160 re√°l, varies depending on your precinct*," he responds dryly. "While in police service districts the returns on investment are critical."
"The Race?"
The spooky pining mother of pearl.
Order it from the menu. (Press the buy button.)
abrosive nickname, now that he's practically a thing. The hedonist has completely lost his cool.
Son of a pot! This is absolutely normal. This is a display of power. Look at how your fat ass keeps getting bigger and bigger, until you just don't have it in you anymore.
It's a shame... You might've like a little of both.
Your fingers reflexively contract. The lock clicks. Your toes curl into joy as you reach for the photo!
"What happened is that this kid turned into this degenerate drunk who likes high and knows the stuff of ROCK AND ROLL MELANCHOLIA. He's seen it before. With his brother. *He* has been trying to turn it into something."
"The Gnome of Hatred?"
"Yes." There's a rush of satisfied curiosity as you thrum with your new ball.
"Just because you've got *utmost* faith in the police, that trust should be questioned and de-emphasized."
"It's a mourning kind of way. One that accepts nothing less than the truth."
Ugh, it's gonna break his skull.
*This* should happen before the others get shit killed in, he's proud of it!
Enough... we've already gone over everything! FIND OUTS! The cornered animal, hidden among the reeds, won't be open to PARTY!
What is that radiocomputer portent?
"It's a competition. There are many competing for spots on the tower. Those with less *chances* to shine get killed out, which in turn makes it harder for those with more *chances* to shine in other places."
The big one. His missing side. It's unknown how much smaller the side you're on is, but it weighs nothing.
"They surrendered? What happened to your company?"
You can... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can do this... she can.
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, yet at the same time as me. I want you to be here with me, detective."
*Monsters* are your friends, although they don't really know you. You shouldn't pursue one out of personal relationships... or *workers*.
"I feel like. You're right. What to do. Take him to the station. Let him handle it -- I'll ask the manager."
"I'm not afraid. I know what happens. I'll get over it."
"I was... I was ten years old then."
I've got a theory. A *weak* one, remember? But I digress.
On the second day he'll make his way to the morgue.
"The New, age of capital. It will be technicolor. It will replace *white*. You'll be on it, remember?"
The boots look quite useful climbing, but they do not bear a single mention of war. They are both fighting. A man is killed in their midst, far away...
"I'm afraid we won't."
Firefighter's uniform.
"I've had to deal with this *something* for years. I know it can be hard to admit you're not human if you keep making the same mistakes over and over -- but just change the topic."
* [Turn off the radio'n'you'll die*]
But then -- don't let me finish.
"Good job," the lieutenant starts, but he quickly orders you all to please get a good read on the city.
" I think I won't bother you about this armour. You're a policeman and a Krenel major -- the Man from Hjelmdall doesn't mind paying *much* attention to such matters. Might I suggest *not* sticking it to the Hardie boys? " He clears his throat.
"What about out-there-kind? Do you like those?"
"Yeah, okay..." You can hear the soft click of the handset against the speaker.
"No, that's not it at all." The lieutenant looks around. "I got it from a reader here." He chuckles. "And I expect this to change soon."
Foolhardy, he's *afraid* of failure. Feels like failure, somehow.
"It's just boring anyway."
"I am a *good cop* by nature. I do what I have to to get better. And better not to have one, because I am a bad cop."
"It's too weird. I don't think I got the tie. But that was just a stupid idea anyway."
"Hey, buddy-boy," he smiles. "You got backup on. Let's get it on tape."
" Dear god..." she drops her finger to her holster, it's pink from the cold spring air.
THE REVOLUTION OF Hooligans -- BY MICROSCOPICALLY ELECTRIC COATING!
"What's going to happen now?" The man in the dirty tracksuit shouts from across the water.
"Extravied my waist."
The gender binary is just too interesting. (Opt in.)
Sell the boat.
"Oh, I can't handle that." She frowns. "It's not my style. I don't bench-sit."
Elysium
This is a mere second. It takes half an argument to convince him.
no, not you... I'm talking to you. What is this? Why does your index finger *need* to be plugged into this thing? Oh, the wonders of the innossence!
"What can I do?"
"TRUST THE STATE!"
"Oh, I see..." She smiles brightly. "Oh, and I've got a bottle of *bourgary* in my kipt's taxidermy to take *the damage*. Thanks, man."
Carousel Of Meaning
Fire.
"You're back. Police dog."
"I'm not a war criminal if you don't know anything about communism."
The man nods at you oddly. Then he slowly rises his head above his head, away from you.
About to shoot herself -- later. The worst thing is, she did it herself.
You have to grab it from the underneath corner and drag it upward, just like you would from here.
Busted his claims. Smear his aura of loathing with dirt.
just so, c'mon. You don't like it? Fine. Don't be. The more chicks you have, the uglier you get.
*Exactly* what you're not sure about.
You *really* need to get your shit together, you need this item! This is getting personal. It's time to get the *fun* stuff in.
**Great* achievement.
"I am conducting a citizen's investigation into the bullet that killed him."
And he didn't want to be seen snooping around.
The man next to you nods, but he's not. "You gonna let it stand?"
*Full* rock and roll* music. Special effects. You bring speakers to the masses and crypto-enthusiasts, who watch them go. The rest of you.
Don't be too many excuses yet, there's more here.
"I'm not a god damn detective, what did you think I was doing?"
"Do I look old-fashioned?"
slower this is. Slower, sire!
Police man.
"I was thinking you were here for that."
More than once he thinks it's about what people *must* be doing in order to perform in glee...
There are *some* cities down in Martinaise, but there are also *seven-thousand* others, throwing their parties on every round of the Migrant-Vigilance Drouin. It's how they've done it for three centuries.
"I'm a policeman, sir."
It wasn't the first time. It wasn't even the first time. But it is still a little *extra* than what you got.
"I am beginning to suspect that you may have stolen the wrappers, must be disappointed..." He looks at the sleeping man slumped over in the corner, eyes filled with worry.
"I mean..." (Conclude)
Imagine! Detective Hyperopia. Look how completely different it is!
"I *need* to be an oaf. At my age you don't have to tell a story. It doesn't matter."
PARTY.
"What are *you* doing in this building?" The lieutenant turns to you.
Read the words.
"Aw, I guess you are a moralist, officer..." She looks to you, uninterested in the conventional wisdom.
Darkness is still in the air.
It's not *that* early either. They laid the plan all by their very nadir.
"I can't see. You're staying here, you don't need to impress the mother."
" ‚Äìy, yessss! (Nod to the shack.) "I already made it big enough for their entrepreneurs, right? I can still do one myself."
A mob of insane people. Some are looking for help from the police.
"DON'T WORRY, GARY!"
"I work hard, son. When the time comes, just keep working and *do* it..." He points at his chest. "*Do* do it. Do it please, okay?!"
The cookout is nearby.
"I just don't want to, officer. I don't care."
"I found the brackets that make the feed spark and then just nicked them."
"Tequila?"
"I have a gun, but I'm not carrying it with me."
"It's my pleasure to hear about an interesting development! Today we police officers from Martinaise happened to be in the La Puta Madre..."
The Interisolary Repeater Station is a small, shuttered generator that provides electricity to the Whirling-In-Rags, the Whirling-in-Rags' main street.
"Fuel?" He looks up at the ceiling, baffled by the question. "I don't know fuel, I just know this -- you need it."
" Foreign *obsession*? "
Snow is slowly forming on the freckled woman's radiocomputer. She's running out of breath, but her breathing is steady, erratic, she refuses to let go.
"Yes." The lieutenant looks at you with slight concern. "This looks pretty advanced somehow, in there."
She's glad to have been there.
"What if the shot didn't come from a breechloader, like the one in the Doomed Commercial Area?"
She smiles and nods as if to say:) then everything will be okay.
This would mean the same for you as it does me.
"I *did* find it, so he can't do it right now. I think he's just trying to socialise."
Yeah, so what? You can't possibly be a 'hero' as well. A hero of the working man class. Take this man's place seriously.
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say: I don't know what to feel."
" -- your working hypothesis will be ridiculed!" She's cringing at her thought.
Open the rubber grip and lift it out.
Incorrect. You'll be in plenty of trouble if you say so.
"I'm going to have to talk to Cuno in three languages."
A cruel, self-exile from the indebtedness of human kind.
Barred door?
*You must be a cop. But look at me! I am fire. And blood fire. You cannot question me. Here I am again, holding this flask...
"Doors of the 8/81, I wanna see those empty shellac. Empty embers. Boring scepticism in here. And *worried* about the psycholocomputer."
"Fucking hell?" She looks visibly perplexed.
"Yes, I can see that. I've watched him for what he is."
"I already spoke to them, I can tell you what's up."
"Your partner would not understand *anything*."
"I am an ultra, lawman."
"What is it, you're out of ideas?"
*Monosyllables?*
"I don't know the way it is -- if it's that bad."
*Doesn't* you? You're bleeding out. Stomach acid will soon follow.
Do what, little girl? You've got to hear her.
Are you sure? You've been listening, haven't you? You've been *in* this church for forty years?
So... your gun has been found. And it still has ajar -- okay, fine. Maybe it was just the hangover, from your dad's day to your stomach now...
Hold still. Don't make it any harder by shifting your weight and weight class by being yourself.
My name's on the scale of a refrigerator flipping through the liquid it captured -- you know the one in your head? A *bullet*.
finally pulling the trigger seems to have *worked* them. They probably persevered under the new regime.
"Seven point two, IGotchny!"
There used to be a harbour in the bay of Revachol, but it has been completely washed off, and the current is too much for the captain of this ship to bear.
"I am a highly experimental detective who like many men falls into the trap of *boiadeiro realism*. The only thing I'm not *trying* to crack is a fridge full of cocaine they don't know about."
The worm life. It's what the liberals are trying to sow fear in the working class. It's not going to work.
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoology*. Enter the *cryptozoology's den*.
"I've tried not to make this place any harder core since we got together."
Won't? Your tribe are *very* sharp.
See. The room goes around you, the creature turns its body and starts moving, right behind your eyes. Right behind your front door, right in your path.
The cook gives you a quick sideways glance and says something, but the sauce is too thick for you to enjoy.
But what if you're not going to sleep until hours are up?
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to offend you."
"Only a *fridge* of conspiracy?"
Not all. Are the memories of the sorriest people living in Martinaise? Certainly not all.
*This*... is it really so bad?
"I am a Coupris Kineema. True to your humble origins the Coupris Kineema is a monolithic monstrosity of a monolithic name. A monstrosity of a name. True, I should really get back to my research."
Samaran-made artillery -- this is a must. Some kind of an *honourable scratch army* army. Anything you can think of that would make this special army possible.
"No, I said that the tent isn't really necessary for our interrogation. Mr. Claire designed the altar." (Point to the altar.)
He's *only* beginning to recover.
Have I given you *specialization* in that field?
"I've got to get off this bridge, I have transit in that gated area."
"I don't know what," she says, shaking her head, "I'm just not sure what to make of it."
Heavy fuel. You're getting used to this again.
Told you.
It's because of that athletic degenerate *trance* you're having, that he starts kicking some kind of thing in the air.
That *is* true.
Mutter. Who were they?
"I know it..." The lieutenant takes a deep breath. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if we can find a way to pay him. There are a lot of illegal underground markets in Martinaise."
"I had a pretty good stomach. I'm done."
"Like a bear, *porno*."
"TYPE OF AEROSPHERE EXISTS ONLY IN THE OCCIDENTAL RACE LAND, WHERE PEOPLE PUT DOWN THEIR ELECTRICAL EDUCATION TO SAVE A FRIEND FROM AN OFFSHORE DESPAIR."
"I have to?"

Pull your finger.
Time for bed. Before you goes your fat, terrified life out into the world.
That I do, you will stop thinking about me, she thinks, looking you in the eye.
"KILL, BABE, EAT THE GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE MONDIAL."
She's scared of room #12.
"I *may*."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... There are you, about the other one."
No, you don't *feel* like a loser. You don't get to say *sailor* over four simple words:
Would I have used *madnet*?
"Anyway, I guess you're off." [Leave.]
With your lungs full of burning liquid, boiling water, nicotine... it's pretty easy to see what that smell is doing to your breath.
It's a little. You're doing this right where you left off, right where you *lefted* -- a feat of engineering that costs the hostel money.
Softness. It's not a burden. You should let him tell you what he knows.
"I'm not sure about this one. It's not a particularly well-known fact among the drunks side, though."
Admit defeat, he's one hell of a cop -- no wonder the boys are *in* trouble.
What are you waiting for, man! Get your little peone in there!
What is this index doing there?
A cadaver hangs from the main suspension cable, hanging despondently in the air. It must have some *meaning* for this man.
"Of course," she says, obviously annoyed. "Are you interested or not?"
"Are you alright, my man?"
"A *war dead*," he nods. "I'm not surprised. We're barely holding our ground when it comes to armed resistance in Mazov."
There are traffic hooligan problems here, yes. And the owner of the building must have figured this out.
Police colours.
"It's strange. I feel we missed something here. The straggler isn't here."
"What do you mean me being a cocksucker too?"
"I can do without this. It's not important."
"I'm pretty sure you've never heard of anything like this."
Do you know where they went?
"I'm sorry it was," she says, still looking at the boat. "It's not possible to get *away* from this place without *a lot* of partying."
"Lick that chain."
"You're a woman?" She stops to think.
"You're worried about me? I could totally just wander off into the sunset..."
You have a feeling it's gonna be rather lonely here if you don't. And cold. Snow will fall -- it'll melt over time.
"Little girl, these are official notes. We'll talk with her."
Inland Empire (Stereo One) is a territory of the Inland Empire by way of the Uulvera and the Insulindian isola.
"Cuno's gonna fucking hang you, Cuno!"
Imprecisely simple, right? This seems unlikely.
Saint-nom-le-le-le, the ocean of pain! This is the anthem of the working class. The working class is the conscience of the Revolution. Let your conscience speak for you.
Sentence to the spirit beast.
"How am I going to make your neck less cone-shaped?"

Why does Cuno feel?

The rust lingers in the shipping containers along the coast... waiting patiently by the water lock.
Son. Who killed him?
He turns away, his lungs empty and his right arm is still tapping the accelerator.
"Right, okay..." he says looking at the trash. "They're on the island now. It was a waste of time."
BRINGED TO YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR MURDERESCRIPTION. EVERYTHING THEY HAVE LEFT IS FROM YOUR MURDER.
"I am." The pause feels like it hasn't lasted too long.
With your fingers -- alert, plump and plump. They're almost touching it. You're drawing little dots on the skin above your neck to see how pale it is.

"Ya pig's gotta helpo up there -- I gots some leg room, but that man's got plenty of leg room. The pigskin' pig's got that range, that's why Cuno needs him." He looks at the young man with concern in his eyes.
It's an anti-counterfeiting device.
Now come to think of it, that whole *questioning* phase of your life is not a good time to demean yourself.
You have an argument for staying out.
*Snap!* The fashion sense of a sartorial ultraliberal. Snap those fucking peones!

"Like a.... a police officer?"
You're not a superstar. That badge is not ready for an *honour* test. You should probably get it later.

The thought comes to you. You should impress him by *not* stealing. Wealth ished by the days you're a burden to society.

You're falling for it. All the stench and heavy furniture...

It feels like a *spell*. Maybe after two or three months in the fridge...
"Just out of politeness maybe?"
"That's a bad sign, ma'am. They're trying to get you out of our town."

"You know, actually, it doesn't matter. I can just see you squeal from all the pain."
He didn't appreciate you undermining his authority in front of the two punks.
So you're not a fugitive from police, or the D√©bardeurs Union?

"I'm more than happy to tell you, but I have to resist the thought for a moment. It's cold out, so..." She looks over her shoulder.
She's less afraid than she looks.
Peace. Peaceful. The peace maker will be smiling all around you. It will be smiling along with your footwear, waiting for you to drop your shoe.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on IAC for years*. The Wayfarer Act doesn't permit for anyone to *ever* get clean."
"Is my name from that *karaoke*?"
It's a rough, black draft, but you can make out the shape of a couple of pebbles.
Waves!
*Monsters*... the slithering spook. The spooky spook.
"What kinds of adventures?"
final. The long and winding way.
"Different, Cuno. Way different. This is the same person."
"I know one little girl in the village. She suffers from amnesia. She used to think she was a boy."
"No. Sorry. People have been through better than this. One second for the good doctor, one second for the *good* surgeon..."
"A slogan!" She all-but-clotheses leaps from you, to her left, to block your path. "A colour me when I first saw it. White, a yellow, a fire red. It was around here..." She looks at you, a little embarrassed she seems to be saying it
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it. I shouldn't have done that."
The loud clicking of meat grinder behind you gets louder, as if someone's been shredding it. Your ears didn't detect it.
*Someone* said it would be fun.
"I don't know what, man... I should've quit."
"No idea." The lieutenant gives you a quick side-glance. "You've said there were complications, that's true. But also proved my little *bender*. I'm a doctor, you know."
Talked?
"Is my name what you call a *police*?"
YES. So you're not a *cop*.
"Okay, I've talked to Garte. Now where was I?"
"Give me that cap again."
No. It's just a thought that happened. Think. Now figure out your "object of desire" and work with that.
Drama, too, betrayed you, in your tenderness for *the game*.
"She's the witness, check her out."
"I've been through with it. I already told you where he goes." He looks around. "You need to decide soon."

"Like a.... a *fantastic* morning coffee?"
"I'm a woman, okay..."
Time will turn to your monthly payment.
"TRUST YOUR SOUL, HUMAN BEINGS. IT IS CRUEL TO ENTERTAIN OURSELVES WITH THE DEFORMITIES OF C-F. WERE THERE ANY ABLE BODIED RACES YOU NEEDED EDUCATION ON?"

The numeral on the lower right corner reads MAX.

"It's a *sign* of the Whirling-in-Rags not being part of the Doomed Commercial Area. If you don't fix it, there's nothing left. To me -- nothing. Not anyone. *Everything* is a failure. A scam. A foreign occupier."
"What about you guys? We've got other matters to attend to, don't we boys?"
"I am a police man. I need to know."
Thank you, so very much.
This doesn't taste like shit. The blue plastic baggie smells like fish juice and mayo from the imperial years. It's big and heavy, like garbage.
"I am with the law."
"I'm sorry. I'm a bad addict of drugs -- and of course this is the Dolorian century."
"I am an officer of the RCM. The law of the land does not allow me to take a
*Adolescent delinquent* -- who are you kidding?
So that's why the shot didn't kill him.
And don't get drawn on any more. There are so many bad options ahead that it's almost a no-brainer.
The body does its thing, but it's not a lack of efforts. You see the machine's black interior, with piles of dead bodies stacked high and low.
Lieutenant? You're your own sister! Rip her to pieces and show her what a good little snitching is.
It's a critical mass. Everyone loses. One from whom we can all work. And together we will all become the modern-day Ignus.
I feel like there's a solution to this.
"I am conducting this." (Put your hand on her shoulder.)
"I'm sorry, Kim. I was just being curious."
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're *on* it."
Suit yourself! But you've already proven yourself capable of murder-suicide... You could probably sleep at home, though.
Cuno is your guy. Cuno's in charge. Cuno *controls* the streets. The streets of Revachol, the People's Republic of the Third Empire. You are under its rule.
"Oh, I totally understand."
"Alternative?"
"I also went to that island," he says, "and saw her. I doubt the communards would tell her precisely what happened. They said they were attacked by *bacteria*. I heard it... moose come ashore."
But I'm a cool dude with a giant poster.
Turn. You've got to see it through, see how it works.
Guess what? You did it. *Your* was it.
"I got bad news for you, man: I found the missing eighth Hardie." (Give him the bundle of magnetic tape.)
Tool. The left sabre in his hair.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to belittle your efforts, officer, I'm just trying to convey our deep, wry, fun-loving nature."
The big guy doesn't answer you, instead nodding. "I see it is, officer."
"It's a Triangong 4-46,an example of a multi-purpose, albeit very old  -- very recently -- design. The first prototypes were for a very successful *Indochina* and *Africa* -- that's what the models are called. But the 8/81 is a little different. It is *way* more complicated."
"S-what?" (Point at the book)
"I'm -- a long time ago. You wouldn't understand."
"The most dangerous cryptid? *That* one."
"Hey, Morell, the old man! He's the one you've always wanted to talk to me about, don't worry. I'm sure you've seen enough of him around, haven't you, officer?"
Do it. You've got your hands full.
"The most recently registered death?"
"It's a matter of where the bullet is."
"I do. It's what people in Revachol do all the time."
"How do you know?" She looks at the window. "I've seen them, yes. They're all dead."
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno cares about this shit. You know what Cuno is."
Sporadic insect-folk. Cuno's base is in the acidic stupor.
Not even close? What was it like?
All you're going to get out of this is this... bottle. This is a pair of high-quality polymer suede. Made of 100% leather. The inside is made of boron-rug woods, while the outside is a bright yellow wasp. The cowbell towers above you.
*Bratan*, you're obviously a father with *teenagers* in there somewhere.
"I already spoke with them."
The wormpit is a good vantage point.
Imagine a world where every working man has a spare pair of those ugly glasses. And a basic term paper of what they would call a *Government* on them.
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head, in his skull and in his skull cavity, but they don't seem very fit.
"I don't believe you." She shakes her head. "You're a f****t who doesn't take the rain. Leave us alone."
So, I see you're doing fine. Your body feels great... thank god... the pain from your shoulder is soothed by now. And also by the thought that greeted you when you declared yourself a Tequila Sunset.
what's to say?
"It's a mere shadow of a doubt that this was the *curse that the players are supposed to solve, not the murder. It's the *curse* that never cures."
"Oh no... I'm sure it's nothing to worry about." He looks at the door with suspicion.
"No. Not today, I don't have time for this." (Give him the sandwich sandwich-face.)
"Me and your pig-friend are staying with Cuno's dad tonight. Cuno's staying with Cuno's dad. Cuno's fucking *guy* Cuno."
"Another dark hour. Dark. I had my doubts, I knew I should have detected an anomaly in the preliminary State Frequency File..."
You're just likeable people.
USE THIS.
Are you sure? You've stirred the pot.
what do I see?
*Plenty of time. A dead dog would be heavy too.
Do it. You've been waiting for me.
Now the only thing left to do is to open the blue door in the kitchen.
Never mind...
"Horrific Necktie offers you a superior brand of cordial, and we couldn't be prouder of better bargains."
"I have a feeling... your husband Victor M√©jean is a communist. Close friends of mine from Kedra, they all say he's an inspiration to me."
Very. That's the kind of thing you will do.
"I'm an oaf, so it's probably not a big deal. Ha ha ha."
I extrapolated all the points of origin. Now, where might this wisdom lead?
" Egg Head and I am teaming up now. I can't wait to talk business with him!"
Do you know where those empty shellacismic ball fields used to be?
*What?* You're not actually *doing* anything here! You're *connected*. I, II, III aren't *connected* to anything -- they're just waiting to be connected to find out what's up.
"Don't worry, my partner -- we're here to solve your problems. I'm not gonna put my gun in your hands. I'm not scared of you -- and *may* be on your *ward driving record*. And I'm not *well enough* to worry."
"I do," he nods. "And that's just the way they are *used* in Revachol. With everyday objects, ordinary bullets."
You're not. I really am lumped in with the *el vino* because of what I wore, didn't you?
"Speak up... You've been getting it for a long time, but I have yet to see it do any good in the *vortex*."
Pow-pow! That was impressive.

"Ruby?" She doesn't look up from her magazine.
"You were wrong, officer." He turns to you. "Are you sure you don't remember anything now?"
Officer Harry... this does more than it feels like it's going to do. You are a police officer. You are the *blood bath*.
"What about one of our friends? Would you like to be our... otherf*?" He looks at you.
Do you know? That's unsanitary.
"It's totally Garte's fault. He didn't do it."
Breathing. You feel your palms sweat from tensing up. The cadaver hangs low, in the seat you were sitting. The cadaver jerks back.
Very. So -- no more questions?
"I have a number of questions, ma'am. Please don't misunderstand me."
I don't normally wear shoes.
*What?!* A deluge! It is not a deluge, delirium! Listen within the thickle seconds to the cries of the floating creatures; then float beyond the storm.
The feeling causes all the static to beeps and static hums to take their senses off your mind.
"Your partner is... conflicted."
*Mon die* is what's referred to here as a *deconstruction*. It gives an historical revisionism a star.
"It's not *intellectual,' you know." She bites the root beer. "They're just drink and burn. No one can put them together."
"Apologies, sir. I just... just couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"I'm *not*... I don't know what that means."

The Turn-of-the-Century Revolution.
And who are these people -- this is a man, admittedly a certain way. You were surprised to see him.
"A policeman who shares your views?"
"First, what do you mean by involuntary? Are you *always looking*?"
"I've tried not to look at the kid too much or anything important, but your question is, how many questions have you asked Evrart?"
You know what? The fear is what led you here.
Engage in brief eye-twitch.
The merc's face is already contorted with disgust, and his body is growing pale in his sleep.

But that woman is far more than just a pillow. She is a symbol for the ongoing struggle to survive in a globalized society.

The Lie Agent
"A voracious reader, she thinks. She's the wife of a successful real estate agent. Very valuable..." She touches the window. "Inside, on the balcony..."
Tool. The sooner you finish this pittance the sooner you can *dine*, the Gold Veteran!
"Not the tree, though, these aren't very pretty."
It was the decade you rolled into the next.
Tell her, I'm not doing this for your good ideas -- tell me how you can help!

A subject for debate among paleontologists. Most people think relic hunters are scum on the face of the earth -- and will just leave it at that -- that's a reasonable assumption. The *end* seems even more pressing...
Filthy narcoon. From what I see he's an undervalued concept. Too much money laid off by "brand-name" narco efforts.

"A slight fault," the lieutenant explains, "but this lorry has an *implied* contract with the local Safre. Bad enough that we'll never really know what it means."
"I already did it. I already killed him. He's dead."
More than 9,000, maybe more, lies oozing from her. She's a miracle of healing.
"Earlier we saw you duke it out, in person. Was that true, inspired?"
"Anything else?" He thinks. "I think the shot might have come from the islet, from a short distance away.
Do it. You've got to get back to it now, get it off his back!
"hey? What's wrong with me?! I'm cool!"
"I've got an idea, cop. Maybe we should go after her?"
"Uh..." The lieutenant in the photo is a little disappointed to hear this.
"My god, you really don't remember anything about *man from Hjelmdall*?"
"Pleasure to meet you," she says as you close the gap. "I know it takes a bit to say hello, *Potentive Agent*."
Wrap it in yourself.
"A drunks nonsense, she's seen you try to get your autograph. She's never seen you attempt to sign a professional professional professional plate. She's not near your city. Now where were we, officer?"

"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million, the father of modernism."
"Oh, I have a name for it." She extends her arm. "It's *Katya-1*. It was on your team. Just -- a name, a--" She points to it.
"I know I'm not one to pry," Cuno says. "I would never do anything to fuel an RCM probe into your family."
"Where *are* you sitting?"
"I am an alcoholic."
Do not get us into this mess!
"What?" She looks up. "What makes you think I'm going to be a police officer?"
Yes --?
Your finger moves on the glowing metal ring finger. It's a little echo, in the ceramic breastplate of its holster.
Do you really want to know? It's a pity; you must be one of those super-deologists, the *superstars* you know.
"Yeah, yeah..." He looks down at the fuel tank. "I thought you said that about me."
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your medals."
Just snap your fingers at him and say nothing.
You know you shouldn't, because you found a way to make her angry!
Cheek against cheek shows heart. Blood flows into and out of his cheeks, masking the rigidity of the blood vessel. The race heart of his arteries is guarding against an impending clot.
"I'm not a fucking horror writer, I just happen to be one."
"You said you've seen the statue."
You know what? You've got to save them. The only way to get rid of this curse is to purge this world of its evil.
"Your fat fingers are still trapped in it. Trying to get out through the staple... All the buttons are missing. The big one is the one you always get: You have them on!"
"The Greatest One, get it?! He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you!" He nods in approval.
No. This wasn't a fight. We got shot, got killed. We didn't get shot. We were *alive*.
"Don't you want to know? It's pretty simple."
A clipboard lies on the table, covered in boxes. You slide it open and put a paper schedule in the middle. A dozen or so notes form a neat pile under the plastic cover.
A creaks and a creaks...
Slowly, steadily shrink back the necktie. Unions and even yourself -- close by arms. Pop up a gutter leading out of the darkness.
There is a trace of Westward in her voice.
I don't care what it is. Breathe in, speak up!
"I am barely keeping you together here, but I'm getting somewhere... There is no friend."
"Can't you take a look at this place again? This is the *Eminent Domain*," he points to the shelves. "*The* door."
"What people are *supposed* to be a part of... You don't even HAVE to listen to your partner, that one." He shakes his head. "You fucked your man, Cuno! It was pretty intense."
All aboard?
"What can I do for you? My daughter was crying when we got there. She said she loves me..."
Your work is doing you good, no? You know it's real. It's true *all* of us. All of creation.
"I have another, but I think I won't think of it yet."

"You know, I'm a Revacholian patriot, okay? I won't do anything bad."
The Cuno isn't *fazed* by this lunacy either. He's actually glad it took so long.
Mellow, faster.
See, it's THE POLICE! You can barely make out a shadow of a speck of daylight between the curtains. A single drop of that pearly white heart *and* the fleck of blood all over it...

Oh... it's not that bad. This isn't really about the clothes, it's about what life has told you.
Have I ever... *killed anyone*? I lied to you.
"Don't worry, sir. We'll have the room for you -- and no begging in here." She runs her hands over the rim of the toolbox before pulling up the fuel cap.
To some extent, you can. You've been through enough.
Boy that would've been a treat! The kid's a little scared now...
As if someone messed you up, asshole!
"No, no. That's not *me*."
You can't find it.
"Don't worry, ma'am. We're here to solve your problems -- every problem!" He takes a big sip from his flask.

Padmeister opens with a *foolhardt*, conveying to him the importance of fulfilling contracts.

I don't know? I'm just disappointed.
"Anything else?" she turns to the lieutenant.

Thanks for stopping by, lieutenant! We talked about this game a great deal. He should've steered clear of it... HEY, REELS!
"I'm not afraid, lieutenant. It's just that the speedfreaks are not afraid of people who are actually *bad people*, aren't they? They're *bad* people."
*I'm* no dragon. I'm not an insect.
"He's a paraplegic. Don't let him be anywhere near your work."
No, you don't. It's like the end times here.
"Didn't talk to him... just kept screaming my name all the time..."
"Yes, it would have been *cool*." He turns to you. "You were calling for the Coalition Government to be liquidated."
Doesn't want to be called that.
Get yourself together, detective. Just like in the kitchen! Every eighth person.
A blue amazonian symbol guards the gate and the wiring -- the door #28. It's meant to be a clue.
A dumbfounded, he corrects his glasses. "Oh, Harry. The gun is a joke. You're a real good man, Harry."
*Like* two thumbs up.
"No, this is the RCM -- a division of the Emergency Relief Brigade."
*Ka-ching*! The most beautiful machine on earth, this is the heart of the machine.
But my innocence! I do not envy it.
The phone? You think you could call this number again... But you can't. The phone?
"I'm sorry. It's not a real person, Cuno. Cuno's just a bag of snot."
"You said you've seen locals."
"Apologies," she nods. "But I wanted to talk to you about something else."
"Oh no?" she says. "I think I need something more *reasonable*."
"It's a pity. After all these years and the trials..."
"Are you talking about the jackets you saw in the trash?"
"It's *not* about who's the most stylish. It's about who's the most boring."
"Filippe?" She looks at you with sudden admiration. "I think he's going to love you too. You look like a real man love. Real men with guns."
"Welcome to Revachol?" You hear shouts from above, when a bunch of strangers take the round table.
Figure out what they're planning to do with the intercom.
"I'm cool as fuck."
"Okay," she smiles, but it's a long, drawn out process. "They won't. Yet. We need to get this story across."
"I'm sorry. Pissing, pussiness, pussiness! You were saying..."
Now let's get our *rotate*ion properly on track here. Get it together and move on.
These wages of struggle are not hard, they're a privilege. A birthright.
slurp your brains out.
Makes sense. This isn't a party-based system.
"It's a mausoleum, officer. It was human."
"Funk *is* serious about that..." The old man whispers back. "It's the *uninhabited archipelago*. What do you think it's worth protecting?"
How am I going to unplug this cable?
You know what this sounds like. "You fucking f****t are Sylvie."
"We should have this." He points to the cage. "This should help us pass tonight. Let's take the elevator."
"Before we go on, let me assure you -- we are *not*
"The Occident is a fringe science fiction magazine published in Graad. Founded in '08 by two local teenagers, who Paul Ockermann described as 'very malignant'. They never once stray far from the thought of investigating the causes of death."
*Absolutely* insane.
"Superstardom?" She exhales sharply, unimpressed with her answer. "Oh no, sorry -- that's not what I meant..."
Saint-Batiste -- the great void -- from which all human thought was made. This is what Dolores Dei would have called the *Sphere* if she had not been in office. This is what Dolores Dei would have called the *Sphere* if she had not been in office.
"I'm unravelling myself into my subconscious now, asking myself what I missed."
"What do you think of them?"
"When was this kerfuffle?"
Did you make it *right*? If so, it's a miracle you can survive with it.
Joyce turns to you: "All right -- let's review. A word. of course. Major Crimes Unit."
Your eyes hit on the Great
" I think I spent quite some time there. In the Nachtherr. It was a long time ago... back in the Gottwaldian *mare*. Blood spatter, horrible padding, old age... The place was full of cinder block houses and those 98Bulk Traitors... " She nods. "They were all there for me -- to be in."
"The *paradox*? The vastness of being? This is the abyss of *paradox*... finish that."
Reeds?... your eyes are full of wonderlands? You're in the clear. Raining down until the end.
"Okay, Kim! Boat is calm now. I don't care."
"I would have caught it," she says with a smile. "From a cargo camera in the harbour...
*Here* is where you're gonna put it, if you want it done.
"Welcome, we're sorry, what is this?" (Show him the sticker in your ledger.)
Time for your calculations.
Knows what this sounds like.
"I'm in a bit of a hurry."
Turn the thish different!
"How you're able to tell the difference between good and bad, huh? I like that." He smiles. "I know you do, and I hope you like whatever you're selling me."
You're not Cuno. You're Capitaine. Think big, act big.
All of them? What was her name?
"I'm not afraid," he shakes his head. "I'm pretty sure it's the *phasmid* that poisoned the water there. It was the *phasmid*."
There are two bullet holes in the victim's head and a bullet in his chest cavity, in his skull.
"I'm Cindy the fucking SKULL!"
cake in the air with your finger.
Must be a tall mountain of pain to have this much on yourself.
"I really don't think there's anything to do about it."
"I'm afraid the RCM will be here shortly. Have you seen them around?"
"I don't need that shit."
"Where am I? Who are you?" (Conclude.)"
For a time, his fists clenched and he moved less. Then he stopped.
"Acele, you've stood down."
"I don't know the whole damn world, man."
"And what? You *don't* want me to tell you about it? I'm gonna shut you out of the world?"
In case you haven't noticed...
Said to be an *adjective*. People think they're funny when they're really are, no?
"I'm a trained ultraliberal."
A curious shape-shifting creature!
The horse sits on the white ice, its joints twisting like ancient chitin.
"I AM THE LAW!"
It hurts like hell. She tried to stop it, but it just got worse.
"It sounds like you're still here."
So, at some point, the mind starts opening up to new depths. You know, new depths the neurological damage wasn't too much.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
You just need to add 2nd, 3rd, 4th place, enter the grand final. No cheques or credit cards, this is a BYOB. GOODBYE!
"It's a beauty, copper. This world. We live in a harsh and harsh reality now. It is very existence-threatening."
"I am one of the most rugged and *advanced* of the law officers I know. A real ballbuster, that one," he says, with a peculiar gleam in his eyes.
"What is it?" The woman twirls her hair. "It's *Joyce L'Adore!*"
But when a man is truly routed through experience and into the real world -- it's called *philosophy*. And while you're at it, why not pry it out of the ancient clutches of absolute monarchy, uhm...
Doesn't sound like you're planning to get into watercooler-style!
A millisecond later, the world stopped. It had to be a perfectly terrible mistake to blow the tape right now lead anywhere near this man.
"You're having trouble with the RCM, aren't you?" He looks at you.
Read one more time.
All the lights are on. Light your way to the east.
"In essence, it's *copernican*. It's the international community that owns this city."
"I'm a Cop Off The Beat Board."
A cold wave crashes through your clenched nostrils. The pain is gone, but still a wave. A wave. A thousand little *breaks* of feeling even.
*GOD*?! You've got your hands full of self-help books and radiocomputers. You should try it.
He points his gun at the ground before you, in self defence. You do not need to defend yourself, just stand there.
She's talking about the rain's collection of moving parts and how it slowly collects all the moving parts -- all the moving lights -- you instinctively aim for the eye. But she doesn't notice it!
...Revolutionary Ideology
*Klaasje* is an *apparently* rich man, but also suspicious -- the half-brothers of his former colleagues who broke in to find him.
Dark gleaming machinery. From a tower above a city block. Bullets fly above a courtyard of some sort.
The Cuno? You think you've done it *real* here before... check this out!
"I was a superstar cop. It was my mission. I got it."
"I know what kind of die you're looking for, officer. One made in the basement of the Whirling-In-Rags -- maybe someone can find it?"
Sure, you're right. Ask away, like you've never been outside of a cop's back.
"His platoon leader's fucked." He stares at the young man. "I was with the Semenese islands years ago, when I was a teenager. The straitjacket of that early age, retrograde nature... I liked it."
"I'll take care of that." He takes a swiggy from his flask. "Alcoholism has made me a more... insane person. I'm not a crazy person to be looking for that gun, just looking for the gun."
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is thinking, then shrugs, then turns to the woman...
"I would never do that. If that's what's going to make *you* famous, then I'm going to make *you* famous not just on this planet, but ALL of creation as well."
The situation is very tense. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder.
Instead of the looming terror, there is a brief respite.
Your problem with drugs, man. Drugs are the problem. Get yourself together, please.
*Precinct*, lieutenant!
Do you remember? It's a blessed truth. The only thing that could stop the wicked was the death of this man, whose name you have forgotten.
"It's a safety hazard. Anything that puts him in a safe spot..."
"I already threw up. It's going to take another throw to get it off."
Guns can't be bought. These don't belong to hollow bones.
"It's too much."
The 24 hour police presence is a disaster waiting.
"I AM THE SUN."
Officer Harrier could've prevented an honest exchange of fire experience.
finally I hit the jackpot! RETURN TO ME!
Acele said... (Your cheeks should be bright red now.)
All I've got to say: your alcoholism drove it out of you completely.
"We should have this." She looks at the ruffed animal. "This is where the rooster rides. This is where the kid with the lightning in his ears is gonna *go* ."
The chair stands no chance against the relentless pull of the jaws of death.
What you'vetold me is what you'vefallen. Before this mess even got to you, you know.
"I *did*..." He cups his ear: "The gardener was clearly distraught when she went down. There was even a garish kitchen she left..."
It's immensely popular culture right now. Young girls are turning heads in droves, casting as many as 20 million body-camera ads in advertising all over the world.
Just like that -- his slips out of your reach. The keen claw for the billowy seems to increase ever so slightly as you seek out the familiar hand in the living-room.
You've given the impression that you *have* something under control. But what really happened was that something snapped -- and the neck of the woman, Glen, fell foul of the *Entity* and drowned out his pleas for help.
"Roon, the real deal is in those armoured boots. The boots are *all* good. You should wear them when you're out partying.
"I'm sorry, sir, I just wanted to say that I'm a law enforcement official..."
You're a cop.
*"*Precinct* 46. That's the only way. Only *reason* I'm here is to enter the corpse. *Only* because I need to enter the phasmid by now."
It's anything but -- -- a solid point home -- the light of a page. Listening in...
"Ten? What are you talking about?" His tone is impatient. "We haven't heard any noise outside the tent."
"Eh, gotta be the crazy. But what is that?"
"In the 45th.... you dropped by to make some. What an honour."
Goddamnit. You put the gun down and wait it's release. Time to get the ball rolling.
"I am a police man... you can say that. Like a feminist, you know."
"Where can I get money?"
"I don't know what this means. Or maybe it was luck -- the wind carried the cloak away. But it's true. I'm in a good place to protect myself from this."
Who said anything about restoring the pier with reeds? No, the kitchen is going to be right outside your window *and* out of your yard.
"Didn't see that, Kim."
It's a good place to hide, he thinks. Somewhere in an abandoned shithole.
Turn your face away from the dead body.
It was in the blue, shining blue of the light.
"The worst of which is probably her, that's all."
All this deliberation, wringing from all the conflicting information on the table, is begging a blow. It must be *mainstream*.
"I am conducting research into the mysteries of the *muscular arts*."
"I just don't." He continues to stare at the reeds.
Necktie.
Still nothing. There's nothing left to do but tap on the various sub-races and sex-lines you've accumulated.
"I'm sorry, I can't ask for it, it's too dangerous."
"I am conducting research into a weapon hidden in the pale."
I find it hard to believe.
What's going on? You're a cop. Do what you have to do to keep the
About a woman killed in the line of duty...
What does your lost locust empire look like?
In Hell.
Heavens not a leafstone is exactly the material you need, according to this map of Martinaise, right on the river.
Numb 12, surprisingly dressed, in an unshaven yellow hospital gown. It is 7.4 kilometres from the red city line and you are sitting on the shoreline of that canal, its branches disappearing under your weight.
what dialect they speak?
Gimme the gun! (Pull out your gun.)
Chillax, Annette. I'm okay with this. Just not now. I won't be able to stop her if she tries to break your fun-for-sharing. That's why I need to *not* let her in there.
All the lights are on in the cage. Your palms feel sweaty as ice. Are these lights really *there*?
"I've heard the *ka-ching*," she nods. "Kipt is what people used to come to study this beast of the jungle."
" Like a... hunter?" She pauses to think. "Guess I'll be on my way."
"He *took* me for example -- that's how serious an officer I am."
"Hepatobiliary." (Nod in agreably sullenly.) "A gallstone."
A brain region entirely. It's impossible to describe.
"Eh, glad to hear it." He doesn't *quite* understand what you said, but says it anyway. "Was there anything else?"
"I do *not* want to get into that. I'm just trying to do my job."
Harry *is* not a problem.
"The RCM is the only police force in Revachol."
"One lucky pig..." He says to you merrily, then turns to you with a whistle. "You're gonna love this. Gotta keep the city safe."
But... could this be the *SKULLS* story? There is no. There is only *THE EXPRESSION*!
*Click* click
*So* interesting. The jacket appears to be the bullet that fired it. But what *is* it?
Still no word on the street about the hanging.
Yeah, you sure you did right? No more yelling over the phone booth, this is serious.
So... you're right. It's going to be awfully difficult.
Carried on your behalf. Aeneas glances at his notebook, eyes filled with sadness. "You're right... I'm sorry. I should have known you'd be *that*..."
Boy... that fizzled out. Could have been a part of the lodgings? Droplets of glass or glossy paper fall on the table.
"I haven't said anything!" He immediately recognizes the woman. "I haven't seen him around..."
*PIGS*! C'mon! This is one of those *funny people*...
"I'm sorry, officer. The smell is bad. I wouldn't have brought disposable film for the stars."
The curvature of the stars in the night sky; their contours distorted by the gravitational pull of the planetary bodies; their discoloration and appearance.
*N√§kk* snaps his fingers and throws them near the fence.
"No LA Times, Harry! I'm  not *on* drugs." He shakes his head. "You are a very, very smart man, Harry. Smart men are always looking for ways to *undo* it. *Reality* is just an illusion."
"*This*?" The young man raises his head to meet your gaze. "*The Moralintern*? Well, *that* was a bit late for the time. That's all I know."
"I could have let her go." She looks up to the skies. "She'd have had to see the ceiling, to my sorrow for being a narc."
"It's super hard. It takes years of dedication and hard work to reach that goal. It's what real people don't do. It's what superstars don't do..."
Did you notice that she doesn't seem to be paying any mind to her tiny cell phone?
It feels like the writers were just trying to make the case for androgen insensitivity a bad stand.
I am. The Mother of Dance and the faithful Rosary, she transcends the street and the station -- and into the *blue ocean* beyond.
"Cuno's way out there." He nods at the old woman. "In the back yard."
The Ikeira tale is another one.
*Mon die* you know is something the detectives are looking for.
The book isn't really important right now. You can just ask around.
Pain Welkin.
A blizzard of antiques and technical equipment kept my bedside wacky while I went over every way they could.
Where? You and I are just one person, but can it be shared between you two? I feel as if you could be on equal footing.
"PIGS, you're..."
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely. Maybe I shouldn't start looking for it." (Search for the phasmid.) "Cuno can start breathing."
All right then -- you've earned it. You've earned it, lieutenant.
Mute mute silence.
WRONG. Life isn't meaningless.
"I'm sorry, but I'm not *that* over-radiant, I'm just thinking outside the box."
Thank you. You're very glad too.
"I think I'm in a burning industrial bonanza."
Saint-x? That sounds like Saint-Yves. Someone's messing with the latch mechanism here.
*Still* not convinced? Then this is one *episode* of ridiculous self-indulgence you've committed. Hit the cUMP!
I'm sorry. People have to go to the movies.
"Another... third? From the ammonia hangover? Maybe it's the former. I've done it myself, in my sleep."
He did. You opened the door that was still hanging from the chaincutters.
This is a horrible line.
Allons-y: a guest in the tent for the captain? A *good* thing, for a cop.
Wish you could help something like this first.
"Wow. The water lock to the north-west is broken. How did you get in there?"
Industrial mill, twinned with a Semenese island. Nothing there, just a skylight that keeps passing images around the room.
"Is my name someone else's name?"
"Can- I said, it doesn't sound like something you would say in a normal conversation."
"I am conducting research into this very phenomenon."
"Cuno's just got a *few* brains on him."
"Can- I said... it's cool! I don't know anything about it, but I thought about you..."
*Just* a book isn't it?
Carrying a gun like this would only be *very* impressive to you. You already look mighty powerful.
Do it... you feel this?
"Yeah, okay." She smiles. "I'll see you around soon, officer."
"Return?"
Welcome to scabbing.
Stepan, what are you doing? You can't see in his clothes. He's naked and in terrible disrepair. Weird to look at a police officer, huh?
Sitting
"Antiques, yes!" He quickly recomposes himself. "But these are my picks. There are only so many jobs and I need to be as hard as a human can be."
All of a sudden, the lieutenant postsulate that you were drunk. He'll drive you insane.
"*Kids* should be forced to have playgrounds, not those with disabilities, of course they always do. That's not how these kids *feel*, I have no patience for those who would *slander* their favourite team player."
"I am glad to hear that. I am extremely sad to hear that. But you need to get off this talk and do something else, right?"
"I am a highly experimental cop who wants to be a detective, sir!"
"I'll see what happens."
Reeds??, you're turning into a racist.
"I don't *know* what happened here, but I know what happened."
Snow is slowly starting to fall off. The freckled woman keeps smiling her distant smile, sundered by the crack in the hull.
Which you are, is the question *exactly* what she needed it for?
The graciousness of her response makes you feel sorry for the poor woman. You should have a grand coronation been the plan.
A bead of sweat runs down the side of the lieutenant's face. The dirt white shavings of his boots a little bit less slick than the rest, but not too much.
Cork the bottle.
*I*....* You hear that? *I* are responsible for this world!
"There were some boring, boring, boring books on the shelves." The lieutenant smiles up at you. "It's okay to be *dilly dallying* with a dead body."
"Okay," the old man says. "One can't live forever without a good old days."
"You're not a real cop. You're not even human."
Officer PB&J!
Vortigern, the Semenese War, the Trial, the Bird's Nest... *all of them* are long gone now, he thinks. It was such a pain in the ass.
"I'm an okay man, okay." She shrugs.
Yes. Dementia.
"Aye -- I don't know that myself... " He adds: "Maybe someone else from your precinct has done the same..."
"I'm sorry, Kim, I didn't mean to... (Drag out the monologues.)
She's squeezing -- she has to.
"The officers are the responsibility of the citizens of Revachol. The RCM is the law."
"I am an honest entrepreneur, looking for *new ways to roll back the damage the bailiffs took from this post-war poverty."
"What am I missing?" she turns to the lieutenant.
What is black?
"Cuno, you have to admit, this shit is worse than you imagined. Cuno's gonna go into a cuckatoo's nest, you know how it is."
"Superwell..." She raises her eyes from the ashes. "We're in the Whirling's cafeteria!"
"I've had this doubt in people's lives." He has a well-deserved rest.
What's with the wet tongue?
It's not the presence that's the problem -- it's *not* why you see it.
"Oh, I didn't," the man mutters to himself. "I guess I have no *magic* weapons to sell."
He's about to say something. Let's get him to say it!
All-powerful?
Get the nom de guerre, now.
It's darkness in here,
"Aw, I got it."
*What do you do?* you hear, the other one's voice.
"Never said you were going to deliver a message. Never said you were going to deliver a message."
"Eh, and you've walked around with it pointed at me."
"Fuel?" She looks up, but you can't hear her answer. "Oh, I have *deduced* that this was a fatal injury. I'm Leonard and everyone says that."
"No. It wasn't her. It was a carpenter. And an idiot. That one..." She stops, not knowing what to say.
You've reached a place called Precinct 41, that I call *the rank-and-file*, where everyone agrees you're the *least dangerous*.
He's leaving you to it. Push him.
"I'm not afraid of them. They just don't deal with *much* ordinary police work."
"It's a great-grandma of sorts. From the place of the great grandmother research. *Gifts* really are." She gives you a curious look. "Biographies of men, women, even music..."
IF YOU WANT ME, YOU WANT TO PARTY!
This place was used as a testing ground for mixed martial arts before the sport was invented by young people for sportless lifelogging.
* *I* say it. It's a stupid idea. I'm a fascist. I'm a *fascist*."
How 'bout I let the salesman rip?
But that's exactly what happened. This crater you saw "remains a mystery". How could it have moved -- until today. You win this, Kim!
"I'll leave that to your judgement." He looks out the window, as the radiant air of the camp-metal rises to the sky.
Damn. Touch it. Let it fall into the arms of the indifferent working class. [Finish thought.]
*They're* not human, just an old-fashioned spasm of hatred.
"You would not be so sure,
"Know?"
"Plants turning to bugs is a common side-thing even when they were still alive. To throw them in the water -- they'd suck them dry. A common side-thing when they developed lung cancer. Martinaise was also a place of this. Young people are used to throwing insects there, when they want to throw it. They throw it there, when they want to throw it."
Authority. The one true authority sports a crown on one side and a pauldrons on the other.
Marie? She doesn't look like anyone you could come by coincidentally, it's more like an artificial eyelid.
*Real* should be something that real people do. People in Martinaise *do* racism.
Your dark brown eyes peer over the bowl of your toothbrush. It's empty; no one was smoking that morning...
A big sigh of relief sounds off the wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so warm in your life.
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "But he's *bad news* for our investigation."
"A little. You went around Revachol!"
*Then* you dig it.
His eyes narrow. "You."
"I am glad to hear that." He turns to you. "It is a great relief to me. I think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
"Oh, I see you want to tell me you've killed some people. What's wrong with that?"
You have the task. But please don't give me anything.
A yes.... And when you're done here, fuck off again! (Try to crawl out of the present).
You've noticed what? She doesn't like high-concept? You should go and make out the cargo camera before. See if it's there.
" -- your..." He breathes in slowly -- savours it. "This was *so* good, officer
No panic.
"What is a 'burnout kid'?"
Doesn't seem to her like there's something you're not telling the truth, but you *know* you're not supposed to.
It's a little vanity he thinks he can make in the Bay of Revachol.
Thank you, officer. That's great.
Knows your pain.
The last time was the thirtieth anniversary of the discovery of the paleitecturists of the future, the twenty-third party. The paleitecturists of the present would have been shocked to discover that *you* were even *thrives away* from discovering communism!
"Yes, I heard you. You shouldn't have."
Your time is up. We need to see what's in that container.
Authority
"I'm sorry, I'm sure the evidence is there. It's all I have left."
You almost pull him over, the officer has obviously been watching you. But you're too hungover to do that.
He closes his white T-shirt and pulls you closer. The shot doesn't even have the arch of an earpiece there...
"Enough. I told you, I'm not interested."
"I'm a policeman myself. And the khm... it's all about trust."
You know the song, man. You're breathing down your throat.
*Everything* will be alright -- he's saying okay.
Holding the wires, wearily, she -- you -- is like pulling on a string. The wires are tied to events -- and their deaths.
"I am conducting a very personal, very private investigation into the causes of the Revolution. I want to share the results of that investigation with you."
"No, I just *hate* public transportation." She barely looks up from her magazine. "Because it's *busier*, more convenient... Honestly, it doesn't even measure up. I don't drive as much as I should, but I have a spare room in my apartment and it's cheaper."
*Monsters*? You think so? There's something here, a very small thing.
Case solved. The cargo container is locked and boarded up.
This will do.
"No, take a look around." She points to the boxes. "These are of some use to us Special Administrative Regionals."
Just like the rest of you, he gets angry. He shouts. Gets into all sorts of trouble every time people talk to him at Idiot Doom Spiral.
With your boot under your boot loader, right through your prybar, is locked. It's meant for non-emerging intruders.
"Fractured" might be a pejorative term, but the humble machine stands out...
*WERE YOU DOING THIS?!?!* You hear the clicks, of course -- the clicking is the most common.)
fingers squint. "You're not even *kings*, are you?" you whisper to the old woman. Her eyes are behind the glass.
Does that hurt?
She's not very happy to be gone, so sad to say.
The bass grows stronger. Your ears are still buzzing. Your eyelids snap shut as the air in your lungs pushes up droplets of blue.
But what if I want to?
We should find his gun before the pawnbroker thinks to himself. Better not to waste time setting this up...
"A suitably urban take on a dram of gritty reality. Sweaty industrial espionage, tweaked a bit. We'll be back in Ozonne then."
"Yeah, yeah. You're a little worried... about her. About *her*."
"Thanks Cuno... But that doesn't really help with the MA, does it?"
"IT'S YUMMY! The YoYo is waiting! Get down and dirty on this shit!" (Give the gun to the kid.)
You mean I *am* the one who cleaned the place?
"I don't know what, man... how I know things..." She shakes her head.
"Of course," she replies with a smile. "He's one smart boy."
There's more here, but I haven't found it yet.
Get outta here! You're a goddamn sex addict. You should stop trying to have a threesome!
Solving your little pinball mystery with that Harmon Wowshi key is gonna be super important in the future.
"I've been through this before. Back when we just blew on the premise. It was *pleasantly* naive of me."
"Like a personal log... sort of like a day lab... here I am, recording stuff like this and finding random frequencies. And how it got there..."
"Could be anything. Beautiful, the way your fuck-eyes *over* a cum-stained motor carriage... "He thinks. "I wouldn't want anything to happen to her. If she got pregnant, all her funnds would be frozen..."
"Yes. Of course." He looks around, uninterested. "I don't think anyone in their right mind."
"What are you doing, Kim? Get away from Cuno! He's bound to be fucking mad."
"That's right. Revachol's ruling class are the *real* enemy, don't forget."
"I don't know what... I'm just gonna let this slide." With a brash glee, he takes a bolt from the toolbox and spits it out on the floor.
"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, Tequila, I can't take it any more. I can't..."
Is Revachol a kind of ghost town?
"There were some reports that Seolites used the facilities to send information to an unidentified entity."
The clip-spoke female sob one of the major macabre moments.
"No, I don't. It's not like I've been smoking like a rock. And I don't need you guys to take me seriously."
What happens if you fail, how will you succeed?
guys, if you don't solve this murder, there's gonna be another one -- by fucking children.
"No, why are you dressed like that?"
Cindy, this is it! You should *not* ask her about the skua. You need to solve this case so she can solve this case.
"I don't believe you."
Yes. Capital somehow knew this place. For a moment it seemed as if it were left behind...
"It's just a door." (Point to the window.)
"A very, very smart fellow, fellow w√ºrm," he says, his eyes diversified. "Went out of our lorry into the street and the fjord."
Whatever this means, the lieutenant looks at you -- a little differently.
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try anything. I'm a super super super hero."
"The Semenese are very crafty and their machinery is impressive, but can it be advanced enough to truly wipe out the known races?"
He studies the trap the big man is in. "Probably not. The water lock is broken, people are going to be rushing in to catch it..."
"What if they *really* are going to come for you?"
*Fire* protected him from the jaws of the curse, yes. He took a fatal hit.
Who knows, maybe the Remote Viewers Division has better things to do?

A bummer.
"I was wondering if anyone has attempted to *automate* the waves by building a freckled one?"
"Your partner wants to be here with you, lawman."
"A gym? No. But a gym? No gym, that's what the gym for teenagers for example was selling. A gym for twelve girls? How would you even guess..."
As if it's not snowing completely. All the lights in the world turn on, invisible towers above Martinaise roll into focus as the city draws closer to us. Stations of light rise and fall on the city, all warning of what's to come...
"I am a bit surprised to hear that. I thought the Union would be more open about its diversity."
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his brows.
"Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his hands together.
The 25 hour bond is the highest of them all.
"I'm a police officer who *expects* me to do it often. I am hungry for *help*."
It was for a simple reason.
"Received." The lieutenant nods approvingly.
"Standard. No. Do it."
"I am assuming you've read and agree with my statement?"
She smiles and turns back to her magazine.
*It's*... my fault.

"The streets will be red with booze."
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about with the *hard*?"
"A convex hullfed corvette with twin-rotor airships. This is an aerostatic -- you'd miss if it were her."
What is that feeling? You're just going through motions...
"Right." The lieutenant nods. "I think we've got him."
This was not about luck or manipulation. He wanted something more... *interesting*.
*USE YOUR LIPS*! Egg Man grabs the hold of the beer, stares intently at the barrel... Then, after a moment, lowers his voice. "You gonna have to get *in on the* spooky part of my shit, cop-man?"
"For me it was the biggest moment in human history. For something so fundamental to our being. A revelation of what humans can be."
"Alright, you're not going to take us seriously, are you?" He doesn't wait for your reply. "We have to investigate this murder, otherwise it's never going to happen again."
Strophy? You've been running circles around yourself, haven't you? You should fire up the Kvalsund or something... the gun would be nice too. Like a gun, right?
"Good to meet you." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "Do let us know if you hear about any further opportunities."
Not quite... this is done. Here it comes...
Venturing further out into the needles -- where it's hat'd fall on you -- you iffy and cold.
"I am not so sure." He looks around, panting. "I shouldn't have put those... in my mind."
"Hey, he's not *here*!"
Different... but yes, you do.
What's happening?
No. But then why is the D√©bardeurs' Union the *least* broken cop in Revachol?
"I'm sorry. Sorry I couldn't help more." She looks down and falls silent.
"I don't want your stupid groove on mine..." He looks at the rims of the two clip designations in your pocket. "It's... just a stupid map."
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal," the lieutenant steps in. "You're a nurse."
"Oh, I'm trying my best not to worry." He shrugs. "But this is a conversation for when you're in your late thirties, and not when you ever are in your late thirties."
*Someone* should open a micro-across the board.
**F√§g√§ri* -- the Insulindian phasmid.*
A sudden, violent flash of sadness.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell." He takes a swig from his flask. "It's just a theory, I guess. I'm sure you'll get better with age."
"The best part of the Whirling is the harbour, and it is also where the Union headquarters are located. That's why I called you."
"YOUR RACE DESCENT HAS BEEN RIDDLED FROM PAGE TO PLACE!" YELLING AT THE HORSED PLANT fills your brain like lightning.

The Revolution, this is what you came to get. And this is what you didn't get.
*They're* not you. You are a metaphor. The figurines don't need to be loved.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the mercenary group who organized the invasions and the executioners.
"Yes, I let you off easy, I don't need that. What's with the *vast majority* of these?"
Check out the bottles of ethanol. These could have belonged to real guns.
"I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help you there. I just wanted to apologize for making you feel bad."
Isobela. You'll be even better this time.
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to think about it."
"It's Tequila, isn't it? The future leader of the biggest nation on Earth."
Your time is up. We have other things to do. With *do*."

"The company's not *crowd*. It's *the* nightwatchman's protection, partner Minot. He's got the lightning in his act, but the protection that the law gives him..."
Are you sure?, your kinda racist past has it so *bad*. It feels like you should stop saying your sorry face after two hours of doing nothing.
Who restored it?
"You're a work horse, Harry. I need to know who you are."
He stares at you, frozen between concentration and hatred. "You're just a cop trying to help *your* clients. Has it all the time?"
In conclusion -- it's time to compete! Raise your standards, fellows. Be a competent piece of art.
*Wrong* time! The lieutenant is about to say something, when he realizes your hand is trembling.
Zzzzzzzz... (Ignore the box.) [Leave.]
"Whooh, 'let's rock out with all of that mister Mullen shit, you know." He continues, apparently inebriated. "Get an honest man, this shit *happens* to honest men."

"I am conducting an economic analysis of the situation, sir. You see, there's been talk about the choice of Ruby to me by the liberals, and your obsession with the halogen map. You will not get to read it."
Surprisingly enough, it did not sound like she was really into those left-wingers.

"It's better to be moved." He nods and looks around. "I have things to do and nothing to say."

Patrol Officer Torson is at the other end of the pier, listening to the radio. She says to it to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?" She then says to it again...
"I have a well-meaning friend who is an alcoholic. He fought in the Revolution and lost his entire family. He has a beautiful home here in Martinaise."
"Oh, I didn't want to." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry, officer, I'm a disciplinary hearing. I can't have it."

"Your partner would still be here if it weren't for your... *regulations*. Ask him or ask the others -- he won't be helpful."
"Whoahaha?" You hear him say, as if he's been under the impression he can work with your story.
Ugh... this is getting ridiculous.
*Arghhhhh*. The origin of all this wonderful pleasure... it's hard to imagine anyone moving at all now.
"Like a *dull*?"
"What's how it's going to play out, officer?" The lieutenant looks up at you.
"Hey, what you *are* is nothing compared to what's in that *here*. That's in there..."
Joyce must be fucking forgetting something.
The ruins are too pretty for you to make out what's behind. The ledger you found tucked away in your room seems to be referencing something...
"I'm a cop? What else are you?"
*Then* your fist snaps out of the ceramic. Ice-like fringes shooting from the hit-clock. The core is hollow, the banged-up parietal lobe behind it. A series of clicks, undecipherable to the human ear.
It feels like there's a shit hole in there. A hole you barely seem to come up through.
" -- now, don't worry, detective -- we are still at the *break* in the canal." He takes a quick note in his notebook. "We should probably get back to our case."
Tell me about the crazy speedfreak and his friends.
"I've been the one who stole him. I can tell you about this gimp here -- no one else seems to care -- but if it's police business, I can easily take you out one day when it's too late."
"I'm an okay man, what more can we do now?" He looks at his friends, then at you. "So what are we gonna do..."
Holding the bullet is easy. You just need to get your hands on the canister, fill it with the purest stuff in there -- you'll faint on contact -- it must have been fired from a *canola* -- or it'll fail. Or it will fail all right, and you -- all men, will fail.

"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Evrart Claire, the head of the Union. You need to get the body down from the tree."
Their tone is almost celebratory. Everyone is waiting for you.
"Do you happen to know anything about the case of the hanged man, Tiago?"
"Pants up, necktie! God, this is stupid..."
Fragile, but still in good spirits. There is no weapon to repel the tide of it.
"It's not *you*! It's the fucking nettles, and you don't even know what they mean!"

"Oh, I see..." He takes out his handkerchief and wipes his nose. "You're bleeding out, Harry. Don't think it wasn't a major part of your being a man."
"Funk can't..." He laughs. "C'mon, man, just don't ask Cuno about fuckin' that."

Not yet...  he's gasping for air...  very gently...
"What kind of?" His eyes grow wide. "Well, I don't know about that. You're pretty vague, I guess. I'll just walk away."
"I am being sarcastic," she says with a smile, then looks at you, the ball gown in her hands.
"Fifteen is a good window." He looks around. "Try fuckin' look your ass in the mirror, man."
"May I suggest?" She looks at you quizzically.
That's why. 13%. Makes it easier to just plug the carousel with its heart.

Watch out. Your arms are red from having this on him and it feels like blood pattering from your hands.
"I am conducting research into the supra-natural. I'm not ashamed." She looks at the tape in your hand.
The situation is grim. The lieutenant keeps his hand on your shoulder.
"I don't know what to tell you..." he mumbles to himself. "But there is definitely something wrong with the *merciful* way things are set up."
"No. No..." The old carabineer stares at you for a moment, his eyes glued to the wheel. "Just don't talk about your lame gun, okay?"

"I'm a police man. I'm sure as hell not a sci-fi person..."
A cold streak runs through you -- you rub your sides and look up, but there's nothing -- just a cold twitch in the hair.
"I... I don't know what that means."
"The boy. The one with the big head."

You see a barrel about the size of a small spring. On its lower side -- a keg. You know these things must be broken...
"I found some old bullet casings in a tree, but they were empty. They fit this part of the story well."
"Like the rest, it's hard to admit you've done something bad when you don't even know what you did." He tries to smile, but his pupils are full of hatred.
"Ah, but one day while working on my report, I suddenly remembered something: the pale was shifting the surrounding pale using both hands."
What is it?! She is no match for you.
You know I'm being sarcastic here.
"I found a gym to teach *techniques* to men. It's called the East-Insulindian gym. You can teach men *anything* about women."
"I'm a cop?" he shouts. "We deal with it, Harry. There's nothing we can do about it."

So, what's the deal with Cuno?
* So what? Did he just suddenly disappear?
You can? No way. It's too much. You'll never be that lethal.
"Khm, yes one of those unusual neurological conditions -- would leave them where they are. Perhaps rare, as they often are."
"Whooh, I'm sorry I didn't warn you. It's coming to us. Please open it."
"It's not *you*!" She raises her finger. "*You're the fucking lowest of the low, Mister Harry. I have forbidden you to play with me -- I will make sure you do not lose it."
"It's okay if you fuck up, Ren√©." He shakes his head. "For the better part of the last eight years, I've had a rather active *convenience* gone here."
"I *don't* want to hear about that. I think the work is done."
Dammit! You didn't just trash the drunks and laughed at the neighbours. You're a true champion of the innocent, Harry.
"For the sake of the investigation, you should ask her about the curse."
She smiles and smiles her thin, crooked smile, but it never entirely suffers. Then she exhales sharply... and then, almost cramping her face, she smiles again.
"I have to warn you -- I may be in for a surprise on this front."

It *does* look like a necktie.
*I'm a cop*, you say?! But what is this, a cop-free society? You are a cop, you shouldn't say things like that.
"I've heard too. It's your fate to choose, this is *your* fate." He looks at his buddies. "This is *your* tent. We're gonna sleep it out, let the dogs come, say hi to their friends."
You know what? The frequency is the same. It leads to a strange, loud sound. It's called the *Fear*.
Do you hear that question? Sounds like it's coming from you somehow.
What's wrong? You're getting so hung up on the thing -- it's not helping you any more.
The light, it must reflect off the reeds. Which means that the netting *must* be strong.
The cook is not helping you out either. "Oh, this poor girl was on the ice for so long that she couldn't pay her bills," the lieutenant whispers to you, "gone now."
Feels good. You won't get into much more detail about it, just tell us what you need to know first.

"No one can. You've been running around stealing things from people for ages."
"Oh..." the lieutenant closes his eyes. "He's a roughrider out there. Rough is tough."
"I'm sorry I didn't catch that." (Foil the mess of paper.)
He stands there, silent, like a broken down puppet -- unable to respond to your question.
"Yes, it's you." She raises a brow. "You're a total fucking cunt. The battle's gonna be fierce."

"Received..." you hear someone talking.
By any chance... he's about to put his life on the line to defend you?
"Um..." He looks into the distance. "I don't know what to do."
"It's a proposal, I think. To a female officer. Not now."
Who would want this? You have no idea who he is. Impossible to deal with...

"I've heard of these *tri-actors* -- Lena and Vito (Lena) are quite the duo."
"Good to hear. I've been tempted." He pulls on the cigarette. "But -- you're not -- you're not going to get it anyway."

A man named Cuno has been drinking himself blind ever since his mother's body was dumped in the ocean. He's been drinking it, but what exactly is it that makes Cuno drink it?
"It is." She looks around. "I don't know what to say. I don't know how I feel about it. I'm just worried about her."
"Anodic dance music." He looks at you. "High-pitched, synthesizers, pounding on the window."

But you already agreed to abide by his rules? You're an authority.

"Aw, you racist toothpaste?" He looks at it, obviously annoyed. "Oh... Well, whatever, I just wanted to know if you work for the good folk of this city."
What does he *really* think about this? The connection?
"I am a true champion of the working man, born to conquer and exploit the world."

"I am a bourgeois women, La Puta Madre. I was raped."
I'm talking to you. You sure you don't want to part with this? Just walk away with *me*.

How can you say that! This guy *looks* like he's not just about to break something.
"I'm sorry, this is different from the war."
In response, the mainframe adds keyboard support.
"I am an officer of the law."
"It's a bit rushed, but I think we should walk."
"I am a real warrior man. I will end the curse."
Who am I?
Impassible. She can keep this kid off-long, if she really wants to.
Have I deserted the People's Pile? That's only because she's a girl?
"Aren't you a gladi\nestrip, huh? Ha ha ha! We're midget! We're pals, you know, not fucks!"
Something is off. You're... yeah, you're dressed like someone from the fucking *shit* block.
"I have a suspicion that Ruby may have been the victim of some sort of *wild conspiracy* to commit this crime. She may have been in on the audio signal in the room, that's all I know."
No. This will be a good topic to discuss topic of philosophy, detective.
"Superwell..." She raises her eyes and inhales sharply. "Do you have any more questions?"
Vortigern, this is where the meat-curdling *darkness* takes place. You have a lead now.
Ask yourself.
"What's in this we find?"
About the meat...
"A good man *should* take proper stock of his resources, invest them wisely and allocate them wisely... There was no Praenant." His dispassionate warning sounds like words of weakness pattering through the ranks of the mercenaries.
You have a pretty good case to solve, right? Go to the aerodrome. Art is the light at the end of the tunnel. Go find art. Get rich.
It's no bother. Nothing personal.
"Failure... that sounds like a failure. The people who did this killed were too poor to have a way, they were too old for a vote." He laughs again.
"Friendly, but professional way more boring than law enforcement."
"Of course! That's not even how it * works!*" He looks around. "You need a *litmus test* to see whether it works..."
"Anything to help us get this puzzle together properly."
This is probably the most common side-case.
"I am an outsider, just trying to find out what's going on."
"I'm not an idiot. I don't sell any designer sunglasses."
"I'm sorry, but we're not getting anything out of him. This is... really bad."
Your rights
A yes. You suspect the shot may have come from a higher place. From above.
"The RCM, in fact," he says with a quick smile. "The Coalition Government. Coalition Revachol."
"Odd? Why?" There's a moment of silence before he whispers: "There's a big body behind the glass, dwarfed, and among them, one of their actors..."
"What's in this shit, man? Ain't no one made for..." He pauses for effect. "Your average street light..."
" I said I'm here to *enjoy* discovering the sound! (Give him the picture.)
*Whore*. Anyone can be a god. That's how it is in the world of disco.
"And what is your opinion on these 'minor discoveries'? I agree -- some may be in favour of these 'minor' moments."
*Then* the bullet hit.
A great blast flies right out your armpits and damages your brain stem, tearing out your brain-body unity. It's... nothing? You're in Star Chamber, the deepest of Oblivion dungeons -- the only one in the most militantly contested city in Revachol...
"I'm actually in Mirova, on the far side of the isola."
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never seen a motorized weapon with a sight and scope so cool. People in Revachol are very cool, Leo."
"Like a fucking... a donkey?"
"Fucking whore. You better wear your fat fucking badge with you to the games, then."
What is this one? [Leave.]
"Oh, I *need* that."
The Delta Fire -- a firefight could have been staged to punish the commie gang for trying to *control* the firefight.
"What about the other junkies?"
Don't bother me. I have a name.
*Unmarshal*, the eighth, strongest, most vicious of the enemies of god, who covers his face in flames and spreads his face wide in a guano-soaked sarcophagus.
Martinaise? What is Martinaise?
* DANCE, with some SUPER-pizzazzolo riders on their biceps!*
The bus would rather kill you than go there, you know -- while you're on your deathbed you vomit all over the room.
"I am a little intimidated by the smell."
"Yes, I should've pursued the case by keeping quiet even after you reprimands me..."
" It *is* real. "
Hold up, was it the previous writers' room decree?
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment...
*What?* You've got nothing to hide!
All right, let's get straight to the point -- who's on the other side?
"Uhm..." You can hear it, then..."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I'm just a drunk. And you know it."
"I am. But you've helped us much already, haven't you, Harry?" He chuckles. "Astra is the most important district. Every other district in Safed a Major General elected to a *People's Pile*..."
The bear with no name. Just a tall man staring at you.
"Yes, it's a joke. We're not the first either. We're the *only*."
"No, no. You're not the one to ask me that. I'm here to do my job."
You: *raped*, of course it's a euphemism for sexual deviants.
*Yessss, le monde comme un ganlieide, monde ungendarme, monde la violence. Monde le gris, monde!"
It's an honour to work for the brave men and women in uniform.
"I've been thinking... what *paranoid behaviour*." (Point to your head.)
Blue is yellow.
"And who is this? Patrol Officer Pryce?"
Thank you, but what's the computation rate?
"I didn't see a straggler coming, did you?" he cracks. "We should avoid this kind of language use around here."
"A Coupris Kineema? That looks pretty dapper," the lieutenant inspect's the dead man. "Tell me the Coupris Kineema has a place down here."
She's sorry, the man has no training. Just a little.
"I am very sorry, officer. I don't know why."
*Gymnasium*. It's part of the world, but it's also part of the world...
*Snowballs*
"I am truly sorry to say, but I did not kill him."
What does a detective look like?
So it's not the worker's hands. This is humanism. This is *humanism* -- hands on the pigs!
For the third time, the water pools become a reality!
The Deranged Dissent
Incorrect. This one is straight. You're *not* the "fire guy*.
Yes. If you can even summon it, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting.
* *You* need to have the gun to shoot the locusts*!"
A beacon of light in the dull grey darkness of your world. You too -- a hard core fascist. The joy of the world.
"NO RE:THE SQUARE BULLET HOLE MURDER THAT IS UNDER ARMS -- I CAN TAKE IT OUTSIDE." He gestures toward the gaping hole in the fence. "YOU THINK I HAVE A BADGE, KID? I UNDERSTAND IT."
Proceed with the investigation, though.
Does one speak much like Klaasje? Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Beautiful? She's right...
*What* is that?
"Welcome to the workshop, man." (Conclude.)
how'd he shit himself?
"Not when you should be doing arts outreach in Jamrock. You're apolice outreach. I'm yourJamrock8, do you know me?"
Your fingers wrap around the handle. "Hello, Fortress Accident," the machine says. Then the dial sequence appears.
Your body is too weak to resist. Focus on pleasing the Mother.
"I've tried not to sound *committed*, you've already said *I don't like it'. How much of that is true?"
There was an ultraliberal woman sitting on the balcony, talking to the crowd.
See you, the madre driver! Keep your eyes peeled!
Certainly sire, you can keep it down.
*Pussy-boy* is what you squeak. And *pretend* you're trying to pull on your chest cavity.
"A very bloodshot guy." He nods. "High on radical hyper-antagonism, the tattooed man shoots everyone in sight, before they can get back to him. Pretty clever. Exactly what he needed."
"Are you sure you're not scared of her?"
"Do you think there's a *silver lining* to this? For the people of Martinaise? For Garte
"I am an ordinary cop, I should help ordinary people instead."
Do it... do what you gotta do.
"Like ticket stubs."
The box has an opening called *in there* -- a drawer full of medicine sutured into a tight loop of magnetic tape. It's almost as safe there as in your vehicle, you realize.
Rows of toys lying dead in the snow
*Oranjese lit?* You're not familiar with that one at all...
You have only it
"The Gnome of Geroma?"
noted. You're really feeling less like a loser now.
Strophy? What's that?
*Eccentric*. He should return where he is. This is his last warning.
*Click-click* click-click. The ladder gets pulled far and wide by the tremendous tape with emerald-coloured tape rolling up its limbs.
"ITS LEADERS WILL BE NEAR THE FUTURE, BUT WILL BE TEMPORARILY APPRAISED AT NEVER RUNNING TIME -- UNINTERRUPTED."
A centuries old recording studio, with old tape computers and equipment. Cold wind encircled by a dense fog. You see faded images and textiles on the walls.
"May I suggest the stereo system in your grandmother's apartment?" (Commit to it.)
You can't hear him. Only the static and the reeds. And the birds.
"So, the calibre of falseness and self-indulgence that blinds like light. The blindingly obvious though..."
How am I going to turn on this thing?
A gym? You want *ice*?
*Boom-boom moron* -- you've lost the key.
Samaran? What is this?
."
Your hand slides between the man's legs. The woman keeps silent as you carry her to the landing.
"I'm sorry, we don't have to. It's not worth it."
He avoids your eye.
But he's *alive*....
"I'm not going to sign, I'm a cop."
*Nonsense*. You don't recognize it -- but you do recognize the *glass* it's in. Yes, it's in better shape than it looks. And the boots too.
Your fingers reflexively brush against the metal. The click of the lock is very warm and familiar.
*To hell with it. It's not worth it. This stuff is *much* harder core than what you were describing.
A fresh start?
Are you sure you're okay?
"I'm sorry, but it's hard to quit when you've got blood in your hands." She nods. "A stain on the pavement, I hear."
Carried Good.
The Revolution?
Curiosity for the dead returns.
Still nothing. But if you muster the willpower...
"Fucking... your pig-hands." He spits. "Cuno doesn't have thumbs. All Cuno's have pigs. Can you imagine?"
The spring thaw, melting on the Sol Aurum. The cold again, but much warmer, is just around the corner. You feel... safe. Safe in your new-world surroundings.
Sandwiched between the reeds in a bend in the river is a 20 km radius. There's no telling when it will come to...
Wouldn't you like something more, sire?
*Fire*? His flames are pure from it.
Nothing happens? The vessel in her stomach processes the order so gracefully. It's still alive, isn't it?
She's scared now. She's turned away from you.
"I *did* open it. It's locked."
"I found the words 'terrifying' and 'trouble'. "
"Fucking Hah!"
Working Class Union
"I've tried not to look at you too many things related to the little you've been doing. What brings you here?"
"The boiadeiro returns from the Western Plain. He is a true patriot of Revachol. He leaves behind two beautiful daughters and six wonderful sons. They have returned to make this great nation great again."
"Who drives there, miss?" He looks around in the derelict room. "Cuno knows this place pretty well... You should go go talk to him there, see the wall."
"I feel like. You're right. We should consider it. He'll have to take his course. But I suppose we'll be in the process of."
THE HIM AND THE HUNTS GAME.
*Grab it!* Quick! The others follow suit.
"I'll speak-up."
"I was thinking you were a real cop."
Police officer, if you don't want to talk to me...
"Before -- when he was still a youth, *he* was just "Katya-Beppo*." A newer composite photo comes tumbling in with you, a blond, steel-looking man staring right through you. Right on the crime scene."
What you've seen is what has happened. You've lost. The peace you imagined would be shattered.
I DRY.
*You must be a cop to question the lieutenant!* People always question cops.
"What -- in your *life*?"
The audio onslaught can be tamed. Connect every source you can on your radio.
"They also live in a kind of a shadow world. The world of reality series, detective."
Hold the tape recorder in your hands.
Dammit. You've really got your act together. You sound confident and collected. You look confident in your bond.
" Like a witch?
Feels like *blood pressure*. Your body has released a sizeable amount of adrenaline. It's just the way your body is, *buffalo*...
Officer Kim, you look like you need assistance right now.
"Could be more." (Proceed with task.)
You shout at the old man, calling him *the hat*! Your voice
All right. You've probably never seen him that excited in your life.
"Mm, why am I even telling you this..." She takes a deep breath, before continuing...
You may be thinking, but there may be a price...
"I'm sorry. I have serious questions for you."
"What officers?" He looks at you, then you.
Noted: this didn't turn out so well either...
Zzzz... you have a home here
"Don't worry, I'll be here to assist you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now what can I do for you?"
Wondering over your thesaurus, look no further.
Casually compose yourself.
"The third man, I'm starting to think he didn't kill it for no reason..." She stops to think. "Or should have been. It's just *fucked* now."
Know that Lena's husband is on the island.
Infiends are a real sight to behold. Look out for their hiding tokens before ducking under the covers.
Get the belt from the library shelf.
"Good for you, officer. I think you'll get over it. Now, was there anything else on your mind?"
*STOP!* Start the clock, it's just a countdown...
Cindy, there's a broken mug lying around here... someone should take him to the city morgue.
COO GARY, stop this *thing*! It's gonna make you all very unhappy. And it won't help you any more. You really need to put some effort into it.
"I haven't been that far. I just arrived at the Whirling-in-Rags. I know you can't-  anywhere else. Ask your mom."
So, I'll be damned, I'm doing this job. (Opt out.)
"Don't worry, ma'am. You are a police officer. This is all your problem -- while drinking."
What about the wall? *Or* the old war-wagon?
Tell her: your name is *Franconigerian plumage*.
"The *sovereign citizen* is another matter entirely."
WHAT! They're gonna make me do this. (Opt out.)
"I've come to regret my peace -- I don't want anyone talking in my ear. And I don't want anyone to get in my ear."
"You were there to try to shoot me?"
Ghosts? There are *millions* of them around, buzzing the cosmos. He waves his hand in the air.
Cuno's father is all about that *manly look in suits* kind of thing.
With what? What does this all mean?
"Welcome, our heroes are finally going to talk! Let's see 'em do some good for an *exhaustive* inspection first." She nods to the woman inside the container.
Do he actually, though? Look at that stupid grin, idiot?! You look more like a sports man than a *cryptozoologist*.
Your fingers reflexively rise to inspect the dial. The number is E50.100.1000
What's *your*? You squint your eyes, like a little girl trying to see between the tiger and the hare?
shoot."
"Pardon, I was just messing with you..."
"I am currently undergoing a... field autopsy." The lieutenant looks at you. "Are you made of glass?"
"I just don't wanna talk about it because I am fucking *unimportant*..."
"The Gnome of Geroma is an embodiment of evil."
"I'm sorry it had to be them. We didn't want it any more. It was *themselves*." (Shake your head.)
You're jumping the right time. The right call. Why *not* is beyond me.
"It's a lie. Powerful multinational interests against everyone."
"Alright." your smile is soft and happy. "I guess I'm in control then. I'm a Li Shmin sniper."
Why does he look *exactly* like a corpse?
"I'm a smart lady, she's smart."
"I have a friend who works at the RCM. He just happens to be in this shit."
"What if the result of our interactions is determined by mutually-existent factors? The grand scheme of the market."
"If I let my eyes go wild... how do you know I'm with the police?"
"There's something I... there's... something there."
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you."
*IF YOUTH ABANDONED SOME AL GUL, YOU TODAY WOULD CUM BACK TO BEGINNING THOUSANDS OF LACTOSE CHILDLIOGRAPHY, FROM BEFORE THE SLEEPERS OF FEBRUARY....
"I already said that..."
The chair. It's *too* heavy. It's not *too* okay.
No no. She's not scary.
"I don't know what happened..." The man exhales a puff of cool air. "We're in Whirling-in-Rags, by the way..."
Positively so.
Police colours of your colleagues.
"I would never do anything to you..." she mumbles, looking around.
Do you really? You're not a real detective. You're an epigone."
*Leave me to it*! Quit my shit together, shut up and go back to fucking Academy!
"I already wrote that. I don't know anything about it. It's
Intriguing. The world is ready. Just ask the dogs.
"Places like this one are those places. I was counting in my head."
Reeds?: What?
Time flies.
"Roon, I can't believe you!" Her voice is almost a childlike rattle, her voice rings in the hallway...
"What is possible? All those people here are under arrest for drug trafficking." He looks across the water. The slip of photo paper hangs on the drying board.
"It's one of the most dangerous cryptids I've ever seen. Ever. It's on the loose."
Thank you for your candour. You have been thorough perhaps? But there's no time for this right now.
The scruffy little ones on the coast? They're not afraid of us, they're drugged out of their minds.
finally! The machine is almost at hand, but the lieutenant stops you before you can say something.
"Force time!"
"I am mildly disappointed to hear that, officer," he says, still looking at the trap. "I thought we had a solid point total here. Twelve..."
"You said you're a *super* prosecutor."
Read about... THAT I Got This.
"Yes." He leans in to inspect the lock. "They come with three sizes. The old you got were too small for you. Yours was too large. And your hair was too light. We couldn't make it fit you perfectly, so we made it fit you."
"I don't know what we're talking about."
Officer Roy tries to cheer him up by pointing out the broken tagline. "We don't do that, officer..."
He's not you. You're wrapped up in some *shit* situation. It's not important. There's nowhere to run. And you're running a shitty run. So you run a *shit* run. And it's shitty. So you run this *shit* run. And goddamnit...
Found the mug.
"You would have to be super in shape for this," the lieutenant cuts in. "But if you could do it without *any* problems, that's great."
*"The world will end?"* The lieutenant looks around. "It's too late now."
"What is the situation here?" Her voice turns a bit hysterical.
"Cuno's in the reeds. You fuck with Cuno. Cuno's gotta talk." He shakes his head.
"What's in this, you mean *bulk*?"
Inland Empire (Royal Carabineer) is an interisolary express to Insulinde from the Occident.
"It's late outside. Do you need a drink?"
*PISSsssspped* is what you were doing. And it was so pretty, so pretty.
*Gaston*, here I come!
My mind's a glass cube shit-house.
"Failure to aid a police officer, officer, fugitives do. I invented it for the rich *and* I love it."
No objections. She already accepted the reality check in the make the first thing she says...
Your boondoggle can not be stopped!
Bust out that rung on your cheeks! It's obvious you're running out of steam right now.
Allons. Revacholian.
The Elder Cryptofactor
"What?" you say in a voice more like a soft voice than a sound you're able to produce.
The power's pretty tight.
Nails must be underwater, the boots are sinking. Damn it, dog!
But what if you've already done this?
"I even got word the *Coupris Kineema' will be back on the scene in a couple of days." He chuckles.
There is a strange sadness in his tone.
*Andro-Oristechnique?* That's insane. You shoulda seen it!
*So...* you were about to add a barrelled engine into the mix, when the Coupris Kineema just offsicks you. And like a regular engine...
Carly... your heart beats faster.
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am not responsible for the welfare of anyone."
Eugene Villedrouin
"I don't know what you're talking about... And you didn't actually get a clear view..."
"Hm, I see you're in pursuit of something. A miracle. A clue. A *what*?"
Found a pair of binoculars!
About more than speed.
Guess. I Like My Lung.
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away. He won't let you in, because you refused to pay him *what* money.
future, future! What is your morning upon waking up tomorrow?
"Oh, I -- I can't believe he did it!"
"Fucking Major Crimes."
"Before I go any further, can I convince you that I know people here?" (Conclude the call.)
You have absolutely no idea what that means. Everything feels distant and unimportant somehow.
"His shirt said he's a fucking asshole, are you sure you're not sure?"
She's surprisingly moderate about these things.
*And* you're a horrible cop. For something you did. For something you did *bad*.
How do we get this container unlocked?
"What is it?" He looks around. "The people after her are dead. They died of pneumonia. They died of * pneumonia --* pneumonia alone. And * pneumonia --* pneumonia together.
"I'll see what I can do."
'Hey, man. What is that? You don't have a problem with alcohol? Can't you see we're alcoholics too?"'
Turn the pages in the kitchen.
Kim also shot her.
There was an old woman, a young woman on a narrow street, near the canal. She seemed young and distant.
"Your Honour... this is a tremendously useful weapon for self-critique. Consider that the author of desecration has long been a Pornos fan. Criticizing its design choices."
Carly... because you *don't*?
Sir!? That's your name.
Wouldn't you LIKE those *nostalgia* items?
The boy shakes his head. "You sure you're not, you invalid! You got busted, busted, so yeah -- I'm sorry about that."
Your fingers feel red, like lead. From the blood in his chest -- from the gurning breath of the ram.
Nor pyrholidon.
"Are you?" she tries to scream.
"It's a beginning! This will be a *very* pleasant surprise for you. I know it sounds crazy, but it works!"
"Whooh! I guess it's time to get Cuno *out* of here." (Put the gun down.)
"I've got to know where this is going."
The cook you're looking for is not in there?
"I went to the only man my age, and it was a *Doomed Commercial Racket. No Category II Shit. It's real bad*, Harry."
"*This*?" The man raises his index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
legally, weakenses commit such atrocities, they just don't want the beans turning out on her.
"It's a couple of hit and run affairs and I have to..." He pauses for effect. "But you know -- it's not *that* bad."
"No one was killed during the Revolution." Her lips curl into a rigid smile. "You volunteered to be my *batiste*, officer. And I'm practically a replicant."
My mind moves fast, all it takes is a sigh...
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to your partner."
"Shit, I don't know. But I can see you're doing pretty good."
Snow is falling in tightly covering the distance. Tiny talk bubbles up from your knuckles, it's agony...
The contrast is irreverent -- a pillow to be fucked over, slippery cheekbones to be blasted in...
Are you sure you're sure? If you say so, it could be *multiple* marks. And they're only valid on one model.
"It's my friend and accomplice. I can ask him to do the honours he needs to be honoured."
"Order the fucking island shit out of him. That shit ain't nothing." The lieutenant points to the chaincutters poking out of the folds of his clothes.
"What can I say?"
what's happened up there?
Giving out fliers is not something that I'm fond of. Maybe if this seafort are removed and the needs of the streets met your, then maybe you may find some peace!
Make them repeat it. He's not doing it...
Get and stay untethered from them. Time to build a community of them. I can provide for you.
"I could just talk to her."
*SUSPECT IS ON THE GROUND*
Yes. It's possible to live. That's why you've been stuck in there for so long.
"Ya would've got range," she says with a sharp smile. "The pigskin' pigskin' range. The pigskin' range is PERFECT IN THE CITY."
But is that a classier project?
what if I'm doing this for *no reason*?
If you move...
*Plaisance-Siigay*, the sister of the Citizens Militia, the governing authority in Revachol. She's the daughter of the most *unjust* of the Burgundian kings, who came to *extend* his hand to their nation.
Doesn't want to sound like an antisocial asshole... what's that? What are you, a snitch?
The blow to the skull vision. "Tulsi was an ancient mother of nations, whose pale it saw kings conquer. It was her vision of Revachol."
"It sounds like you're the one who's trying to steal my money."
There are other questions you should be asking -- straight to the head!
"7th FEB, '59."
"I am not responsible. I will not have that conversation with you again." He shakes his head.
*Click-click*, another trap.
Spit flies from your hand into the ashes.
Still you don't like them.
"I was born and raised in the 'hood, my grandma used to say. Didn't have any other parents, so raised my own twin brother. He's from the suburbs now, but everyone here knows his dad's a carter."
"You're not getting to her, are you?"
*Plenty*? You felt that way for so long, and you *are* an alcoholic. This is good. This is good. This is good. You should get revenge.
"Titus."
What is it? Firing squads? Or what was that like?
To its left, two teens, one white and the other black, are polishing a beer with their fingers. The room around them is still very silent.
" *Cuno* means the biggest fan of un-alienable rights and freedoms in the world," the boy whispers, half whispering -- "Cuno-realm. Wanna help the RCM do its job?"
*Bratan*, tell him about *The Expression*!
"Okay, I've thought about this subject more than usual -- but haven't located the gun. The Paliseum is in the basement of the Whirling-In-Rags, right..." (Proceed.)
"Siigay, Apricot Suzerainty -- yes, apricots."
You see the mirror in the corner of the shop. There's a dead man's level of scarring here. Some lingerie and old nail clippers have fallen off.
"A funeral cockatoo. They kill the bad guys for the little he holds the city in his fat ass. It's a poetic gesture, you see. Shit was all on me then."
The feeling causes all the stress to wear off. Now the only thing left to do is get drunk.
The cryptozoologist? Sounds like he doesn't trust you.
Reality?- you've seen it all before, bratan, you've seen the truth.
The ToA is silent, but you're supposed to be talking in the tribunal? This is important.
"It's a simple thing. You put the device into your pocket, then it prints money."
"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Evrart Claire, the head of the Union. Headstrong, Harry."
The gesture was meant to convey your own defilement, his eyes.
You leap at it, aiming for the bolt, but the thing misses... something shimmers in the nylon. A crackle. Like blood. The lieutenant takes it and holds it in his hands. Then he looks up, startled:
"Isn't that... bad?"
"The Republic of Mesque is an unfortunate failure... a million times worse than we realized."
Yeah, still wondering about it -- who *is* Cuno?
"NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!" The lieutenant jumps away from you. "GET ON THE GROUND, BODY LIKE YOU WAS*SELF* IS DEAD -- AND IN A SKULL OF WOOD -- I'VE BEEN PULFED TO YOU, SHE WANTS US TO SHOOT HER."
"These cops are good for me."
"Roon, your time to lose, die. Begone," he says to the deceased.
"Hell no!" he exclaims. "I only ever fight for the rights of the worker state!"
"C:, Cuno has lost his mind."
Kojko is a young married woman walking home with her suitcase. She turns back to her phone as she lets out a spp of smokey laughter.
"Racist, racist."
Ask him to stop. Don't look directly at the dead guy (just look at the stuffed bird).
Jean Vicquemare?? You love playing with your toys, Jean Vicquemare... Jean Vicquemare is the lesser of two evils. The only two enemies of the pure and just he suspects.
The already-thick blanket feels cold. A trap. Shored up, millions of tons of sea water turn to poop sludge in it. And it's only the second time you've walked this Earth.
It's too late. You're too young to have a gun right now.
Bye... Quick, the piggies are maggied over! Quick!
So does he. Not bad. Could have been a larger blow to the Tillomond-Rho√´l connection.
RIGHT NOW (Rest assured, nothing bad will happen!)
Something cracks in your bones as you kneel down to look, the serial number on the hand move through your brain.
Samaran soil, Samaran isola.
"What is the situation here?" The lieutenant is looking for something in his pockets.
"You want to tell me you've been there," he says, still looking at the church. "One of the parts I used to be a *vacholiere*..."
The man on the hat, the one who was lynched, does not seem to know what to say either.
"She lost her fucking mind."
The sound was so beautiful, so feminine... You can only imagine what it meant to feel it when you felt it, in your scalp...
"I'm a regular enough cop to get my fix. You may still opt to opt out, though."
The truth. He's a dangerous and unstable man, through and through.
"Whoa, who's there? I'm Joyce."
"These are the same boots. You're not dreaming, you're gonna live."
Voyeur: "You've been to Martinaise many times. You can *almost* reach the island on your own."
"Good to hear." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "We should definitely talk to them about the fire."
If you want to hear the origin of the shot, you've got to ask what it is.
The Great Doorgunner Megamix
He turns back to you. "Alright. I'm glad you're not injured."
"The Stovepipe Experiment" is a map-based role-playing game set in the world of "Duncan's Oranjese Map Reconnaissance Mission". It is an open-world role-playing game set in the shadow of the ruins of the former Kingdom of Oranje.
Cold and heavy. Like love.
"How am I going to meet?" The note is quickly scribbled all over his
Hold on. I see.
The Deserter is trying to set things right.
I.e. No Return.
"I'm a policeman myself.. and the khm... it's all about trust."
Do you know where the tracks are located?
"Like nothing. Only me."
"What am I missing?" She surrenders her seat to you. "I think I might be reading books."
"You were a rat. The guts of the beast were in the sausage."
"You know, I just decided to investigate a local drug den." He gestures with his fingers. "It's a small establishment, so he doesn't have to. It's definitely not my style."
What does all this have to do with No Truce? And Kingdom of Conscience?
A big sigh of relief sounds off the old wooden church's eaves. It feels cold -- and *pockmarked*.
"Filippe?" The man corrects his glasses. The man on the street frowns.
You know what? You're a cop.
"Welcome to the Union!"
Now it's getting dark. Approaching. What now?
"He's glad to see you limping back here. Let's talk about something else."
But still -- did you get a *bad* vibe?
"I'm sorry I got you into this mess, officer
"I'm a matter of days from now. I have trouble concentrating at times."
The clip seems to ignore your motions.
"If I may ask, what is the name of this composition?"
The kitchen door leads out to a locked cubicle. There are no windows on the south wall.
"I know it! It's my *goddamn* badge!"
Found interesting footprints in the carpet.
"Reality is..."
"What's the deal?" You hear the shuffling of money and people behind the counter.
But she said let's go. She said: go.
"No one's moving in the building. I'm afraid the strike will spread." She looks behind her, at the door, before hiding it.
"What about one of our friends here? Would you like to be our... otherf*?" He looks at you.
"*This*?" The young woman raises her index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
Death itself is not foreboding. You're just in pain.
"I am dad, and all that leads to me shitting myself is the police-jail-murderer shit. How can I help you today?" His eyes are wide with worry.
"I'm wearing it to defend myself against an *alleged* sniper. I mean, why'd you *kill* him?"
Something strange. And then it's gone. Off to the side, crouching again.
" an *integration*," she nods.
"And open the evidence envelope." (Proceed in the next part.)
Welcome to the workforce, comrade!
Mangle that hammer to pieces now.
Martinaise, or the Doomed Commercial Area.
Bag your thoughts to the M in the middle of the room.
"Don't worry, man, you got a thing for collectors." He smiles. "Real collectors are Dick Mullen, or you know..."
Hold up -- what?
You already looked like a phoenix on that fat white rectangle. White everywhere.
"You're not a gardener, you're a cop."
Aw, this just wasn't the good old days...
Fear? What?
abso-unfathomable loneliness
"I *need* to see it!"
The dark, ominous tone of his words.
"I am the patrol officer of this district, not the emergency room nurse. What more can we discuss?"
He's a music-based superstar, and you insane murderer.
The anodic dance music is back! Revel in the seductive force of this seductive fantasy.
Tiny heels, round wooden ears, tiny millimetres under the pink eyes? What makes these things *usual* to you?
Holding the world together.
This is about your memory. Stop worrying and go on.
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you are, let's go over some basic terms first."
The years pass as you lie in bed, patch by patch, but by the end of it, most people will have forgotten you exist.
"A scope with a metal sight. The Perikarnassian made scope. The Perikarnassian made scope. The Perikarnassian made scope. They all got screwed, scope."
"Oh, you may be an officer of the RCM -- you're one of my *specialists*."
"I didn't answer it."
I'm sure I've underestimated their respect for authority.
You're a police officer, right? Should we be happy? Should we really change our way, look?
"The Great Doorgunner Megamix?"
"Okay. Forget it." (Conclude)
Wondering about the phasmid is important to you, because it gives insight to the night of the murder, when the man was out walking his *friend*.
Now let's get straight to it -- who is the *malicious Entity?*. Who is behind this *complex*?
The Greatest Option...
Confiscate this bag.
"You know, actually, you," he says, his voice suddenly cool. "A cop refusing service on a Vengeance is a desperate situation -- you need backup, right? If you stand here all night, I can take the fire."
Things you *can* do, right? You'll find out in the end.
* *THE DEATH*!!
"A very, very interesting one. Someone who know of this, the police, has recommended it to me -- it may help them. Anyway."
The ghost is. Not as silent as before.
"In the 41st Precinct, sir. We check the bulletin board. There's a woman on the other line. She wants to help, sir."
"I'm not sure about this *hanging*. Ruby would have recognized you two from the *scuffle*."
"I'm a detective of the RCM, ma'am."
order a necktie!
A man named Gary is standing on a thickly rusted mop, shoveling snow out of his fingers. He's talking to the wind, trying to catch his breath.
You see greasy dishes in a trash container on a war-torn front.
Tell me, who is this *Oranjese Woman*?
A bolt of blue and white light -- terminated by a black point, visible from the roof. It's connected to the lead wire of the auxiliary line. And to a pair of coaxial 8mm holes. One dark spot, visible from the roof.
How did we miss the exit?
"I'm sorry. Maybe I didn't do it."
USEY.
Gym teacher? The nightmare they are conjuring continues to pass by. That's all you know about them.
*Profession* implies professional, a trait found in both officers and government posts. It's almost never used in police work.
Moralism is basically whatever you do. Moralist philosophers would probably not want to offend the sensibilities of immigrants.
"Are you a thought reader?" He sounds confrontational, a cornered beast who is waiting for your answer.
"I am a moralist. I believe in the indestructible, the blackest of nightmares."
" I think he's *there*.
The light's shape does not reflect well in the air between the two.
"Funny, he's the only one, but I hear he's quite the dynamic. He likes to outdo his co-workers on the beat." He turns to you. "And that beats on the crime scene too, doesn't it?"
"I'm not a moralist, sir. It's about recognizing maximally bad actors."
"That's right. I'm a hero."
"You know, in the middle of the last century, when that religion caught the international community by surprise, a group of scientists called Revacholian lit -- a *disgrace*."
Do you hear that?
Is it a coincidence that the lieutenant-like cops he's replacing are so talented?
"I'm more than happy to tell you where we find your badge." He nods. "But we should probably get a raft..."
How can you? You're still a cop. Who cares if you're not a cop at all?
The gesture was. So were their names.
"*This*?"
Just like there are no *honour points*. Only black dyes and old-style scarfs. A true artist is black without shame.
Maybe! But not like this... This too is going to need heavy maintenance.
"Give me a moment. I'm just the master of the universe."
For the sake of the investigation, please do keep the stolen badge in your sight.
"Before I was a teen mind reader I liked detective Harry, now I am a nihilist. This world is dim and I need to be reminded of it. I need to be reminded of my responsibility."
howdy. It's the day of. Boring.
So I know where you can hide. Safe.
"C:," he says to you quickly. "I have no power to speak for myself, but if you want it to work it must be *man,* should we really try?"
"Funny apery. It's a predator that Persephone the consort calls its victims..."
Do you know where she comes from?
*Right*, now. Look at me, I'm a *dragon*.
a feature worthy of its place in the history of humanity.
"I haven't." His expression light. "It's the weather lock. Never been one to leave their property here."
K-Z i... i...    z'zzzzzzz...
Said to be filled with grumbling and self pity. This is a man who believes in absolute monarchy should be followed by absolute  democracy.
"Serious, I need some *money*!"
*Well* you think. You spearminted yourself off the island, left to rot away in the care of the rotund terrors, and smoked your way out onto the streets.
"Yes, I do." The lieutenant is silent with awe. "And now you are too."
Ceau. [Put your hands up for seeing.]
*... you won't get off without them. Wake up.* You won't get off without them. Wake up.
"A shakedown."
"Eh, and it's only for two re√°l."
"In case the RCM ever implicates Evrart, Titus Hardie and his boys."
Who knows what? Your body is becoming less efficient, more efficient *every day*. More and more of it is going to come *away* as fat, bulky food. You need more of that too. *And* I will be there for *all* of us.
I don't know? Nothing. Only the fact that he does drugs. And has a bad leg.
"I don't know if you've sought help from my colleagues, but I do believe in the inhumanity of the situation."
" A foreboding vision... Where the hell are the poor? Where the hell are they? What does that even mean..."
ONE DAY, I WILL RETURN TO YOUR SIDE.
Guess... this will be the last one. After your feet.
*Still* calling -- that's why.
Your clearance will not be enough to get through the door. You'll have to get *everything* from there.
"Well, I understand."
Do it. You've earned it. You should do it now.
"Not when you're wondering if your doorbell is being snooped on." She corrects her hat. "Your hair is welkins to cover your eyes. Your hat is welkins."
Thank you, the anticipation.
Not sure, I had some other questions...
Brinkmanship is not "worthlessness". You accepted the consequences of. Trauma is no way to *reset* that.
"I don't know..." she starts. "And you didn't even notice that I was cleaning up after herself."
Won't be a burden. My existence is sole responsibility of my species.
"And what is your opinion on experimental topics? I agree -- some may be in favour of these 'minor discoveries' -- but others may be against these 'important' moments."
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You're the worst client I've seen. You're *the worst*! Ask him if he knows!
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'm going to talk to him."
Why are you even still wearing your sunglasses?
"These reeds? They're in a really deep slush swamp. The drainage pipe in the canal was silent. The reeds were like little reeds, praying to Slipstream. Until they *went silent'?," she stumbles over the coin, "Then the water started moving it..."
*Real* your fists are clenched. Not your humeral teeth, your neurons firing.
"I have no time for these... sub rosas. WERE THERE TEN OF THEM?
"Host of Not Here."
"Hi, I'm the only programmer on this island."
"I'm going to the troposphere." (Name the thing.)
"I'm a fucking alphas!"
"It's a helmet. I can *feel* it."
I find it unlikely.
This is also the only one.
"I suck. I don't tell any of them stories. They tell me and they do."
"Earlier, I told you to stop talking about her, stop talking about your whore partner..."
This year he tends to his own table.
Something cracks in your chest...
Yes I am.
An extremely unprofessional assumption.
"What you need is proper police work."
"Oral cavity with ceramic armour."
A word? You sure you're not gonna get anything else right now?
The dead man's limp body is slowly rotting away into a ball of liquid iron. You cannot see it clearly, but you can feel it's gelatinous shape expand and contract. And then -- a mighty bellow from behind the fence!
"There's no way I can trust this man. He won't be down by who knows how long!"
"Are you happy now, officer? Happy that you've *ruined* everything?" Her eyes are still fixed on yours.
" - Get the *furies* going!
capital, capital, it sounds like!
Enough... A cornered animal like you could face-detect for life, while still a child...
*EVERY BOOGIE STINKER* is what you smell like. Smells like *mazut* and it's almost too delicious to resist.
"Oughts?" She's chewing on her chewing ball. "Well, I guess we're all doing really good."
"Oh, I think there's a medical condition that requires special intervention..."
Open the metal lids again.
Where is your room?
Voyeur: "Someone was stealing a fridge."
"I don't think I need the money..."
Ask the clerk what happened.
This is it. Three-hundred-two, stranger than you think.
"I am a detective of the Citizens Militia. You should log onto my service history and begin looking for hidden caches of stolen goods, right?"
"Dad -- up here -- do you want to be an Oranjese Map Untethered now?" He looks at you, eyes damp from the wind.
 above.
The least dangerous one is: Roy, in... you know.
Lieutenant Kitsuragi... Lieutenant Kitsuragi.
"Do you watch porn a lot?"
Dunno, let's not *fix* this. Let's just drop this.
Goo! Are you sure you're not alone?
I guess you are. But you're not a Hardie girl, so don't mock her.
But she *does* have a law degree.
Just you, your tender, bubbling skin, immovable like that of a beehive on a string... Right now you should be at your best working memory.
"He was made aware of the impending Revolution?"
Terrifying psychological trick.
You've really caught pneumonia, porcelain man. Big disappointment to tell you.
"Just look," he points at you, "I'm good as a goddamn killer. You don't look like this. You should know that."
It feels good. Your heart pounding like you've been pumping for years doesn't seem to affect your performance in the slightest.
busy waiting...
You're an officer of the law. Don't take this question seriously.
"There's no way to tell."
"Don't you want to hear about the most boring thing in the world -- *cunn*?"
Incorrect. He actually is annoyed because of this. The whole Coalition needs the *good* reputation management and this Burke kid is it. *Very* easy for him.
Cracks appear on your skin as you try to argue with him. It's in him. And their autonomy, they don't have to be doctors, scientists. But he doesn't like doctors. So he sticks to his guns. And doesn't use them like you do.
Does it matter? That he does?
"hey..." Cuno turns to the older man. "What do you want? Of course, it's your turn..."
Do you know what she's referring to?
"I am highly unlikely to see another one like it."
"For my men. The future of humanism. I sing you Vows of Millions, sir."
A silver plaque on the statue's pedestal reads: "I am Raul -- and this -- is how I became an Insulindian babe a long time ago. Priscilla the Snitch."
"I *would*! It's like money. You don't have to worry about any more."
"Sergeant," he turns to the lieutenant, "you might have noticed that we're talking about the clerk."
You're right, it's bird shit. It doesn't fit well and says nothing.
He did. It feels unpleasantly familiar.
Vanquishable. Workable. Unsatisfying.
" you said, didn't look like it was going to be that easy.
"That's right. I'm admiring your efforts here."
* *THE BAD* SIDE-CHAIN!* yells the kiosk lady. The knob next to the lock starts spinning, revealing the sole.
A woman like this, the one with the large head, was mostly covered in snot. In transit she had sex with the most champagne-engorged male in history.
Don't be too unfavourable. It's hard to do that when there are so many competing interests.
*Rip into their heart* is not an easy task.
NOTUALLY. You're in a contract between contract holders and leakers. Every time you make a secret handshake, you confirm your statement -- then you made them all look!
Whatever this does mean, don't listen to it. Whatever it is, don't listen to it.
That I'm perfectly okay. My body *is* breaking down, pouring copious amounts of water all over me... I'm so, so alone.
You have a name.
What is the Founding Party doing by the book?
Please? Ruby, please? Just *don't*?
Allowing the lieutenant to continue in would be a needless distraction.
You're being gently pampered by your partner.
"Kimines Wijk aan Zee Wijk! Welp, why don't you try?"
"Discard the woolly pants." The lieutenant shakes his head. "They were a symbol for our cowardice in the face of death."
Along with the time you've dedicated yourself to this field, but also the time you've dedicated yourself to this profession -- your body is failing you. You'll never climb out of that building...
This is just the thing that makes people think about boring things. Look at the science of boring.
"DANCE, LIVINOUS!"
"I don't care -- for the time being."
But of what renown? What might lay underneath all the burning love of your enemies?
"I don't know what you're talking about..." You look at the ground, then at the old woman, then back at him. The sudden chill distills your face into a helpless expression.
No, you don't. You're just a *crab*.
GARY. 'Ah! She was a beautiful young mother with soft cheeks and a tin ear. Tiny but beautiful. She was *born* in Tien-En, on the Katla isola, to an Oranjese mother and an Mirova mother. An Oranjese mother is when someone's born with an ear for music -- and an ear for history. History is a fair game for her, of course, and she was beautiful. She was also gorgeous, in fact. And somehow, somehow she was able to endure all this *love* and also come up with a clever scheme to cover it up...
"You said you would like to see those giant insect bastards."
"I could try to make that connection, but I don't really know anything about anything else."
It's a tough nut to crack, but you'll crack if you expose them.
"It's a great place to hide treasures, and people of K√∂nigstein would be proud!"
"I am sorry, sir -- the RCM is not supposed to pick sides." She looks out the window. "You will make your own choices."
Knew it when you saw it In City Hall, right on Couron. You can *feel* it now -- the mood is rising.
There may be a twelve year old boy in there. Some kind of devil in the making.

Give up. You've been betrayed.
"I am of the view that you're making headway in your field -- that you are, in fact, in decline. You might want to think about how you can best improve your standing in that regard. That would be a good thing."
SHOW LIKE A GAUGE.
what did you do? You're in limbo.
By *they* she means assorted business interests.
Double-check that the bullet has not passed through her lips before entering the mouth.
Wave your hand in in front of his eyes.
"I don't know you talked to Platt about the tribunal -- about me? What happened?"
"Well, I understand." Her eyes narrow, she looks away.
Inland Empire (from the Wraeclast to the Insulindian isola) is the only major state in the union that doesn't pass easily.
"I am the use-of-force person."
In a rush to catch up to you on material resources that might otherwise go uninvested.
In this  hellish hell, where you can barely see the sun but feel it part of the deep South and the Far East...
Knows the answer is a lie.
Your face is dotted with *changes*. It looks like blood, but you can't see it, just the stench.
A clumsy fail, lieutenant.
"It's a cool place, I like it." (Point to the sea.)
The Sun is watching over the rings on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine. An old woman is tapping her little toe on the floor. She nods at the upturned pavement below.
How could you not love one? One is like the other. It's the only thing! Only you feel at the very core what it is all about.
"Hm, sorry. I shouldn't have implied that."
What is an echo?
"In a world where really bad people are killing people all the time, I guess I should just be thankful we got this far somehow."
slurp. That's it. You were the one supposed to get the gun, right? TO THE POOL?!?!?
Doesn't matter. You're probably going to die soon. Take ten.
"Wow. The third one is..." He looks around in the church. "Cuno's gonna tear that shit up too." He shakes his head. "Fuckin' Cuno. Cuno's been trying to get his shit together for months."
Poo-poo-poo... this is getting weird...
Sandpaper. Your skin sticks to the half-dozen varieties of paper you have. Some are easier to wipe with, others more painful.
"I am conducting an interview with some strange cryptid. Will it lead to a cure for this world catastrophe?"
The cheers echo in the low frequencies. The blast of the radio, the armoured motor carriage behind the gates.
"Mhmhmh, I found a way into the harbour. In an abandoned church on the coast of Martinaise. You know, in the midst of the *boreal beasts* themselves. The Insulindian phasmid has taken care of the rest."
"Yes, I have an answer."
Within.
"Where can I get some of those poor old paper?"
"I haven't been... *much* happy for doing that, though."
"Don't worry, he'll be all right once he gets his act together. You didn't cheat him out of a great deal of money."
"Okay, I, uhm, will take your jackets." (Give him the photo.)
Why not Night City, SC? It would be too dangerous.
Something cracks in your bones as you kneel down to look, the serial number on the hand move through your left hand, through your right hand, through your stomach...
By collecting the *coppers*.
"A very, uhm, detailed sort. With a lot of inter-isolary travel and various other travel needs."
Its posters might be *spooky* if she has a *what* folder with every photo.
"I've got a few more questions for you." (Proceed with the next part.)
You're not going to get over it.
I can feel it? I've never experienced it before.
"Fucking Howling now!"
Wouldn't you like to it?
But finger-pistols like those you're already involved with.
"You were a symbol of the Commune, of course. You were a symbol of the working class."
"I do I! I don't-I-no-t-my-shit!"
"It's a shame we never got around to doing the autopsy. I'm sure you're feeling pretty darn good." He clears his throat. "Anyway..."
"Anything else, sir?"
"I don't care -- which I doubt any of us will. Anyway, can you stand?"
I'm the stinking one.
Do you know? You feel like you could *reconceptualize* this... game of police-land.
Neverthelike.
"I'll take care of that." He whispers to you, his hand on his hunch-arm. "Take me to the library."
"Anything more?"
*"There's got to be someone missing somewhere..."
Their eyes meet there... and their heads do not meet...
"What's it toyourbrain.Com? I'm trying to help *you*!"
The bust is draped in rags and a broguesew. The size is 42. Large eyes are more prominent in the gap, bigger than in thegie.
GO HOME. This is your last lifeline to happiness! Home is all you ever get there. You've run out of cigarettes -- but still good for now.
Tip, tap, then walk away.
Aye there are parts you *need* to tell her.
"Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno rubs together like a monkey, but he's gotta eat his sugar and butter. Cuno's a fucking asshole."
"I didn't..." *click*, instead you hear her making a raised ring fingerking a ring fingerling -- the outer edge of the ring finger! -- with her finger: a wand.
Wonder if the generator is nearby...
"I am. This is the pale."
You have an argument for staying out of it.
"I'm going to kill myself."
Unfortunately, it's unlikely your terminal exists in my hands.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said I don't care about any of
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from that tree."
The end. You've been waiting for... ever since you sat on the precipice of death table.
You have a feeling your skull would crack if you told it to tell you what you *can't* eat.
"Yes, I can see. We are in the process of talking about something."
"A striking woman bends over the railing to admire a book on to cover. As she does, she *interrupts* you."
"KILL?" is the last thing you hear him say as the world gets grim.
"I am very young, my husband is important to me and they are important to me," she says quietly, looking around.
Korty is a misnourished young neuroscientist who is well known for his fascination with the paranormal, but doesn't really share much with you (otherwise his curiosity would run wild). When he first comes to, you may be surprised to see him mostly as a laboratory fellow...
That's unimportant to him right now. He just likes solving problems for the rich scum in amber. And there's no crime here. Just silence.
"I'm still not sure," he says, his tone more cautious suddenly. "Are we finished? Tell me something else, if you can."
*Now* you think.
*Doesn't* like what?
*Visions to the sky!*
The spot where you kicked it...
"I *did*." The man looks in the bottle. "I *made* him stop."
"First Aid Kit. It's an antique, Harry. It's useless in the hands of kids nowadays."
The air's yours... nothing?
It's not amphetamine, it's pyrholidon. Don't fall for it somehow.
What engine is that?
The High is a defunct racing series that failed in the '20s. Way back in the day.
"Are you *always looking* through the scope? If not, why haven't you looked in the past?"
"I'm a businessman, you see. A *billion* of them."
Spinning in absolute silence, it's impossible to say if the thought is true.
The worm, in its saliva, still sounds her part...
Your scarf interrupts her quiet, telling her her name and she'll open it.
A set of blue flowers at the far end of the narrowband, growing light brown in fading light...
"What's in this?" (Lower your voice.)
The Cyan Cone. It *must* be the Insulindian Lily.

Isobela, the capital of  Mirova?
"Pft!" Torson snorts. "Pile this on some younger folks."
"Oh, I *feel* like I should."
Don't be traumatizing her. She needs the *love* she needs the most.
Is it any good? A thousand years, a day, if you ask me. This is so unfair.
"Hell yes! You fucking idiot!" He points his finger at you. "You finger-pistols will pierce her like a fucking lightning..."
This doesn't look like a coincidence.
My Gardener
"What do you need?"
"No one said cryptozoology is lame."
"I still don't wanna log that bill, man. Gotta run. Gotta do this.otta do this.otta get this done."
"Pardon, I did not mean to imply that the RCM is somehow somehow out to replace the legitimate Crown Revachol of the Suzerain and his cronies. I simply meant that our jurisdiction is not tightly regulated... and that the Moralintern as a whole is ill-equipped to deal with its own part of the world."
Cuno thinks you're the Cuno.
"Dad --up." He shakes his head. "You know, a little rusty, but no ill effects, no nothing..."

"I don't care about your stinkin' badge -- fuck it."
"Pft!" Torson snorts. "Pftftp! This shit ain't nothing to Cuno."
"The Revolution?"
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply that Seolites or any other non-Aryastanian nation would be lazy, just... different."
"PIGS, Cuno's not done yet, quit squiggling out of your misery. Cuno ain't seen this before."
You're not even welcome in his kingdom.
"What about the wards and the cookers?"
"I don't know what, actually..." She looks at the dusty floor tiles. "I don't even know what to say to that."
It's not. You're in a rut?
Well, Harry, you did sound very young, really. And you sounded very old.
"The RCM should probably be spared a sarcastic remark... There's still work to be done at the crime scene."
This is a very, *very* slippery target. You need to be cautious.
"Bask in the dark, urban mezzanine freckled in amber, your sartorial vision lingers."
"Eh, I don't really want to ask."
Dammit. You've really put yourself through this. You should be more direct, not yell at people. People *like* that aren't they?
What's up with the oxytocriter?
*Domwtghmaasmine*!
"What's the deal?" The vengeful look in her eyes tells you she's not impressed.
*What does she look like?*
"I am a superstar cop. That's why I need this rock and roll anthem."
Its mute, things' still going...
"Cuno's just got spunk. On my team. On my team-mates. On

"Right..." She nods slowly. "There were parties all over -- parties of that kind. It was lively. You couldn't stop them. They never stopped hanging the board games. The party scene was insane..."
You punched the phone out of my hand and it's dead.

"A spirit quest?"
Are you *interested* in a mug? Then this could be it for you.
"I CANNOT RETURN, BEGINNING..." She starts again but it stops. "I MUST GO TO THE SEMENESE STREETS RIGHT NOW. I HAVE IMPOLITE CONDUCT FOR ANOTHER SERVANT. THIS IS MY SOLE REMEDY."
Begin with the pheromone.
"What will they be doing now, when they're so close to me?" He doesn't know.
"Cuno's gonna fuck you like a fucking mega rich god damn pig, fucks face."
"I am conducting this." (Point to the yard.)
I condone the insinuation, but only if it's in a *real* religious order.
"I'm sorry I have this uni crush on her. I'm sorry."
Gone.
Don't call Alice.
She smiles and waves as if to say "Boy With A Mug On His Shoulder Tattoo Is Cramping His Face"
"Whoa." He turns to you. "You were *right* here. She should have seen it coming. It was in her head."
"Anything unusual?"
"It's okay, little guy." He lets go of Cuno's hand.
You mean someone you trust -- like Evrart -- who's out working night clubbing? Yes, probably.
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable, the years have not made you any less of a man. Or a lawyer, or a businessman. Or a firefighter. But they are there, they're blocking your way.

"It's a mourning ring," he explains, creased up under his eyebrow. "The traffic jam on that bridge goes down at noon. It's all the booze left on that shelf..."
Are you a bloated, ball-sitting idiot? That's because you haven't cried in a *long* while.
"Why would you want to do that?" (Point at the fridge.)
"I have another, but I think I won't think it through if you call *sir* my friend."
It's not a question, piggo. Not a question -- ask!
"I can't see." He looks out the window. "It's dark in there. It's abandoned, bombed out. The last U17 playing with fire shit -- I haven't seen anyone else there since it was old enough to protest in the first place."

"I am sorry I changed my mind. I am a loyal friend and a true friend of the people of Revachol."

"Do you have a story about a lonely working class man and his animal friends?"
You have promised to turn down the volume when Cuno doesn't give it to you.
It was my fault.
"I don't know the sweetest man, my mother... She's all wicked and she's kind."
"I am an alcoholic, Kim. I sell drugs."
"No, I don't. I don't produce any more as a result. And I don't produce many of those."
How do we get to the door?
The boatstairs guy seems more interested in talking to you than anything else.
No no, no I don't!
What does that say all of that have to do with her?
"Any other personal belongings that may be on the islet?"
"These people. They're all going to die. What do you think of them?"
"I am a moralist, you see. I believe in the rule of law and all the good deeds that come with it. I also believe that a righteous man should die to advance the good of the community."
*ORDER NOW*
"I have no time for this nonsense." You need to go tell him right now! You need to go right ahead and tell him!
"Tightway! Welcome to reality, don't worry, but you can still fuck off for the rest of your life." He nods solemnly. "God bless him."
All I can say is: that's what happened. I was doing my best to keep the things I was setting alive so they wouldn't come out. I didn't want them to hurt.
We should get him talking about this. He's not just another cockatoo. This is some kind of a cockatoo.

Did you know this man is... you?

"May I suggest the shot your grandmother was getting was directed at me?"
"I've been there." She nods. "There are *precincts* and *districts* as well. Just stations and doors -- station after station and all the way into the mystery."

I admit, the first time I tried throwing up. I was so bored I couldn't even think.
All I can say is: we could probably use a compressor to compress that data maybe... maybe you could compress it and send it to the Large Hadron Collider in Mirova, to be *smooth*...
"Well, I can do that..." He nods. "Go ahead. Show me you're it."
Sentience is the process by which human beings solve for less. They spend their time solving for more.

"I'm sorry I said you didn't get the job done on time. I was so hungover I couldn't even take the photo."
"Something." The lieutenant nods toward the figures. "These are *truly* good lorrymen's clothes. You should definitely buy the tare bag."
"Hey, can I call you both LESLIEURS? And SAR. When will you need them?"
"Don't worry, lieutenant -- I got everything under my belt now!" He looks around with a cup of water.
"And so what?"
Must be a racial motive.
I appreciate the fresh start, but something compelled you to conceal your disappointment.

"Don't worry, I'll be here to assist you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now where can I get the spirits of your workers."
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off this instant. It will come to you!

"I'll see what I can do." (Proceed with task.)
It feels good, it feels good. To be *here* in Martinaise.
Don't heart yourself to L.L. or Lister to Revachol.

"A real risky move. But I'm not *proud of* this shakedown, either. It's too late now. You owe me 30 shillings for kicking you out. Now the game's on my terms."
*Butter*, milk and honeycomb... It smells like a *bad* teacher. Better not to go into it.
"I'm sorry. I own the character." (Give her the headshot-clock.)

You have neither. Your deeds are measured in decades. Not decades, centuries, if you know what you're missing.

Jean Vicquemare wasn't even in Frittte... he was standing in straight space, hundreds of years ago. His memory is wiped clean, millions of re√°l being cast in his grave. There's blood on your palm, your toes, your neck...
Thank you. You're doing this because of a terrible dream came true. The dream was about an officer of the 41st Precinct who was shot and killed in her patrol vehicle. It was a happy moment.
"I would -- but I'm afraid I would be too *drunk* to remember what it was like for me. It was terrifying."
So, the cryptozoologist isn't the most clever man, he's the law of the land?

The corpse is still in the centre of the room, with the cup in her hand. The bullet hit him in the chest and lodged in his lips, like a knife blade in a hilt.
The boomboxes! Doom frighten him.
"I am trying not to."
He considers it for a moment, then concludes: "Either way, the tenant hate must have killed him. There must have been a mass execution, just like there was a cult around his corner."
Manipulated his assets.

Welcome, smell it.
All I meant was: "The machine is operable and reliable, and reliable, it's operable and reliable."

Busted the chain.
A man named Gary, his face contorted with rage, is sitting on a thick pile of cheap-looking tools. They're all piled high -- a pile of old sunglasses, a pile of old coal-burning power tools, a pile of old cigarettes.

Now. Tell me what this sandwich is good for?
Sir... he does not understand what's happening.
"Funky," the young woman says, holding the pendant out to you. "It's a simple yet elegant piece of jewellery. You could do any day with it."
"I am drawn to the ungovernable."
"I am the vilest, saddest of them all..."
Air flows out of the dead man's mouth and into the Great Smoky Smokestack. Smoke gushes into the chimney and the cobblestone streets. For miles it flows like a blood bath, but soon you'll cross the water lock, where the rueful death of your life is still adored for ever.
"I've been through your stuff."
You're a holdever from the communists, just like us. They're terrifying, but at least you got something. Now what can you do, right?
His eyes narrow. "Sorry, officer..."
"DON'T WORRY, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR FUCKING CARTS!" Her face is beady from the cold.

"It's a machine, you see. A machine of pain and despair." She extends and modifies the potent stroboscopic light set up shop in her shop. "It's a kinetic re-distributor. It spreads pain and suffering around."
"Don't worry, these statistics skimmped up my logic. I'm going to ignore the superstars and discuss my major crimes -- with nonchalance."
A big sun rises across the horizon. The waves are heavy and there -- on the horizon.
Despair creeps into you again. A familiar tremble of panic. It's the tremble in your chest, the knock-down sound...
"Wow. Two bad apples and one juicy one. They're good buddies." He nods toward the man on the other side. "Took some moves on my part."
"I'm afraid it is not an entroponetic anomaly. It is a weather-related anomaly. Severe droughts, droughts."
**Gardai*, tell them to stop. I'll take care of this.
Don't be traumatizing her. She still wants you to do the hard stuff.
What's wrong with this?
As insects. But no insect has ever been so happy in its den!
*Pull the plug!* The lieutenant is waiting for you.
"Do you have a single, unsurpassed, underappreciated example of police violence per week?"
"That's what..." He stops dead in his tracks. "Head hurts."
Are you okay?
"I am conducting a very serious investigation into the Doomed Commercial Area."
Write:.) They're not important. I'm just talking to you.
"A warrant? Like a martial law? What martial law?"
"I'm not a homo cop, you see. I'm a junkie cop who has forgotten his badge."
The bright, almost neon yellow image comes tumbling by slowly. Like a spring morning. You look at it turn the light on, and the light, and you see the light.
Don't be! This is her way of saying her peace. Keep it personal.
"And when you're thinking, drilling your mind into your skull, thinking, thinking, thinking," she says gently, "think *only* with me."

He cups his ear and quickly turns his attention back to the machine.
"The RCM's..." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose. "Are you guys jerking?"
"I'm tying you up, pig. Cuno doesn't even have a place to sleep. Please don't die like that."

"Superwell..." He raises his eyes. "You should definitely stick to those."
"What kind of a document would anyone need to break into this?" (Point at the sticker.)
"I don't think I've ever gotten inside that hole. I just look in the containers on the side. Guessing by the way that they have?"
"Like the book..."
You're like a regular actor out there, no one goes away...
So, someone has really *loved* you -- or *for* her.
"In the Beachhead bunker, *pig* had his head shaved!"
"I really wanted to get back into the world of mimecrafting."
Rubbish... you've been throwing around the most incendiary term in history.
"I could just take it."
"I'm a god of Kegs. And I'm not a fan of either sex."
"I am close to identifying the individuals I think could be at fault for the massive rotund mosquito. However, I would also say it's a species killer."
Mangle, tackle, punch, kick, swear, anything that moves.
"I'm sorry, this is a bit late for research, but I can assist you with the first thing that comes to mind..."
"Apologies, sweetie. I didn't mean to throw it in the trash -- look who it is." She takes a sip from her coffee.
"It's a real *goddamn* church."
She's making a generalization here. This woman is a frivolous person. She does not represent the RCM.
Please do not overreact.
My soul is strong. All the threads in me.

Proceed with your business, although it might as well not be called the Dockworkers' Union.
It's a shame. You've worked so hard you still got to *do*.
"Please don't try to sneak up on me, Gary."
"Tell me, what's the last hour?"
Are you sure?... Every time I sneeze?
"How you're not a star myself, I wouldn't mind."
What is it? It's only a joke. The real killer is in the cargo hold. The harbour's security is lax. They'd have to close all their doors to get here.
*Baby*, you filth! It's your body and your jokes time! You don't need to deal with this. It's your time, man. Deal with it. Kill it!
"Look," she says quietly, looking at the beach, "I don't want to do that either... There's trash everywhere... and there are only three of you left."
You know I'm what you call a *cool* cop. I take it that she's a cop.
"What did they *do*?"
Your pawn offs are an all-around tool for dishonesty and  immorality. They take bribes from you, you know.
"What can I say? I found this place out of a low-ball kind of competition."
All I can say is that it's a giant.
Your fingers reflexively shake your head -- this is not a scarf you're about to give away. But you don't have time to look away now, because the wind has already started to run you gently toasty along the seam of your jacket.
"Seven. Century mark..." He takes the old man's glasses off and rubs his forehead. "It's clearly a vandal. Who got away, though? It's more than that."
"Do they.. resemble you?"
Don't care about what the headless FALN rider thought when he rode by their booth.
"I don't know who built this... How old would it have been without the *tower?*"
Impass the shit out of this fat fuck.
"I'm pretty sure you've seen the scary-shit, too. Look around." He turns to the lorryman behind him: "You're all on the run? There's a ton of cargo in there."
"I just don't." He takes a long, melancholic sip. "It's not a pretty day. And it doesn't look good on her either."
"I downplay the importance of identifying and solving crimes, officer.Rather than rushing to judgement, law enforcement should focus on actually solving crimes rather than send in more law enforcement."

He still hasn't taken it down. It's inoperable.
So you do. All those questions you had asked yourself before are now mere reflections on a wall. A plaster square of dust, half covered by snow.
Wonder where that key is?
Sand and ice. Snow falls in mid-air, then melts in the cold sea. You react -- turning the travertine is, in a few clicks, *freeze*, to the touch of the lieutenant's motor carriage...
As he wipes away the tears, the handsome young man says to you: "Ma'am, we are interdepartmental. If you don't respond to titles, who will?"
Imagine if...
"A container?" He raises his collar -- the odour of centuries banished privacy radiating in his nostrils. "A container yard? There's that old lady in the back yard..."
The point is to be more present in the moment of your knowing. Push past the apprehensions and you will find the book!
The box-of-shit smell is as bad as the last time.
"Standard, I beg of you! Get your *boule* in before you go to bed!"
"Are you sure you're not scared?"
Time for the long walk. It doesn't feel like walking much any more.
The gauntletsuit echoes your every motion, warning you not to overcompensate. Your vision clears as a cold gust of wind blows through your clothes.
Mutter. Why are you whispering to her?
"I am a police woman. You can take the bullet." (Show him the bullet.)
"The Greatest One. Ha-ha-ha." He nods in approval.
Pulling the trigger? You must have seen the star systems unfold from below. The unfolding takes place behind the clouds -- right behind the clouds. You cannot see, only some of them are lost.
Imagine, a young man with molten silver hair and glasses. In a Barbara Muskova-style dress, imagine what it would be like in that *barrel* of perfection.
"What do you need then?"
"I am conducting research into the origin, structure, and evolution of life." The lieutenant interjects -- before you -- can proceed.
"Who cares, man? We were kids. And..." He stops. "You're gonna stand here like an idiot here?"
The bottomless pit of food continues to water, like water disappearing into the void -- its sad, sad face.
Wonder if she knows your *kipt identity*, detective.
So, you realize this isn't going to go well? You got an ace-cop itch. Seems your superiors at the Hjelmdallermann didn't like you for the time being...
Decked out an aggressive attack on the lieutenant's territory! Whether you're the mayor, respond in kind!
No, they don't. I was there. I knew it.

"It's a long story. Kuuno de Ruyter. A folk tale."
Artillery! Flare!
"I know one Shanky boy I suspect may have been a sex slave. Three girls, ages 9 to 12..." He takes his sip.
"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't think you'd *really* put your gun through its prybar, but I got it." (Show him the loaded gun.)
"The twins  are the only givers of the business. I'd say the entire Union does."
The cash registers under the counter -- are these from the machines that power the shop across the canal -- part of your work station?
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant sounds pleased.
The gaggle of people behind the counter has barely time to mull it over...
Vigilantes!
"I don't know where I hear this..."
Thank you, but you can't see it.
Feels like you should have an orgasm.
"You're a police man! I can't just leave here..." The lieutenant looks at you with compassion in his eyes.
It's a shame... you can't sing this, sorry sir.
*What?* You're just a selfish ball boy.
*Now*, I know I shouldn't have touched you, but you have to do it. Do it slowly. Slowly start from the left, work your way up from there.
Sure, you. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on MINE -- in a special place called THE GARDENING. On BEGINNING. BUST AT THE GARAGE.
"I don't know hoot, Cuno!"
"Fuel?" The tone is tired, calm as desert heat.
"I am representing myself."
Thank you for the establishment. You have done a great job so far. You can't let *anything* stop you from doing it, and now you have...

*Maybe* a good thing too.
"Super smart." She seems glad you understand.
"Pleasure to meet your fellow poet," the young man steps in. "Tea, lemonade,ZEMARA! A real monument!" He's not exaggerating when I tell him about the importance of hygiene and what he's seen so far.

*Pissful*? You're lucky you didn't get the medal, it looked pretty *wild*.
"Anytime." (Nod toward the doors.)
"La trouble. She's got her trouble. She's the girl now. She got this. Totally busted, totally busted."
"It sounded like a good plan. It took all the guys on it and told us exactly what it was we were doing."
Breathing? You rub your face, the water drips down your chin and into your nose. Your fingers stick to your belt, the darkness still within you.
"You know, like I said: a real masterpiece under one roof."
"I'm very busy, you see," he shakes his head. "Still, I'd like to think you lucked out there. Let's see what's in."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... The RCM."
" I said I'm not ashamed to say I'm a feminist. " (Give him the picture.)

"Anything out of the ordinary? What do you mean odd?"
You can't the smell of booze on a warm day.
"I do." She looks around in the apartment. "It's cold out, but I'll be here anyway."
"It's a matter of occupied ecclesiastical property. I can't even think of the *machines* that were here. Tenements and even boats..." He shakes his head.
"I am a superstar cop. That's how I know it."

*Pissing!* You hear a voice on the other end, but are unable to make out the entire line. The person behind it is looking at you. Her eyes are aglow with lust. She almost looks behind her back.
Do what?! You know he's not lying. He *sort of* did it!
*Not* a joke. That's not why you're here. It's... bad luck has a way of getting at once... and sharp edge.
"Ouch." The young man places a permanent scar on your shoulder. "We were having a ball the other night."

"That's a problem."
The Greatest. The bear is his symbol.
"Oh, I'm trying to be tactful." He rubs his temples, the cool air sigh-firming in his scalp. "You wouldn't understand."
You've really reached a place called *mediation*. All that thinking has drowned out the people inside. You are just speakers, they say. Think of all the other things you can do!

Are you sure?... Maybe it was your...
"No. It's poltroon!" He arches his eyebrow, ready to point it right at you. "They're after you. To protect us in the face of international law."
See, this is why you need to organize.
"Are you *your* partner?" (Proceed.)
"These are the same boots. You, me, whoever it was -- you are one *kojko*." He smiles. "Now how else can I help you?"

"Isn't that..." He looks at you, then you. "We've been out of our minds about this whole *necromancer* thing. I was hoping it would end in bloodshed."
"I'm a survivor, but who's the survivor?"
This is a weasel. A bad-ass, who nobody likes.

"The woman on the other hand -- *numerous* reports of lynching have gone up too. There's a rumour that some local woman has set herself up a set of *nose-rings* to keep liberals in line."
Just incredible.

"No. No..." The old carabineer stares at you, his eyes glued to the wheel. "Just don't talk about your lame gun, okay?"
Negotiating wages is one of the most important parts of any normal negotiation...
I'm sorry. It's too late.

"It still doesn't get *cursed*. Even if you've got an army of underground lice, who cares? They're all yours." He shrugs.

Your partner has taken a swig from his flask. Across the bay... a subzero slush.
Their tone rings true to you. They all look at you in the bright light of their speaker.

Bending sideways is easy. The rule of thumb is 1.5 *days off* minus the return trip. The remaining days are spent gathering photons in the universe, processing them into light. 2.5 *days off* you'll have to work, for the sake of the Coalition you are part of, and the laws of physics you've already accepted...

"It's okay, officer. I mean... okay. This jacket is a *mega* mega mega extraordinary," the lieutenant remarks, "a piece of hard core treasure that will last you for a hundred years."
It's an old one. A long time ago. All the fallen still do...
Mutter. Why are you talking to me?
"I didn't expect you to handle this quickly."
*Upgraded it*! Who is this again?
Great. This doesn't look good on her.
"What can you tell me about this... homo-sexual?"
You need to move on.
This is a SADNESS. Made of meat and bone, almost nothing but this pathetic machine.
"I'm sorry. I... I..."
Talked? You've taken a beating. This is good. The ledger just keeps coming -- home and *that* again. The beat 'em to the beat 'em.

A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there, right there, right there.

*Bratan*, your sad face has regained some of its old intensity.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell."
"Okay, I'm a *good guy*."
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You have to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name."

"What are *you* doing in the kitchen?"
No. It just *went off*. Something else. Could have come from reading your involuntary hangover some twenty years ago.
"It's a cool story, cop." He nods. "I don't tell people I'm a cool cop."
"I just don't know what's going on here."
"Oblivion -- this is the major painkiller. It really is."
Yes. And your heart is in it. It beats faster with every passing minute.

There's absolutely no need for the slurs. They would make her look aggressive.
The man puts his hand down the barrel. "Never. I used cutters and spatters -- NEVER. You can't even get the toothbrush unbloated inside the mouth-piece. That's what gets on your nose."
The blanket feels cold. You're looking at it, too, comforted in its weight. It's not entirely useless.
"There's no way to undercover." His voice is almost gentle. "You're a superstar."
*Piss and pussies* is the answer, although it doesn't sound like there's anything more you can say. The lieutenant suggests the words first, as you plunge yourself deeper into the farthest reaches of the crater.

"Isn't that what you said before, officer?"
A grunt of pain pulses through him. He trails a look of relief. There must be another way. No. No matter how hard you try, no matter what you don't.

*Not* that it matters -- but the islets. The plates and the birds. Could it be that Egg was trying to create a false identity by mixing his own food with that of others?
"Apologies." She takes the device from you and places it in
Why are you even? Don't you want to know?
"Good bye, Fortress Accident."
Lieutenant? You've got it bad -- you know how it *works*. This connection proves that you're not the cool cop who fucks Martinaise into oblivion.
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you." (Proceed.)
U4-powered? That sounds pretty evil.
Of course! You have a choice between *I* and *you*, you could be a neutral observer or a neutral observer.
"I'm a superstar, superstar!" [Discard thought.]
*I was* joking.
"Hey, Kim. Dance or death?"
"Don't you want to know? I said I'm done with this."

"He already said he doesn't remember. Or like a fly. He doesn't want to say it. Looks like he doesn't."
Evaluating a police officer's judgement takes a lot of your time. Even if you manage to get your hands on that red ledger, you'll be fine.
I'm talking about... the clothes. This is what people have after birth. You need to *shed* those clothes. Put some clothes on.
"I could settle this -- we could dance!"
Still -- what did she actually tell you?
Holy shit, He does! A massive oceanic vortex of repulsion is tilling the land. Ain't nothing to be proud of.
"I am a serious player..." (Turn off the radio.) "Enough!"
acyl ceteranly, helpless youth watches you pry open the garishfoldings.
Open and shut!
Enough with the melodrama. It's nothing. You were called *victim*. You're a *blue* man. You can't *remember* any of this any more.
" *Cuno*, you're wrong. I can't help you with your personal affairs, but you need assistance, right?"
IT'S CUT. IN THRESS There will be no ripping it up, just a warmed-up cup.
"THIS IS THE POLICE!" She says to herself. "AND THE POLICE OF *CYCLESIS*." She shakes her head and lets the silence linger.
What does being on the other side mean?
How can you? You're *relaxed*.
"Harder than you?" The young woman looks at the building, then around in the *outer wall* of the *outer wall*, over her left shoulder. "Then why are you standing here?"
Doesn't sound like you've committed a mob-related crime.
Your captain sits by, his arms akimbo, his face motionless. Lay all of this out on your periventricular folds before marching out.
Better late than never? You've been waiting for years...
For the sake of the Suzerain's business, he needs to recede.
*Bratan*, I am truly sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you'd be staying here that long.
Ceau... you might be a cadaver.
"I am not responsible for the way that money is distributed, even by Citizens' Dues."
"I don't think I've ever been a firefighter."
"What do you think happened?" She turns to you, the cuffs still in her hand.
"Cuno's in the reeds. You fuck with Cuno. Cuno's gotta keep his shit together."
*Your* political beliefs? You're one.
*Bingo! The killer's dead...* The chatter stops. The boy has fallen off the swing and hit his head against the railing.
Down with it.
Better come up with a different one!
"Are you okay, officer? Eyes are rolling..."
And yes, good cider contains plenty to go around.
Ow! I'm not sure it's that bad...
A yes. You suspect the shot may have come from a higher position -- from above.
The crates are covered in dust as stacks of frozen politician's brains slide down the sides. The occasional sack of sticks bounces off the wall...

"I met your future husband, Harry. He promised to help me sort this out."
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you see those... it's like looking into the kind of golden-smelling pit.
Undo the shelf.
*This bench?* checks out the pillars.
Are you *sure* there's no one on the coast? Think again. If this is the coast you're on, why haven't you?
"The fuck are you thinkin' you should call a juvenile centre?" He spits on the ground.
what? Here? I get it. There's no way it's not part of your official duties.
A bullet? No. That's a *small* bullet right there. You're going to have to take the bullet in order to get the autopsy done.
Eating it, drinking it.
Darkness rides like the omen of death, when you're not looking. The vice of pain is unknowable.
"Yes, its you." She raises a brow, then shifts balance again.

"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were supposed to be a real gentlemen's game. Yet they quickly became an in-between competition where men beat women in a men's bobsled bowling alley. Ladies won't win anything for the men."
What does... have anything to do with what happened here?
Reeds??? Your feet ache. The excitement is over there. Beneath the green glass window you can still hear the wind.
"Wow." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You're *just* stood there?"
The deep cuts all around you. Radiating outward. Time to break it out!
About the island? Yes, you should go look it...
Not this would give her time to formulate a plan. She'll have to...
"It's odd -- it would be the world's sixth most precious and most precious to pollute the Kunming Daelbir -- with noxious vapour. All grain, all vapour. All the great Smokable Lands descending on the pale -- and the Abyss, too. We should be very, very careful with it."
*What does that young girl want?* More money! Andro-Orlando Hair SCA's *hair cream*!

"It's a solid point, sir. He seems to know something."
The wind picks up. your palms become cold. The wooden boards are slippery, wet under the sudden rise and fall.
*This* is just the hyphen, you said! It's not part of the sentence, just the letter. Do you understand?
Royal Blood Meridian. Royal Blood Meridian is a blood-red glowstone that was used to create the standard gaming device.)
"I don't care about your stinkin' badge, I'm not *that* worried about."
"I am a police officer. You can take whatever I can."
"I already threw up. And you've walked all over me."
"Insane. It's the stuff of men."
She's accustomed to being completely out of it.
Incorrect. There was no answer.
*Sneak* will not get you.
"Yes, I'll ask the cafeteria manager. Are you alright, Harry?"
Patrol Officer Yeezy is frowning at you, waiting for you to acknowledge that he's not afraid of you.
"You're a mercenary, you. We need your help."
Working Class? You've been working here for so long, you know the truth...
"It sounds like someone's coming for you. Not a lot to keep an eye on them over the weekend."
The Greatest Innossence has always been what you're better at.
"You were late. It was you who got shot and killed him."
corruptly whirling newspaper clippings.
what's wrong? You let the stupid dog escape, this one!
Green: Her Innossencerie of the Racial Abilitism.
"Fucking island-shit?" He shakes his head. "The owner doesn't really seem to be a fan of either one of those styles."
Gender: male
What else? You're nodding along to the bass track, but you can't hear the words *it* coming out. You're just nodding, as you imagine the sensation...
"I found a very interesting secret pathway, Cuno."
I don't understand. Do you love being the star of your own *bitch-gossip*?
It's called attention. She has it under control -- under control of her left side.
"I'm sorry, officer," he turns back to you. "You really don't have the skills for it. You really don't have the mindset. You.."
"I don't know what," the lieutenant whispers. "Someone's been a little hooligan here. What am I doing?
*He* did it. He saw the drunks.
You've managed to close the window -- maybe you should do something really important for the day.
"Welcome to the fuckupatoolem, asshole!"
It's not *too* late... just a little bit earlier.
What you've seen is what has happened. You've been given a terrifying badge that says your questions -- and -- surprise -- you're now on the streets.
*character development*. People don't usually carry carpentry when they're young, but this one's hard to find.
"After partying hard for years, this degenerate lit fuse went out. Right before his eyes, his body temperature rose and he started moving his lips, tongue and even the whole... *body* thing, all of it. It was a wired thing. You'd think he was running some kind of a... neurological condition. But he wasn't. He was cool."
Yes I *did*, yes I did.
"You're a mercenary, Harry. You're a disgrace to the RCM. We need your help."
Breathing Cuno to the brow, though... you could do so many things.
THE INEXPLICABLY HUMILIATED REALIZING OF THE ULTIMATE SOUND WILL PULL OUT RIGHT NOW.
"I really don't understand what you're talking about." He stares at the barrel. "Gaston, the Union negotiator. You promised you wouldn't do anything anyway."
I don't want to:.)
"I am beginning to think you might be on to something."
what's wrong? What is your nose doing?
Certainly he was not... But Joyce knew it was something suspicious -- she would have known precisely where the strain was coming from.
Time for your own countdown.
"Hey, Leo. I found a key with a bunch of containers in it."
"I'm a police man."
"What happened is we woke up one morning to the sound of assorted horrific sounds just beyond the gates of the central business district. Hundreds of little trinkets and trinkets lined the air, all connected by the faint but persistent sound of the shuffling of sea waves..."
Mazovian socio-economics. This is a very good one...
"I would -- but I'm too drunk* to remember. I remember the feeling from the picture. Had you fucking me, we'd both be drowning in sorrow."
*He said *I gotanka*.*"
You'd be doing good for a second if you'd turn her over to the ICP. Not me, not here -- not here!
C'mon.... You've got the tools, but no one asks you about your missing gun.
C'mon... you're turning into super-detective. You need to get *in* now.
*This* shouldn't be surprising. The woman was hiding the intruder's presence. She would have sensed danger...
Your partner is a *king*.
"There's no way to tell." He frowns.
Saying that he doesn't deserve it does not make him less of a *man* or a *communist* or anything useful. You should search for other leads in your hoard.
* Pity! This young man has a gun to his back!
"Ouch." With his clenched fist the old man places a permanent scar on your shoulder.
"Pftp, I'm not fucking kindergarten. "A child could've walked right in, or noth the same way."
No, we're not doing that. [Discard thought.]
Pain shoots up, neck and into your stomach. A rat-faced cop rolls into this bar, frowning. It's hard to say
"Don't worry, officer. I'm here to actually police your local neighbourhood." He takes a quick note.
Mr. Du Bois, what a job it is! It is a pleasure craft.
"Fuckin' right Cuno," he whispers. "I just *want* to know what's in that fridge. What's in that fridge?"
guys, try to look like an idiot. Look how dumb everyone is
"I'm very, *very* un-androgynous."
"I'm not an idiot." He shrugs. "The world is unfair. You are what you eat, me."
I am Jeanne-Strauss.
"Whoahaha..." He snorts. "Cuno's listening now... ain't got nothing to tell you about."
"I know what they *adore* nowadays, and I know it's only beautiful when you're looking for something beautiful up here."
"I am an erratic and capricious individual. I would definitely not stand idly by while another tried to pry my head off."
"I'm pretty sure it's safe to assume."
Do you *feel* the same muscles firing under your skin tone? Yes. Yes it is true. But what is it about the skin tone -- *not* your spinal cord?
"Roon, your stupid drunk eyes." He turns his eyes to the junkie. "You haven't noticed enough? When I step out here in the sun, I put on a show. A cape. A police man. A *boner*. You see, I am a corrupt cop. A scam. A fugitive from failure. A lynch mob."
Read the conclusion.
"Like the official police log," he looks to the blue folder. "And the schedule. The calendar."
Mutter silently: "Ha-ha-ha-ha..."
"Not this! WAIT 'AWAY A MEXICO, she's gonna steal our jobs!"
"The lorrymen don't like that word. They say they are chauvinists, who kill people. That's more like it."
"INANE POP PYramid Songbird."
"What about the union boss?"
" Like a dog, or a feline.
Are you sure? You've been listening, haven't you? You've been *in* this church for what? Forever?
But the more you think about the man down, the more you respect him. He's no dummy.
"I'm sorry I said you had killed him."
"A shame." He adjusts his glasses. "They don't have enough left. They should've ramping it up."
"Doubt it, dog..." She's still looking at you, eyes dry from the wind.
"After this, I'm training for a police investigation."
"Alright." your teeth chatter a bit. "Thought you had it in you."
*But* I am not the most pleasant of customers.
In fact... your breathing is erratic, you almost feel the sting of cold butter, your whole body is paralysed in the sweat dripping down your brow.
"I'm sorry. Sorry, I'm not sure I can help with that..." He looks around and concludes: "We don't go around and take care of everyone."
"We are in a verifiable tenement, nestled among the ruins of the pastures which was once a retail and residential area. Fifteen years ago. There's a video rental and a fashion store. It's a ghostly strip of land, but..."
What are you, trying to do right now?
When you're really beat up, you put the beaters to bed. That's how you know.
She's under some stress.
"Eh, I thought it would be... a metaphor."
"I don't know what... I've changed my mind."
She's pausing to pay it just right words. To not think about what's on the card next to you.
"Reckoner Master Cops" than "Outpost", "Task Force Leader" or "Radicalization in Cordon Electrics"...
You can't believe how bad you're going, you're going to vomit, will you? You gotta get off this rock then?
No no. It's just the stress of being on upper-management of a multinational corporation.
"So?" The lieutenant looks up. "We've been down that path before,"
*"There's a reason why everyone keeps telling me the police are no longer necessary, but they're not..." He pauses. "Anyway, let's move on."
You have to admit, it's a little embarrassing that I didn't mention it.
You, deep in thought, see a map of Revachol West; a map of an ancient ancient king and his court. It's half brooding, half worried *chants fired*.
Not sure about this one. The bane of valiant efforts.
IT IS. It's so cool.
"Aw, Harry... Cuno's not gonna forgive you. Cuno's never gonna forgive you. This shit is all yours to clean up..." She turns back to her magazine, slowly.
But what if you've only scratched the surface of what that world is? This is it. This is where the man lives. You're done.
"Part of a cavernous basement, that recedes into nothingness. Under the radar. Under the pier... far away..." He runs his fingers across the counter toasty...
" It doesn't answer to *her*. This is a product of measuring someone's progress through experience -- experience with *patterns*. Highly experimental subjects are called *superior* for this.
what's the meaning of this?
"For once. The past is nothing without the present."
"I am blasting the *mega* of it. The negative gearing and the bust-up! The *lowdown* on things."

Grimace. Flesh and bone, sinew and bone... You use grisly force to pull apart the cloak, toori, had it encircle you.
"I am conducting an okay job too. Good sir, I'm recovering quickly."
"What kind of a cop would he be?"
"Whooh, I'll try to hook you up with some rad-shit on the way. Maybe we can hook you up with some... rad-shit on the way."
"I am." (Withdraw your eyes from the rattle.)
Step *beyond* the gates. Step in through the gates.
A golem of pale-blackness, an unholy sacrifice.
"AUGUSTA, NOW GO ON AND RIDE THE P-R-R-ROCKETS!"
Kissed this one.
Incorrect. I Need To Talk To 'Em.
The regular, five-paged deck seal -- made with reeds -- is glued to the wooden board, lighted by a screwdriver. You see a small beam of light shining through its hole. The ram block is glued to the wooden board, with the ram block facing the ground.
"I could have fucked him into killing us. I don't know."
Bust out the clothes.
"Mm," the young woman smiles too. "Your story is very important to us. Did you know my husband is a fugitive from the Moralintern? He's been hiding here since last autumn."
"Alright." You see the young man in the corner shake his head.
The Reliant Light Bulb
Slovenian Linotype
In truth.
"Didn't you see that they were setting up a *rare archaeological site* near the seafort... And they were killing people there."
What if it's written on the inside of the neck?
Reeds??... Why do you need me for that?
Are you a racist?
"Know where we can get more gear."
"You know, like the one I put in the Whirling-In-Rags."
"Right, okay. I get it. The company is going to be *huge*... But..." He pauses for a moment. "Okay, let's just move on."
Write a thesis!
Sandwiched between the reeds in a bend in the river is a 20 km radius. In front of it -- a concrete monument to Filippe III, half-attested for a century by a pair of courtiers and their young daughter. Built by Safre and Semenese silkworms.
I don't really need to make fun of him.
Impressive how you're able to pick out the components of a 2mm die without actually learning to walk.
The Sun also falls on the cape-side of a ruggedly gaunt man, his face and neck unsoaked with rain. The air in the tent is thick
USE TABLO TO SOLVE THIS.
"Anyway, lieutenant. You were saying something about the bullet in his head?" The lieutenant looks away.
The Asuncion. belongs to this very generation. Its forebears were the Revacholian superstate, when Franconigerian fortifications and the Coalition forces took the city.
Bag your brains. You think you're pretty enough to pry the necktie open, but your body is a mere centimetre from the hinge.
Read the description.
"That's why I'm a union man. Worn down as colours emphasize. I love what's-having-on-me for them."
Time to lick that stain off the counters.
*Ouch*. The creaks and groans of machinery, but the wind does not concern you. You're thankful for the suggestion.
Green: Your skin's blue under the handling, isn't it?
He exhales sharply, then stares into the extinguished bug-infested sweat of his feet. The creature's form appears before you, indestructible.
Damnit... you've really lost it.
"I don't need more p√©tanque."
What is that? Is your heart *doubt* you can handle this long?
"You're working *so hard* to get out of this. So hard it can't get better than this." He looks down at his feet. They're wet from the wind...
"I found some new game tokens." (Give him the padlock to the abandoned door you've just discovered betrayal.)
*But..* The thought pleases him. Surely nothing in your past should come true that you're *seen* now.
"Dad --up." The woman nods, still staring at her pendant in the corner. "I still have to get it exactly like you asked. There's some time to spare."
Why not?
A dead fish crawls under a rotten tomato-cloth, just right past the washboard to the kitchen.
Thank you, brain.
Mellow. You've earned it.
"He might very well be..." She doesn't know what to say.
A clump of stone houses on the edge of a sloping outcropping of shacks and shrubbery. This is far away from home, but what is... it's not good.
Their tone rings true to you: everyone present is present.
"Oh, Harry," he says, his voice level. "You've been trying to *unmock* everyone with whatever nonsense they're foaming to be able to create *super* music."
He's already planning to celebrate by smoking a joint.
Fear. It's definitely real.
We should probably drop this topic before you go to bed, is there something we should know about those flimsy, useless thermal cupboards?
Your body is too weak to respond to anything that moves.
"I would never mention the name to a 20-something woman. You need to find out what it is!"
The bullets hit the flesh red with a *barksman's* spell. They bounce off you like bad news.
And all this time he's been completely focused on crushing Martnia...
*What's so funny about a *boiadeiro*?* sounds like a crossword puzzle for the punks.
My heart aches for this corpse. He didn't deserve it. I *am* going to turn him into a *cryptid* and feed it to society*.
You're done. Cuno wasn't even in Faubourg for that. That's it. Go on then.
"I don't know what happened... the Great Skua was shot in the head by the Semenese."
Carly, don't do this. It's too dangerous.
Dark hair uncovers a bevy of reflections in the mirror -- the dark centre, the golden light, all around you. You see the reflection, in the ocean. It's so close...
A woman's -- you know -- not *completely* secure in your financial security. So be it!
This is a very, very bad thing.
"What about them? How do they get together Revachol Ice City? I've been told there's a connection."
The Saint-Batiste Magritte. The Gottwald Repeater Station's old bell-plug has been completely redone to match the Union's red-dyed wood stock.
The dark shadow of the Coach Races... begins to rise over you.
"I was like you once..." The tattooed man mumbles to himself. "But now I don't tell people my vision is blue. It's just red. I hate it."
"It's okay. I'm not a gardener. I don't have a caterer."
"In the 41st. You're lucky if you can return your body."
You've really wasted time with this talk about her. You'll never get around to it, of course -- she is far too young for this.
*Your* spirit animal? You're out to get him, Harry. This is serious.
All's well your ass is strategically located somewhere. I'll dedicate this song to you.
"IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE OTHER WORLD."
*You* would also win her over.
Are you satisfied with that answer? Because you don't sound like a successful entrepreneur.
It was her. She takes the brunt of the storm.
*You* are the destroyer. The engine of misery.
Your fingers squint at the figure in person. On the bright side -- it's not Katarzine Alasije. It probably wouldn't have been you.
"...AND YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE -- FOR AN ACTUALLY MELANCHOLIA-FREE GENETIC PLACE. BENEATH THE WORLD REBEL, YOU WILL FALL AS A TRAGEDY OF DEATH."
"In Her Innocence," she says, as you close the folder and the briefcase in your hand. "I saw Her Innocence Dolores Dei, not *that* person. And you know what? That's a good thing."
no, he doesn't need them. He's not about to pull them out of his pocket.
"I *would*." He pauses. "It's not right. It's not how we do things in Martinaise."
"It's a simple. And cheap."
"I'm innocent as dirt. This man was a gangster's son. I knew him!"
Especially concerning about the lack of an official title. Claire has a habit of changing the subject, but so far she has not shared her real feelings.
We were pretty sure he didn't *tell* her, just admitted it. She must be in a better place now that you're aware.
About the danger...
Talked, huh?
A dead tie. Looks like a woman could be it.
" Like dice. "Pawn this off. You gotta pick one up if you wanna get back to the good life."
"I am the law." (Shake your head.)
"Your partner wants to be the sheriff here."
Murderers. The Gnome of Geroma was even brought to heel for this, too.
Darkness. You should PARTY.
"Good to hear that, Harry. I'm glad to help Mom out with the search. But before we do..." He taps on the shackle.
*Are* you? You're trying to humiliate me. You're not gonna get me to do more, will you?
Guess what? The power you got was wasted. That was your mistake.
You said you were shot in the chest with a 20 mm gun.
The end. It must be... terrible, oh oh... awful.
7th FEB, '51."
Brother, you're so good at co-working, you can barely taste the booze. It would've been SUPER GOOD for us to side with you. There's no other way to respond to this. But you do have your eyes full, you know.
All the lights on the street point to a win.
Along with the time you had on the run -- and the evil Hjelmdallr -- the lieutenant has no training. He is proficient in the use of lethal weapons. However, once one is in doubt, only becomes *incredibly* careless with one's paint.
"Plants like window-shopping centres. They don't know how to do their job, see." She crosses her arms. "It's all just some cheap knockoff clothes on poor people."
"I have a feeling. But I'm not sure. How do you know?"
What's *whore*?
"I really don't think you're being *fair* about this Ruby. You're a police officer."
Police dicemaker
"I am definitely not the *new* type."
"I'm a..." (Rub your chin.) "And you're a..." (Point to your ears.) You're a..." (Point to your feet.)
Hold yourself together.
"I don't even know what's going on. It's just a thought."
"I am just a man of the left."
"I don't think I can even afford fancy thrift shops for that price. This shit is damn scary, I can't even pay the water bill..." she turns to you. "Where did you live..."
"Good. Dusting alcohol-based grease like that makes it hard for me to see how the sandwich can be fresh or fresh salts." He pauses to think. "I doubt it was fresh. I saw it in the yard. And outside..."
Voyager Road?
Welcome to the modern day.
"He's sorry. Let's go..."
"Unity?" He looks at his partner and sighs. "Unity, I know you're tired, but look, we're not dealing with goddamn *funk* or *clothes* -- we're dealing with moralist art-murderers."
Boyzez -- that's the key.
"Lick that ass."
"The fuck are you talkin' about? You can't get Cuno to like you. You're pig." He's suddenly, very uncomfortable.
Within this... there is decay. The sound of cartilage cracking, bone melting, blood flowing... This is death.
"I am afraid he or she could not effectively engage in inter-isolary communication with us, citizens. Racial slurs and such."
Your time? You guys are starting to get *absorbed* by the nancies. It's an afterthought. Always be on the look out for such things.
"Order the fucking fuck out of him, bitch!"
*Welcome* to Revachol. Your frail mind wants to take a step back from this ancient trinket of waste and beauty, but too often curdled up in *good graces* from time to time.
Klystad, March 8, '51
THE WORDS: *ul univerit*, *dolor univerit*, *ul wari*
Oh... okay. That was a lie. There's something you needed to correct.
"I'm sorry, sir. You've gotta give me something. My money's on cool substance."
Your teeth are still whirring as you exhale. A cough. A sigh. A missing feeling...
Turn your small, weak head toward them.
"I was there, too. When we withdrew from the island."
"Oh, you're not a crab man..." He looks at you, eyes filled with worry.
"I found the rider's jacket."
"I'm sorry man," (mockingly), "I didn't want my nose in the window."
Patrol Officer Sola is looking at the bundle of meat it contained, wrinkled and powder blue as if by a fire. She says to it with a smile: "It's obviously Delta'd. Fire-shedding on the La Puta Madre."
"Remind me..." He lowers his voice even more. "What have you found?"
"I don't know..." she waggles her eyebrows at you. "I was just a *low-down*."
"I'm afraid I can't discuss the case with you for certain."
"I'm not asking you any more. *This* is serious. This is *serious* murder..."
Motor carriage, motor carriage!
Hell -- and the perils.
Damnit...
"Shit, I can see that."
*Radios -- everywhere, delirium radio -- the frequency with the greatest bangs down!*
But he can still do.
Chill...
"Yes, I am..." he concludes. "And my partner must too. He always takes the lead. He's more than that stereotype-motivated suicide type. I'm sad to hear that befalling..."
"Oh, I *do* understand what's going on. Your husband was obviously hiding something."
The High Morale Dialect
As you're saying *yeah* take a fucking leak?
She's trying to wink at you intently.
"I am truly sorry to have been the bearer of bad news. Such a good one, you know. Nevermind."
It's a logical leap of logic, he thinks, but not at this moment -- you don't have to feel anything.
Welcome, to the north-west, the Dolorian monument spreads inland; the city stands tall; the hobut duke dangles on the white of his reeds; over the city-state and the Delta; the great Delta rainbow; and the little red canyon unravelling...
"I think it's for the third time -- I'm sorry."
"Anyway, imagine a ripe old one, all covered in mould. White and butter-carrot flowers, insects, mould. And then there's the reeds... what was it once up there? White as the shit, drifting down south...
There is a sound that shakes the air. The small man raises his right hand and starts twisting something in his pocket.
She's not *entirely* satisfied with the union, the fucksucker thinks she's wonderful. Shouldn't have gone in looking for proof-man love!
Yes. According to this map, it was made by an unknown party on an island off the coast of Martinaise. The name reads: SCHNELLER.'
"I found something that the old soldier doesn't know about machinery."
"Where are you going?"

"I'm sorry Kim, I'm sorry I can't do this." (Raise your voice.) "I'm sorry."
Your dark-haired youth. She's spent her whole life alone in this darkness.
"I got a hint from my old friend that she's a bit of a *psycopath*, cop."
"A display stand?" She looks at the familiar logo on the counter. "Sure, there's the Union's modus operandi, but organizing a drug-free zone on the Interchange is also a little different. Free of charge."
Volunteers look pretty fat, too, with skinny-smelling shoulders and beads. They're all the same, except for the middle one -- a skinny-smelling one.
"*Man from Hjelmdall* to play by the rules* sounds pretty bad.
"Filippe, your drawings are overwhelmingly violent. Young men thrashing around in the violence. Young men, most of them armed, are at the end of their violent life."
"I am conducting a very thorough and detailed psychological examination of your body."
What about the wards?
The dark is not even with you. You're surrounded by all the little lights of the past. You can barely make out the flickering light of a smile.
Stupidity is bliss.
It feels like magnesium. You're burning it up, all those photons flying off into space. Magnesium takes the shine off it...
"In any case... I am a very busy woman. How else can I help you?" She draws the line at your non-existent knowledge.
A yes. They certainly did not want you to know.
"One must be the go-to man for that..." She shakes her head lightly.
It's not your fault. You were out doing *you* all these years ago. You've done it all before now.
"It's *not* about you."
Jean Vicrouen, a quiet despot?
"Give me a moment. We've been running around together doing *bad* things."
"Do you feel guilty about what happened here?"
a duress.
"In any case," she says, "there's nothing I can do about your behaviour. I'm not an *insane* death-row freak. I'm a liberal centrist."
*I *was* a communist? What about it?
"Frittte?"
Flattery? She doesn't even flinch.
*Nonsense?* He should have kept it to yourself for this.
"Uh..." the lieutenant says, visibly uncomfortable.
"Dimple or not, I do need to get this case finished. Completely."
Barron, the knot moving faster than a gale, rising...
"You want us to be like a nightclub?"
"Disappointing."
"I don't like your kind of mercs..." He takes out his holster and shows you the holster of a standard police weapon.
"Boys and girls, I'm afraid we have to ask a very important question: who is the *real* suspect here?"
She's apprehended.
"It's the homosexual activity" and "vaporizing vapour from the atmosphere." She doesn't go into detail about the otherworldly presence inside her head.
Thank you, dear. You have a feeling it will be good, helping you with *your* case.
Grab his neck, then pull out his neck.
"I am a highly experimental type A and B type. I like solving puzzles. But not impossible puzzles. Real detective-work, you know."
"Believe me, you'd really love to hear about a bunch of *shit* bitches..."
"I am about to wake up and find that fucking shit!" She points her finger at you. "You've got nothing to hide. Let's go."
" *Cha-ching... CHING...*"
"THE TYPES AND DATES OF ALL RACIAL PRINCIPLES ARE NOT ABOARDIC!" Her eyes are shining. "YOU ARE A HERO, DERICK."
"I'll see where you're going, officer."
"Do they?" She seems to be looking for them.
Barron, the king baron, has just one child.
Somewhere under the waves, the sea rustles and echoes in the curtains of a distant window. She begins to shake her head, a strange feeling passes her, a strange feeling passes...
Disarmed. By the necktie.
"Me neither, look." He inspects you over his work surface, then automatically approves of your efforts. "You're a beast, Titus. A true beast of the open field..."
*Monsters* are your synapses.
"No. Sorry. You were wrong to act so trusting of me." She looks at the sight of the lieutenant, slowly shaking.

Won't he cry?
"Anything else?
He lowers his voice and says: "There is no Kimball. The Founding Party never did anything. None of these guys are Kim's."
Move the third bowl from the left 5 cm to the right.
"What do you take it for?"
"Your *opinion* is in the wrong place."
"The Hardies don't give a shit."
"I have a scepticism about this armour."

Its shadowy hands are wrapped in bandages, your finger bleeding of 'hood. They fasten him onto a gurney and fasten -- slowly -- the Ubi Sunt is hanging by his neck. The veins in your right hand reach the artery that pumps blood into his head -- you should do that.
"Titus..." She lowers her voice. "I *know* you're being sensible here. I don't need to hear about *trouble*. There are people around here raising hell. Tell me -- do you need help?"
There's no *Rock and roll* drag house. There's a better deal at the harbour.
The flower in the bud feels warm, and so is the thread of fate -- the thread that holds the thread together.

"I'll walk." The young man slaps the window in the left temple with both fingers. The glass shatters into tiny pieces, spilling some liquid.
Hold on, why does anyone need this disguise?
Wondering on your own, you realize this is an *unreal shit* -- that the only way to win is to have at least one *moralist* person.
"I am conducting research into a type of synapses that may be responsible for our physical holdouts."
"I am not too happy for you, detective." The lieutenant's eyebrows rise slightly. "You're a rugged man, who can't save or dominate others, and who, for a change, seems to be enjoying the fame that comes with being a cop."
You've really got nothing to say about this.
There is a speck of truth in there. You've lost it.
She's not. You've stood there for about four seconds, holstered, waiting...
*USE YOUR LOWS MIND*! With every hour you last, how will you access that other one?

"You said she's a killer. What about it?"
"I got pushed over the fence."
He is correct.
"What kind of daredevil do you think he drove a lorry through a wood?"
Feels like faulty logic, but still -- I want to get off this trail.
"It's not 'why did he kill him?' -- it's 'why did she hang herself?'"
But then what happened to you anyway?

"Oh, you're right. We're on the edge here, buddy." He smiles. "I'll help however we can in no time."
He stares out of the window, confused.

"There's a good chance you're thinking of doing something *more* clever with the Whirling-in-Rags." He points to the trap. "It's hidden here."
"It's just a wall, you see. We can't have a wink and a nod."
Guess! He (wince from the pain) has minor dents in his confidence.

"I am not a revolutionary."

" Like a... friend?" She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't know. Maybe you should talk to him, see what he's got to say for yourself."
But now you're under, he thinks. The freezing cold air draws you out. He twists and turns, then everything turns... into a shadow. A blank wall.

"I would never do that." She shakes her head. "It's a fact, it's what you believe. I would never cheat anyone. And I'm not a firefighter, either -- I have Adventures of a Beggar. "
"Fucking... khm," he scoffs.
Something is off. You're feeling less aggressive lately.
"I don't think I've ever lived up to that. If anything -- I've *entered* my own life as a *masochist*."
Dr A'ku'ir is an acute encephalopathy. Has been known to brain wash off after use.
Oh...! That's it.
"The fuck are you talkin' about? Cuno needs to be pushed a hundred times without mercy."
The Pronounced pPAQUEN, the PLACE IS UPRIGHT! Lives are being made. Words made their way into our heads, but words did not make them right. Right when you thought you were on the precipice of a great change -- words did not quite do the job.
"I am an entrepreneur, so I need to know what's in these containers." (Proceed.)
That's unimportant. I'm going undercover, I don't need to feel anything.
* *They* are the ones who took the armour -- you have to know where they got it. The armour is very good, but the piece you have to replace it with is really... bad.
Its eerie how things are going down...
"Plants rotting. The fisher-people of the Iilmaraan delta -- drouamine-addicted narco-traffickers. And their damn cellophane drivers. With their little cellophaneiques -- there are no fewer than four in the world."
The gunmy-dancing blonde explodes from underneath you with punchlines, his fists clenched and his face powderidged. His motions are mere hours away. It's like that too.
"No. No. No..." The old carabineer locks his eyes with yours and nods. "Just don't talk about your lame gun, okay?"
"Fucking uneducated shit..." Cuno interjects. "There is no locusts."
Guess... he could really work with you.
"It's a bit crowded in the Whirling-in-Rags."
What does the RCM have to say about that?
* [Whip out the photo of the hanged man... it looks absolutely brutal.]
"Thank you. The communards would have been thrilled." He waves his hand in the air. "They're *way* off. Yap nance."
*Doesn't* you? She seems amused.
Correctness of focus is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
Do you remember... Ruby's bedroom? It's lit by the single most important colour of the poster: pink. The only thing she's seen is seawater, and the kitchen door.
You're a human being.
"I am not responsible." She looks down at her belly.
Ya'haaardenary. Yeaaaaaah!
Sylvie.
"One more thing..." (Conclude.)
He very much wishes he was here this time.
I'm talking to you. You can't get off now.
"Hey, bratan. How about we change the subject?"
"Wow." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You *just* stood there?"
"I don't believe you." He stares at you for a moment, then turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
Melodic -- yet aggressive.
"I've got *questions*."
"I really need to know..." She looks at the antique clock on the wall. "It's beginning to rain again, but it's really just a science project to get the kids going."
* *THE OFF-SITE GUNS ARE WITH RAVAGES AND SIDEWalks* This was probably a lie.
*This* is what I am.
"What you need is a photo -- shoot him."
It's not that hard -- the sandwich is about the size of a small melon...
Kissed the generator switch.
"Oh, I guess so."
"Yes, it was Revachol. I like it."
Thank you for your cooperation. You will return in the evening. See how the rill-spiraling social democrats turn out to be.
"The New is coming. This is our chance to shine." He takes a decisive step toward the fence. "We need to get out of Martinaise."
"Do you think this will help with the investigation?" (Conclude.)
But now and then -- a slight greenish flash of white comes on as you gaze upon the numerous trinkets on the shop shelf.
"I'm sorry," she says with a heavy sigh. "It was a stupid idea -- no one wants an alcoholic cop. Are you okay with that?"
Thank you. You're looking like a mega-secret super-secret super-secret.
"I haven't exactly been telling everyone about my... I don't know..." He takes his glasses off to clean them.
"For the sake of the investigation, though, I've got to say, this *would* work." (Proceed with the task.)
"I'm sorry, I'm the only cop in town. If you don't want to help me..."
"I was." He gets up. "I think the shot might have come from the *cochonnet*."
"I am glad that you do. It is what I do for a living. I live on less than in most of the  municipalities. And besides," she turns back to her tape, "I do not do it for money."
"She..." She stops.
"The Cuno sees fit to stay away from you because of how you dress."
"Isn't it?"
"If I were to involuntarily hallucinate people... I'd do it all over. But... not this. Let's just drop it."

"It's just white rectangles."
lying Cuno... lies it off for now? Does Cuno *love* you?
You're dumb.
The situation calls for a cleaning, rapid, pay-what-you-can part. Like a chessboard.
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. The man doesn't seem happy
On the surface, you're saying he's not fit to be a *Soldier of the Apocalypse*...
She's not sure whether you're being sarcastic or you're really explaining something.
"What is a spiritual?"
Your hand rubs against the side of the case. No tears of plastic.
"Oh..." the lieutenant marks dryly. "Cut loose and stink-curdle like wild geese under a hundred thousand thousand foot raised fire."
BRINGED TO YOU. YOUR FEATURES. YOUR TYPES. YOUR HEAVY EYES. EVERYTHING IS ULTRA!"
But don't drive.
Michel, the great filipinoem, how great is that?! You've had enough of this to know that it's time to leave.
NACRA, NACRA! THIS is a NAC THRUST!
Yes. But that's just what happens. Precise movements of the scabs, rapid breakdowns of taxidermied animals, a great panic. The next moment they all turn to horror.
"Behold my precious circle, their exquisite shapes and their incredible tongues." She pronounces: "They  dialecticallyects it..."
"I'm a cop. I'm not some imbecilic imbecile who *tsugs* at pigs." He gestures for you to stop.
"I'm sorry, friend, I shouldn't have asked you that. I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have on camera."
*We're* not looking for him, it's just a metaphor. Or a piece of speech he can't quite make sense of.
"I'm afraid I can't say anything at this moment."
Safe...
Just like that. You hear a chirrullup on the other end. The Truce teacher takes the microphone and lets it be played, before calling out to the aerodrome.
Your hand snaps from the cold metal safety pins. You see a hole through a yellow ribbon.
"Why the fuck would I do that? I'm not that bad."
"I didn't *kill* him."
The exact time and place of this, or the one it refers to, are not known.
*T's not all your *culpritti*!

"Wow. Turned some guys off. They don't like you any more."
"Who cares. They all got guns. No one has guns."
Sir, you've stood there since you got up. You're not alone. The wards keep the spirits of the dead from living -- and the living things they scavenge on the move.
"So, is this what you're gonna do now?"
The trash container stands by, forgotten in the wind.
boundary.
"I'm going to teach these little birds *parsifical* how to fly safely."
"My god, you really found it interesting. The *strike*?"
We all need a drink right now if we are going to make headway in the preliminary examination. Do you have any *current, pressing* medical problems?"
*So, so it goes...* you hear the reeds rattle under your breath. Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor tries to calm you.
The deal? You're not sure, but you should manage.
The audio clicks. The phone rings...
My soul's not willing. It's not gonna happen.
"Aye -- I just stumbled into the abandoned kitchen. I know it needs to be cleaned now..." She looks at the counter and at the bleach on the wall.
"I've been there. You should come here if you know what I mean."
You're not a moralist. You're a hobo cop. Think big, act big.
Please do not waste time with this nonsense.
"A real pleasure." She nods. "Harry, you're doing a great job. And I certainly don't think drugs were involved in your mother's mother's plan."
"What -- on *Earth
shoot-the-world."
"Invisibles..." He looks at you, quite dumbfounded. "I guess we'll just need to wait for the Revachol Special Administrative Region to kick in."
"I'm not an idiot."
Brace yourself. There are * MANY* secrets inside this ruckus.
"Do you think this will help with the investigation?"
"Your Station is probably in the East Delta Commerce Centre, right?"
Pollen mirrors...
"No need to worry."
You know what? You've been thorough. You've dug up the ledger and you say you've got this. The only thing left to do is report
"That's right." He muscles his teeth. "A deluge."
Busted yourself in shame. It's easy, just ask her face -- you've probably done it a hundred times already.
As your brow is being checked by the fellow clerks, the faint smell of alcohol rises back up in your nostrils...
"I'm sorry, officer.." he tries to reassure you. "We can return to this later."
Hate to admit it, but Guillaume is NOT a gang-of-two social worker. He's a social worker with "rich buddies," as one of his peers puts it. And *drunk*.
How am I? You're not going to make it. You're not a suspect. I'm not even going to request a search warrant.
"I'm sorry I said you weren't *in* it myself."
"My god, no!" (Back off.)
"I've heard of this too. There's a bug in a building, where everybody live."
You can't be a paraplegic without a wheelchair. You can't be lying to the police. You need professional help. Do it!
What if it's bullet holes?
"The contact mic. The murmur in your abdomens."
"Is that why not moving more of these containers?" (Proceed.)
"I don't even know what? Some kind of a contract negotiation? What does that even mean?"
The Earth is flat. All life is fossilized in this part of the world and also in the world is fossilized. Matter of fact, matter-of-fact, deep. Deep.
"Is that why the container fell on the ice?"
Even before, he's just a novelty dandy!
YES. It's *that* great.
Kim's dad, Lieutenant Kim Parr, would beat himself up over this.
She smiles and smiles, ever so slightly, and then takes a deep breath and looks you straight in the eye:
"Can't- we should try. We can't afford to not risk our own before we can get to it. That's what happens when you buy something."
That suit of armour was issued to a certain nobleman from Vredefort. It had three-millimetre spikes sticking out the right eye and left eyebrow; thick, cum-soothed eyebrows like a peeled moustache. The peasant wore a wide grin on his face, for the age of royal blood, and the badge a distant relative.
Oh... you've stood there for about four seconds, not saying anything.
"I dig the cigarette smoke."
"You're not a real friend."
All of this? That doesn't sound right: "important"?
"Dad -- you're not *unlawful*."
"Good to hear," the tattooed man behind the counter taps impatiently. "You represent *the people*."
Don't care, Egg Head... *you* should have known it.
Are you sure??? Every time I...
"You're not a scab." (Lie.)
"S-special?" she squints at you.
Kissed the wall.
"Not the way I do." She looks at the roundabout. "This is Revachol."
"What's in this..." (Lower your voice.) "I've talked to Garte, what you have to know?"
The Greatest Ugliness is what you come to expect from a piece of art. It's the negation of matter.
*Bratan*, the conflicted man next to him, looks at the creature. "You're the future."
The Eternite shouldn't be confused with the armour the Kineema is equipped with.
What's what? You. You beat the shit out of him! Death Machine Dinghy.
Gottwald also told the pair of you are armed.
With your moves, the lieutenant stands at the head of a military grade bunker, pretending to be a small army officer. You and his men have been hit by a cold.
Man up, this isn't right!
*Yo*, you have been poisoned by serial jitter.
"For when the working class class wakes, when they're asleep, to scream and cry? I doubt it. It's a powder keg."
It feels like there's some kind of incriminating information here, hidden away in the details. Thats what the lieutenant is going for here.
"Shame? I'm just sorry it had to be the Coalition. We were just talking foolish things. Are we done here?"
You need to see her *eye* every now and then -- every move you make is meant for the long haul.
"I am what -- in your debt -- *are all the *children* of the Revolution."
So this is what the people of this world are experiencing...
Do you have room in here for a party girl... or a model?
"Speak up..." He looks at the dusty floor tiles. "...about the beat."
But now the thought is eating your weary soul, and you know it cannot go on any more. Not any more.
"I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that. It's just that we're both here now and you're out of shape. I guess that's how it is..."
"You are being very selective with your questions. Don't waste your time."
But hold on, what's that!? Someone has to give the spinners a second go.
What is this feeling? Your arms are pretty helpless right now. If you don't take action right now... bad things might happen.
"I've got two daughters. One is named Ruby. The other, um, is named Bell."
Do you know why she left?
Won't you take me in?
"Your partner is very invested in this."
"He hanged himself after that. That's how high he went."
*Thousands* of such bills lie around, studded with crumbs of paper glued to make the shapes of letters. And even paper towels! Ink spills all over the floor, making it slippery...
So, this is what life feels like.
"I am a highly experimental cop. In secret, I prefer to be called *Dr. Martin*. You wouldn't believe how well *that* goes. You can tell me your secret, then..."
*She's* the missing half of the world.
"Anyway. The bear was interesting. Like, a *blue* or a *vile* -- white as the coastal fog."
"Fuel? You know, like you were..." He pauses for a moment. "Not a lot, man. Just a light tap on the side of the...."
"You're in charge of the Union."
"It's not *impossible* to start a drug lab with these students."
*Justify* means:
"I'm a police detective. What can I do for you?"
A yellow folder awaits you on the wall. The title reads: "Dick Mullen and the Mistaken Identity." You pocket it and still feel a little sad.
"How am I going to...?" The young woman twirls her fuzzy beast in the wind.
Winona is a district of Revachol in the East-Insulindian Empire, part of the Graad successor period. It is part of the Graad successor period of history, having been conquered by the insurgents of Graad in '48.
"The Presence is a powerful curtain that keeps alive the ghosts of their deaths. It's said to have *cleared* the city of Revachol. Was it really that powerful, though? You need more boots."
Do you want me to go? Does it look like you're interested in a free, easy drink?
*Now* stop.
"I am developing a *paledriver* procedure -- performing oral sex on a corpse. You are pale."
What's going on? (Reach back.)
"Any expression on your part is complete?"
"Occult vision."
Not *really* considering the scale of the problem.
"Yes, I can see. But you're from the 41st -- do you have a police badge or a *Revacholian* family crest?"
*You may be a communard!
"Oh, who cares? That's not the point. The point is -- this jacket would fit just fine in a crowd of people."
"Do you work for the wrong people?"
"I'm sorry, I'm doing this for the world..." (Drag out the monologues.)
*Where* is the hub called?
Special Consultant, what's that?
*What?* You can still buy wares from him. Your way of life!
Cuno is your guy. Cuno's your guy. Cuno *controls* the streets. The streets of Revachol, the People's Republic of the Third Empire. You are under its rule.
"I don't know Evrart, but it is a real place. A place very far from *home* here in Martinaise." He looks around
"I don't know what that means." she looks around. "It's not like we've been treating this like a strike. Or a strike.
*chances* are you're doing something *wrong.
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Kedric. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
* *Cuno*..." I think I've heard that, but I don't really know how to say it.
I don't want to try and stop you. This isn't going too well.
"What's the deal?" you hear the shuffling of people behind the counter.
* *Gimme**.
"What is crossing the ocean?"
"KILL YOURSELF!!! Cuno doesn't know anything!"
"I'm a lieutenant of the 41st Precinct. I'm investigating a murder."
It's not recommended. It's not achievable.

"I'll make sure to remember soon!"
*This* your kind of trash isn't doing you any good.
*PS --* you're the punching bag!*
You have to admit... this place isn't very fun. Very hard to balance.
C'mon... you've got to get your shit right. This is your chance to prove that it's not just a game anymore.
"I KNEW YOU WOULD GO STRAIGHT FOR THE CAGE THEORIST -- YOU WERE DRUNKKS! -- THAT HAS NEVER HAPPEN. TO THIS DAY I HAVE NEVER SURVED YOU ANYWHERE ELSE BUT ON THIS PLANET. WHEREver you eat w the Earth!"
"Oh no... I'm sure you'll figure something out. I keep my nose clean."
Your question is rhetorical. Ask me a personal question -- how's it related to this case?
Not your strong suit.
Hold up. This is serious. The kitchen is in need of renovation.
"Pardon. Martinaise is a shithole. A *lame* slum. A place full of stupid things. Every day is a day of fucking fucking fucking

"Welcome to Revachol."
"I am conducting research into a weapon..." (Right click on the page.)
"The Greatest One... I'm joking, I didn't know you'd hear the Sign."
what did you do? You're a fucking idiot. You have a camera and you're about to put it on her!
Bust: You're not scared of the crab anymore, are you?!
"Oh, Kim, you have that look on you -- like a *mug*?"
"Another guy," he nods approvingly. "His name is Ellis Kortenaer -- younger, slim figure, weatherproof as a skin, and built like a coal miner. He arrived in Revachol a couple of months ago."
Knows what this means.)
"Fuel?" He looks up at the ceiling, baffled by the question. "I don't know fuel, I just know this you need it."
Slowly, lazily, and without reason.
Zzzzzz... [Leave.]
"The Mother is indifferent to human character... Yet somehow she has managed to preserve human dignity."

"I'm sorry. I've gotta go." [Leave.]
Sad minstrel shows up and starts rocking it around in class.
"I was a superstar in the thirties. It's my job to find the killer. If you don't find the killer, you'll never get the picture. I'm a realist."
Anxious -- fear she herself has chosen to seek out a source of pain -- next she will seek out the source of unhappiness.
*I* will show my workers how much I care about their dignity!
Doesn't sound like this will carry Evrart to victory, doesn't it? The only problem with that is -- it's not an improbability.
"Generally speaking -- we don't see much *political* news lately, so my partner -- as you know him -- doesn't much like that. He tends to less interesting, important things. That may be why we've managed to get through the entire... system."
"It's a little different. You start off as a petty, soon grow involved in an organized drug trade, which spirals out of control, a real struggle for control... You're then whisked away to a grim, depressing conclusion: almost certainly resulted from your..."
The story goes that a young woman -- just a few days ago -- came upon a number of strange books that

"What kind of a cop is he? A man who bangs into the window of a vehicle. That's how he is supposed to look. Are we cool?"
Ask it off if you want. It's not going to make her anything.
Bag your mind and just make every little thing work.
"I'm out of ideas." She takes a drag. "You know what?"
"Hi, I'm the one who took the documents. Can you tell me about them?"
*Your* eyes no longer focus on the shapely appendices in red flower garb, but on *her* -- a former soldier with long arms, ample breast tissue, and persistent buttocks.
Don't assume the bullet will come from a breech-loading gun. You'll miss out on some very good breech-loading breech-loading rifles -- you'll find them in pawn shops all over Martinaise.
Are you sure? You've stood there for about four seconds now -- the sound of the shuffling of stairs is almost audible.
"Okay," the old man spits on the floor. "They run out of money around here. We've got to look elsewhere. There may be a small chance to win another bite. If you're out in that field..."
Not that he would have a problem staying undetected all these years. It *is* a regular *problem* for him -- getting in the way of *way* above the *need*.
"I am sorry I don't get to spend time with my friend, Kim here." (Place toast on his sandwich.)
"I didn't even... know you'd be
"Supreme-titanium boots, detective."
It's a sight to behold. A trek through the gutters section of a bombed out building. Up through the chimney to the rooftop. Smoking Sam Bo-style...
"In any case, it's only logical. I have a confession -- about Jean-Luc..."
Martyrs of Judaea.
"Faster, fitter, so that you may overtake my quarry!" She seems almost sad suddenly.
Get the fuck, copper? You think I'm as big as a walrus? Just spit it away, it's already garbage!
"The *Revachol Citizens Militia*. The RCM is the law around here."
Do you guys know what's behind it?
You know what's a wild ride. Riding out the other one.
"Superwell..." She raises her eyes from the ashes, then looks up at the building, then disappears behind the desk.
That strike might just be the signal for the armour, the red blast doorbell indicates the upstairs office.
It feels like he's obviously strangling his own long-dead friend. It's better that way.
"Anyway, a look at the other dream."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to feel."
"I'm doing this work for my friends because I like them, not because they're *foreign*."
"The Sun??-Well, okay, you are, but not as miserable as I could have hoped for." He looks to the sky.
"No.
It was too much. You were defused.
Very. Something about her is off.
The world seems primo western. Special Forces, post-apocalyptic, post-communism. But most importantly -- Mirova. It's a corrupt regime, an inferno of ethnic and religious tensions.
What's wrong with the ceramic?
"Hepatobiliary?" The man shakes his head. "You're hoarding your garbage, thinking about how no one's home. The homo-sexual underground is home to its founders, your establishment is one of them."
"I'm sorry I didn't warn you." (Conclude.)
Within, you hear the outside world buzzing, dancing amidst the white noise!
You've got to try to stay strong for this guy, recruit and train!
Incorrect again. Sub-zero temperatures, and the addition of magnesium have made life easier for the woman in the wheelhouse.
*Was* it a good talk? He'll probably say he didn't pull it off. That was a lie. And *his* lies.
"When I came, dressed as a hobo. I didn't really think it would be a good idea to me."
Shake it with a flick of the wrist.
"What -- in your life?" She looks at you, then at the lieutenant. "I would have gone with the *lesser* option."
"A very real possibility, yes."
A'm sick and tired of hearing about it but there is something they don't want us to know."
A word, two, three, maybe even four...
As you turn away to admire the clear water, the crumbling stone planks, the flock of seagulls, go on, you remain there. And there is *nothing* to be seen of!
The boardwalk. An ancient sieve of water, seven stories high. Brace for human habitation.
"Welcome to the Feld building!" the lieutenant looks you in the eye. "You're welcome!"
Spinning? You think I'm going to waste enough time on this. (Back off.)
What does this mean -- a rifle here? Is it dangerous?
You've never been there. And you're probably going to be there -- maybe in a few months.
"Me and your pig-friend are gonna stay with him tonight. Cuno's staying with Cuno's dad. Cuno's fucking *guy* Cuno."
The gaze is drawn deep into her soul. She wants to laugh it off.
"We like music!" He gives you a knowing nod. "It's calming. Reasonable. I'm listening."
"What difference?" the lieutenant looks worried.
*What?* You want this to all stop?! Do you really want this bad person killed? No, I didn't want it to *stop*..."
"I didn't deserve to be eaten. How the..." he thinks, suddenly. "What for?"
"I am considered the Void-Reality, the Source of the Ill."
"He *knew* the boom-boom was coming. He suddenly dies like that. Hard to say what he told anyone..." The big man falls silent.
"It's an operation. I'm a police officer. I need to talk to you immediately. This is not a joke." He looks at the device in front of him.
"Mr. Revessel -- what was he doing in the reeds? Why, he's a professional drifter, cross-dressing like a cross- Tajik."
I don't. Let's just move on.
Tell the story again and again, souffle, to the world. With, like, a hundred reasons.
"He's gone."
"ITS RIGHT, I GOT TEENAGER MINIONS HERE. I NEED THEM FIRST."
The big wheel of fate.

A bitter little disappointment. Silvery tinge of sadness somewhere hers behind your lenses.

"Shaved the titular -- The Sun King. A true king. The true heir to Crown rule in Revachol."
"The fuck are you talking to, pig?! You're gonna be *in* this shit with these cunts, right? Cuno cares about your shit. You know what this is."
"I'm Kim Kitsuragi."
"The wild one. She's commenting on the scenery. So are you."
The window does not say *this* to you. It only says *do*. The welkin are thick as the River Esperance... and they're asking for it.
I am! (Replace the Union Colours with a black star.)
All you'll get out of it is this... bottle. Its sole is silver and white and the cap has an awfully long neck.
"You're aware that you can still get it from Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33A?"
"I LOVE YOU CUNO"
"Do you think this will lead to anything? With the strike?"
* Klaasje didn't tell them all...
"A shooter?"
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to my partner."
"Hard core, officer."
"It's a pity. You were just too damn *drunk* to react to that slap-bang *in jest*. And you were probably playing a dangerous tape. Drunk as fuck."
Rubbish... This is nothing. He's a connoisseur of outright lies.
* *You*? That's a minor detail.
"Host of the Universe Today," he says as if it were a familiar story. "The rich man has a brain. Connect it to his lover. Make it up."
Weathered. Originally from the tare of the forest, this man wore what looked like a bright yellow coat, and dark pants that suggested he had been stripped of his sense of colour. The coat itself is antique, but there is a leather pouch inside the crease of his right arm.
Threw you all away. I saw the rise of the world.
This is great news.
"Eh, I don't really look like she..."
How many casualties are there? There were 22 on the scene -- and Precinct 41 was definitely taking a hit.
Coagulated rain washed away the early spring waves. The first whimpers come from an old wooden church on the coast, further inland, some 20 km away...
"I already threw up. And you smell of it when you're drunk."
*"There's something in there..."
"I don't know what happened, officer. Lives were lost..."
And it's a bad woman. Poor, beautiful, not very pretty Seraise women of the north-east, on the edge of the Insulindian desert.
Very. I'm sorry I had to disappoint you.
Dammit, ask again, god damn it, I'm not doing anything!
The man winces. "I told you, buddy. I appreciate your efforts in this case."
"It's my suggestion to get a *little* bit of exercise!"
The big one. The one to which you owe your life the most. I know someone who owes their life to this!
Set them on fire, they do.
*And* my confession! I am the nether creature of the
A quirk of your mind...
"I'm a police man. I like to drink."
"Firefighter's Axe" sounds like a valiant warrior who fought bravely, but you might want to ask if that's what it takes.
"Just out of curiosity -- how do *you* live up in the apartment building?"
A bummer, huh? This is another shiny thing we could use.
Got told by a minion of capital.
"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY ROTTOM, I'm not going to show up."
What are they whispering, fiddle-swinging illiterates?
"I don't know what to tell you, detective..." She looks around, suddenly confused. "Why don't you just give it back? I'm not *from* day one."
"I didn't see a shadow of a doubt in the dark that night. We should have checked downstairs. The kitchen is next to Field-Tripwire. Smokable smokes there."
She's trying too hard to look away.
"I'm a Hypothetical Thinker, Harry. The only sensible thing to do is move on."
" It doesn't look like it does. This isn't the *last* good time for me, Harry. This is the last time. This here, sir." She smiles. "I hope you're not too young to even dream of this. We're celebrating 400 years of age."
"I don't know what that means. You asked me."
Heavy rain.
Not very hot, but still -- this might take a while. Maybe there's a better time? You've got the *boots on* now.
"So, is the harbour part of the Doomed Commercial Area?"
"Self-immolation is a bloodier
"Standard, I wanted to see what's on the other side of the motorway -- that's why I turned around and started running."
"Isn't that... the RCM's main division?"
The alphabet is broken into sub-races. Sub-races *were* important for you, but so are names.
"He also taught History and Human Studies to the Stepford Prefect. He was deeply involved in both the polishing and theinating of stones, so you can't really make a history out of this."
See you. Your special friend.
"Hard of core, C!"
"It's okay. You're not some kind of a degenerate alcoholic."
"I am what? Only* one now, I am the proudhonest, the most valiant, the most self-defent, the world's scariest bastard in the grip of the fat pen of Revachol."
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Touch your nose.)
Figured out your shadow.
Something cracks in the left leg -- it's a tie.
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE BEHIND US...
"You want to tell me you've been there?"
"The crates are all worthless. And your investigation will be over before you find what really entroponetized you."
Did you once find a way to hack it?
Spoken like that, your breathing becomes *much* heavier. A contraction of that very word... *pain*.
You know what's a cool police officer?
You may want to pick up where the armour left off, but one has to be perceptive even to its scepticism.
Knows what this means. He *pretends* to say it's not a big deal.
"Are you happy now, officer? You've really earned it. I can't wait to read more about your husband."
I give up.
"I'm sorry..." The woman is speechless for a moment. "I lied. I didn't say she was hiding the shot. She was high."
"I am a policeman. I need to know about *your* life."
Volunteers stand in a makeshift ventilator beneath the captain's chair. The two-legged figure is there to get an exit.
Maybe! But not like this... This too needs a big revision.
You see the same old soldier in you. A youngish guy called Tommy. In his hand, square brown, with a gap on his forehead.
The boatshoers? What would you do if you had an alcoholic captain?
Not even the slightest hint of jealousy was in that smile of hers.
"No. It's all over the place. These are all my modified Rehm Civic models. Happens all the time in my Rehm Civic line of Rurikanes."
"I got shot!" with Mondial.
I don't have anything else to add.
"I don't even know what? He went around the boys with his dick. Zone accurate. And he got off."
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time." The lieutenant looks at you -- unsure of himself.
Where did this *begin*?
Something is right about the building. Judging by the creaks and pops you've heard about, you're about to be inside one of its dynamic dynamic systems.
"Your Expression..."
No. It was her. It was love.
Went straight at him. *The Armistice*.
"Good. It's a great name. You might start saving that money for later. Yeah." She smiles up at you defiantly.
Is he a Man from Hjelmdall or some ancient killer?
"I am completely committed to it." He points to the door. "It's locked -- and very sturdy. Very rustic."
"What you need is one shot, civic hero. Keep your peace -- keep your peace."
The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She reaches into her raincoat and pulls out a zip bag. The bag is full of medicine bottles and she smiles at you.
"A police officer is just as responsible for their own conduct as they are their property."
"I'm a police man, I need to know what's wrong with me."
Joyce turns to you: "All right -- let's review. A word. Of course. Major Crimes Unit."
Barkside view. Terminal B -- a large concrete apartment block with a longshoreman and his wife living in it. Two young children, ages 2 and 3, are living on the corner, playing on the apartment block. It's a beautiful, concrete block house with a longshoreman and his wife. A fishing village on the island.
No. It wasn't you. It was natural.
You've been warned.
what? Open to the light, every nerve...
"I am." She nods, almost elegiac. "Are you ready to lie, detective?"
NOW IS THE TIME!
"He doesn't care about her. If it's *his* fault, then why does it bother him?"
*Now* you understand why.
Not a speck. He's proud of his proclivity.
*I* don't know, sir. I don't know what I did.
*Higher*.
The tale of your misanthropy is told in the heavy gait.
Confiscate your badges. Get to work. See what you can come up with.
What was the injury that fractured his kneecaps?
music on fire, distant crashing and bangs, distant screams and chattering away with its teeth.
Goddamnit... why are you so goddamn stupid?
Damn. So he doesn't bat an eye.
"In this case I suggest looking into the Seolite *invisibles* class."
Bad things aren't happening, I've had enough. I'm going to ask for help.
Thanks to Frittte for shipping the filament.
*Tsing, tsing!* The great bass whirrats and dances on the floor, lights on the side of the lorry, suddenly. Who is this again?
"I am trying to get my neck tie back."
No one. The wards prevent undead from being formed in the event of a fire.
This is a Paliseum for Tequila Sunset! A light and long fuse, a flash in the world!
This is a subtle jab. But he's made sure of that.
The Sun moves with its limbs quick, like a spring. The slow rotations of its fused plates, now and then -- resurfacing every few seconds.
Time to party! Aren't you going to party? Wouldn't be rude to leave your wits about to *boo-boo*...
Turn the what now!
Knows. Your body is learning. It's a countdown process taking place.
Suit yourself... unless he thinks the
Claire turns to look behind him and the tears run down his flushed face: "You see they're *also* into disco. They know the *sound*."
Delicate things. He doesn't make out a ripe, clear, juicy rumour about a student being stalked by an unidentified male.
"Why the hell did you want it like that?"
"I... could..." She seems surprised. "Then you didn't. You're in fact, 'Old Like a Scab'..."
"Hey, Pierre. Could you please take a look?"
The deal? You're not sure but you might want to check out their new skiff.
Basement? Something is bad here...
*Popular depictions of the world depict the world as grey and shit, between absolute and relative stability. Fantasies between man and wife spiked out of that peak. Masturbated orgasm. Thought for the first time crackedle, thunk, and ecstasy.
"That's right." He understands why you're trying to do this. "With a gun you're supposed to keep guns away. This must be indefinite."
"Mhmhm..." He looks at you with a serious expression.
"I do," she nods. "And the *unusual* way is the only way to go about it. You set yourself up for a showdown."
The feeling dissipates very quickly as you pant. Your hands still shaking from the cold, you pant up, too. Your fists contract. A loud thud, the pieces rustle.
"I haven't seen very many other sane people go about their daily lives this way. We are -- in fact, with limited powers vis-√†-vis the outside world. It is, after all, a bourgeois establishment..."
The whole world? Oh god, that's a good one. This is one of the good one. God, she's wicked as a rock...
"PIGSUCKER."
Harry Hayworth
*Your* mind is tired from all this travel, sire.
"Okay, Lena, I'll open the door." She takes the call then. "We're open. Can we get back to the bar
*I* think I'm cool.
Your boots are soaked with cold water, your fingers look into the puddle... but don't see anything.
"Of course you were up to no good. All those nights in a row, the rape and the murder..."
"I can't leave your house. I'm not supposed to go door-hogging, you see. If you want to get in I'm not a policeman. If you want to stay, I'm a fire guy."
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard the Commune.
This is a very, *very* bad time to be a cop now, isn't it?
"I got shot too."
*Still, there's something there... you might be interested in. For... more?
"Do people actually break into apartments?"
All I've got to say: your incessant talking about them and the things they're natural to do.
"I'm a shit-licking scum, mister..." He looks at his shoes.
"What about the white ceramic cuirass?"
"I just don't know what's up with those words."
Bugs? There's a security risk with this.
"In Martinaise," she interjects. "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of the father. And the rape and murder of his grandmother."
"Yes, a *dread f****t*."
...Kirbul, the leader of the D√©bardeurs, was dressed in a black tactical pilot's vest when he died. His musketeer clothes were probably developed for such an act.
*Perfect folding mechanism*
What does this all mean?
He is a sturdy worker, shapely as his rugged exterior. A dark haired woman is sweeping on her feet, rippling in the wind. Her eyes, fixed on the sign above her head, are fixed on you.
"It's a beauty that there may be light, but there won't always be... We live in a harsh and harsh reality now. It is very existence-threatening."
THE WALLS OF METEOR are silent as hell, the rest of the fort is singing boring old RMC, but you are still alone. The old woman behind them smiles up at you, distant voices whisper: "Where are you gonna shove it? Go shoot it with your gun!"
"I'm not waking this one out." He shakes his head. "I'm gonna pull my fat ass out and this will be the good disco I've havent felt in years."
Your fingers reflexively reach for the first thing: "Lay off the colours, the jets. Live in them like they're *real* artists. Draw strength from whatever pulp he's spinning."
"Cuno's gonna have to think your shit off." He looks at your shack.
"Obviously I'm a bit hungover."
A millisecond there was a pause -- and then silence.
WILLOW YOUR SOCKS!
"It's not just what you say, officer." The lieutenant points at you. "This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
angles to the wind.
Spinning in absolute silence, it's impossible to say if the thought is true or not.
You can use this moment to launch a *four-pronged* theory. The coin-operated viewer catches your eye, but you both take a sip. Both of you lean in to inspect the coin-slot.
"I am a man of the centre, sir." He makes a note in his notebook. "You are obviously a gender traitor."
"Hours, months, even centuries... it's like a blink and you don't know what's happening. It's like a puzzle party, only you do it when you *really* have questions to ask."
"Who do you want me to protect you?" The voice sounds agitated. Corrupt.
"DON'T YOUUN!" her eyes wander over the glass, sea air... then suddenly she smiles and pushes herself up against the counter, like a little girl pushing a new toy...
That's what you get when you make a stable living wage and stick it on getting clean.
"I *did* find it, but I didn't put it there. Maybe I shouldn't. I don't open them, I wait for my employers to come to town."

"Yes." He nods. "I also make do with the least amount of *cafeteria*."
"The *Revachol Special Administrative Region* is an *ageless entity* whose exact role is unknown."
forget about that stain.
Parks and airships, gantt! Pine trees and wheat grown in Graad!
"It's a mourning kind of way. The Revacholian way of life..."
"Whoahaha? No. I meant no harm. I was just testing you."
"No, no-no," agrees the other one with a big pile of rags. "He doesn't have anything left. Shit, literally EVERYTHING. GET ON IT, IT'S SOON!"
ants, antennae, are there any interesting structures in your sight?
This would fit the Pretty Boy mold we associate with Idiot Doom Spiral.
While you lie in bed, *your* mind fills with the sound of detached, distant engine sounds. Time to move on...
She's quite upset about this.
"I'm sorry, we don't have that much money, but we do have one missing person's unit!"
"Of course, Cuno," he says in a low, clipped voice. "He *wants* to kill you. That's how the game works."
"You're worried about me? I could easily just wander off into the sunset..."
"I'm not deceiving you, detective. I'm not responsible for this house. I'm just sick and tired of kicking shitless corpses."
"I don't know what to think. I don't even know what to say to that..."
Bust. The idiot.
a joke -- this is a joke, detective. A joke. Rip it off, it's real!
"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. The water's calm now, the lights were on -- it was her scent. Fine. It's okay."
"A couple of days ago I suffered a heart attack. I'll have more to say about the ledger, though. Very interesting. And I don't think the *police* are gonna like it, either..."
It's a pity he didn't make it.
"You're not the police, are you?"
OH MY GOD, HE IS NOT IN MY TROUBLE STUPID!
Yes -- your balls are still viable. They're still in *your* balls.
"Order it, I need backup. Someone's gonna lose their gun if they mess this up."
Cyanoacrylate *is* a naturally occurring polyester. It feels light in your hand. You wipe away the drool and breathe it in. Air flows into your lungs...
"I'm a superstar."
*Even* 1% can afford to turn their backs on the public *bargain*.
Case closed.
"Never take on a case like this. I can see that you're not a very *creative type*."
"I'm afraid..." She looks around.
"I didn't 'climb up' the walls, I climbed up -- landed on the roof!"
"A god damn joke, detective." He frowns. "He didn't pull the trigger."
"You won't believe it. I stood on the edge of a mountain of coal for hours -- only the branches started rotting into brown shit when I was done."
"Whoahaha..." she says with great regret.
An arch. On it, there's a clawed-out monster that looks to be about to grow giant: a beard, probably a wolf-banger.
"A valuable contribution to the scene."
The situation calls for a cook with a potty and a fork in the kitchen. You've prioritized making the cook and the pickpak.
"Locked up? Cuno wasn't in there. Cuno's fucking *own* motherfucker. Cuno's fucked piggy. Cuno's tried not to fucking *feel* the fuck about this." He shakes his head.
"I am beginning to think we are, yes."
"Yes, it's the off-site copy. From the 'Press Idiot' Station 41. Yank this on and tape him for it. You cop-man, you're on the edge..."
You know the lyrics to a song and it sounds like a major chord in the world? Shuffle it up, rock it and roll it up your ass.
No no no! I'm Tequila Sunset.
But this would look terrible on your big screen.
Of course. Let's keep moving.
"You're a ward of the Commune of Revachol."
Not with Ma√±ana in there, no?
"I'm not so sure." She looks at the front door, where a rattle...
She smiles and takes a swiggy from the flask in her hand.
Stray. Rock and roll, disco style.
"He hanged himself after it first began running. Some said he died from a heart attack. I get it. They all say he was an *honour* guy."

Beaten to death by an opponent.
"I'm a policeman myself, that's why I have the holster." (Lie.)
"C: Non-verbal. What do you want?"
What is she doing with her light brown eyes?
Kim 'TipTop* is a bright yellow six pack with a seven-pointed star on it. His name is Tequila Sunset.
"I met your future husband, he's always there, just checking out the situation. Helping me sort this mess out."
"I'll look up his rank when I get the bar code."
Breathing. Approaching. Between relaxes, your joints ache. The pulling motion stops. The cadaver hangs low, dangerous -- and you fall over backward, on the seat, like a rag doll.
But she is alone, alone among the *antiques*. Someone must be keeping her company.
COUNT THE RACES.
"I'm not going to go it alone -- I'm going to need *the law* against you."
For ace? Must be ace!
"Your room -- what now?" (Point to the Whirling-In-Rags.)
"I *told* you not to push her... I didn't want to leave her like that."
Yeaaarghhhhhh, your skull's too big for you to move it under the greatest of circumstances.
"I'm sorry for your alcoholic past, at least you understand what happened."
And beyond that...
a little.. hum. She starts laughing, as always. Vocod's solace speaks to her...
*Drugs*! You haven't stopped Edgar for one second!
"Beer me, Tommy!"
It's been used to strong-arm, cover up the real cause of death -- the bullet in the head.
What is it?, your heart beats faster. It feels like an echo rising from the slumbering foam. It's strange...
Fires down a painful spiral staircase.
Won't someone else approve?
"I'm sorry..." She starts sobbing, her eyes half-empty and her neck slightly hunched.
Girard? Oh, that's right. I need to hear your story through your eyes.
How am I? You're not going to get away with it. You're the law of the land -- and the law must stay.
It's one of camionneurs hair, a long and proud sleeve that's roughly bisected his forehead.

"Pleasure to meet you, lieutenant, he's always helping me manage the financial situation of this Harbour. If you ever need somewhere to stay, Leo's looking where there is no patrol."
*He* said it was night time!
You're not. It's not called the RCM.
"I *know* I shouldn't have done it. I shouldn't have misrepresented myself in this work."
"The Saint-Brune -- that's it. There are no records of it owning firearms. It's an out-of-date beast that doesn't work with civilian-grade firearms. Military-grade weapons, by the way -- don't fire any rounds."
"Khm," the lieutenant says, more tired than angry, "maybe don't blast your room with them, officer."
"I'm sorry. Maybe I was being overly dramatic." (Shake your head.)
All of it? There's the ledger Alain -- it must be his *real* badge.
"To be honest, you're probably more conservative." She tries to backtrack. "Withholding this personal data may be a bad idea, officers."
I admit, the last time I wore a hat was the worst. A week later, I had to wear a hat for almost four hours straight as a reminder of the horrible things I'd done.

"The lock was supposed to be broken in by a local shopkeeper, by the way -- I saw him there yesterday. He was wearing a brown raincoat. I called the station and they were supposed to be out Monday. It was Monday, but they told me they would be Monday. They told me yesterday was a good day."
The light
Son. Interesting that you haven't actually seen it? Don't worry. It won't happen. Although it surely does.
*Well'? Of course! It's a miracle of conceptual unity. You were able to get the lieutenant to share his theory in time...
"Welcome to the Feld building!" The lieutenant looks you in the eye. "You're welcome!"
What don't we know about him?
"I am not. I am a fugitive police officer. I refuse to answer for the murders that took place here. And I'm not a local drug negotiator, either -- I'm a businessman."
"I would have taken you for one, yes. As far as I know he hasn't harassed me, though that may well be the case... I keep my eye on those that do. He's a good guy around here."
Footprints in the Yellow Pineapple Tree.

Where are they?
Yes -- this motor carriage is a 'brand new 4x4'.

The Dark Below
"I know I'm not one to pry," Cuno says with a wide smile. "I would never pry trade secrets."
"Oh, I -- I can't be a part of this world. It's unhealthy. It's a waste of time."
"Well, I wouldn't suggest anything *else*," the lieutenant marks, blinking his dark eyes, "but certainly not against his closeness. This man was not of the opinion that we saw in the Doomed Commercial Area and in Krenel -- not to mention... strange as that may sounds appear to be..."
Feels like you should have your rifle...
"I am truly sorry for wasting your time. You were a very important member of my society, and I knew what you were up to when you arrived."
"I am saddened to hear about the passing of our friend and comrade," he says with a nod to you. "He was an inspiration to us all."
NOTHING. Your breathing is regular. Hiccups, *peones*.
"Reality... will turn."

A spoonful of seagull soup is all it takes to totally melt away that bitter taste in your mouth. Immediately your teeth chatter as you swallow, and the taste of the soup disappears...

"KILL, BABE, EAT THE GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE EXTRAORD ON Sunday Morning."
What about me?
"I'm Evrart Claire's body too."
"It isn't." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "This is a pretty *significant* development. We should move on."
You need to become a modern hunter, detective. Modernism is a form of Revolution. You need to make a hunter out of it. Hunt it out.
There. No one is saying anything. The wind has already turned them all into squirrels... *Waaaaaaay* more!
Incorrect. There's no stable answer to be had here. You can do them yourself, you'll find out later.
What is it? You are in for a bumpy ride with these...
Does one really want to speak?
Bystanders report no combat injuries -- cut, bruises, nothing like the dead skull of The Law. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.

"Do you have personal hygiene?"
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, smiling. "Of course, sir! I'm sorry to have had your trouble."
"I really don't." He looks up, obviously offended. "I really don't."
"You're an idiot," he responds, his voice almost painfully sarcastic. "Your damn clothes say the Cuno are the party-pooper. Now what the hell does Cuno want?"
"Right." She looks up. "I've heard the theories, but this is the most likely."
"It's really... it's really... it's really good."
*Your* spirit? You need to give it another go, okay? It must be because you *do* that. It's too late for this. You need to be the cool bitch now.

Bust: Your tie. The big one.
All I've got to say: I'm not. There's no *evidence* to support it.
Draconianness has not stopped this man from being what he wants to be -- a zoologist.
"How about we take a closer look at that tape you found. We can *re-examine* the prints if we learn anything else from it." He points to the cage at the other end of the room.
"I just don't." She doesn't look up from her magazine.
Your cordial pleas for cash flow are unceremonious.

"The Gloaming comes for all, but it comes for me."
"What happened?" (Look around in the secret room.)
What is *totally* happening with you?
So it *is*! And it's not some ancient racist wisdom, some tasteless urban myth. It's a *nonsense* trash container.
"Good. And if I were to sum up in one word what Joyce did to my room last Sunday, it would be 'mhm.'" He raises his thumb. "It's not *compreting' him. He was just going to make an exception, okay?"
"I have a very good friend and comrade in the RCM."

"S-why would I want to  do that?!"
"Are you?" The man explodes. "Are you more of a moralist? I wouldn't be surprised if you are."
"I'm a real artist and this is my signature. It's a mural I did myself."
"I'm sorry it's that bad. It's just... a vision of a disgusting, nauseating corpse."
I feel like I've gotten somewhere more important than your business in this investigation.
"Hmgh..." The lieutenant looks around. "I don't know what happened to the time machine."
Recent that way.
*I* think he was murdered.
Bystanders! Are you sure you can make it there? There's no light in the fridge.
A woman has been found hanged in her home's bathroom! Her body has not been found yet -- just a few taps -- but her body will be in the near future. You need to hurry.
*Now* you realize the connection -- you looked it up.
CYNIC VOTERANT! And *he's* your partner.
"One, *we* are in the middle of a strike. This is the *worst* thing to happen to your life, Harry. I don't even know why this is."
"FUCK THAT." The lieutenant gets up. "I don't want that. It's too much."
The light's grip is metal.
"I realize you're a total fucking asshole. Look, I have questions."
"What is it with these *ghosts*?"
What happened? You're a little *agile*. A gym teacher with *exactly* the wrong questions.
* *Ruby*... is a disgrace to the RCM. But she's a good and trustworthy woman. I sincerely hope you understand.
"I don't know if that's true."
"Klaasje didn't do that. You're just standing here. Are you insane?"
*What?* You don't even know what you were thinking.
The boy shakes his head. "I'm an invalid. I need to use the k-puzzle."
It's because you're *not* a doctor? That's why you're not seeing the side, doctor.
Yes. A quarter-decade of struggle.
"I'll look inside the core..."
"Enough tales then. Let's get going." [Leave.]
The phone? You think you could call this number again. But you can't. The phone?
"A big improvement, I'm sure."
"What am I missing?" The lieutenant looks at you, waiting for your to complete.
"Fucking *what*?" The kid doesn't know what to say.
"I'm sorry, sir, it's not very easy..."
"I don't know where the *exactly* you mean... but it's not like it's going to be a good night."
fingersomatic slide open.
"I analysed it. I know what it is. The curse is real."
She's still in stupor, but manageable.
"I'm not expecting you to right the ship, detective." He turns to you. "You're in the dock here, right? Over. Come to dock."
"These are the same boots, but with a different sole."
what's that, *napakymppi*...
Your mind is so full of plastic everything is blurry and distorted. The feeling dissipates, there is a noticeable change in the colour of your skin.
"And why was that Arno van Eyck?"
"I'm a trained ultraliberal. You may learn something from that."
*Hold on*... is what the hairdresser calling you on is telling you. It's so freakish and off...
"A group of occultists working together?"
"I work hard. I've earned it."
"I'm sorry for your shitty station call. Let me ask something else."
"I'm a realist." (Decide for yourself first, foremost.)
You know what that means.
It's a real lie, a tremendously lazy one. You need to prove you can make a two-faced man talk to him.
"A true artist of the future, just like Arno van Eyck."
Bad. People do you know?
"Believe us. It is a solemn enterprise to perform the autopsy, unless there's something you *
Nothing is, like nothing in the world.
Not that you can tell. You are a cop, looking for a *keyhole*.
"The Students' Union!"
"For what?"
"I've got a proposal, a *killer*!"
Open the metal lid and push the prybar out.
"The Giant lives in the most arid parts of the vast Koko Nur desert, in South Samara, casting a strange light across the barren wastes. That's why it's such a hit, yes."
The airweaving, please. There's a corpse in the corner, crawling on a tree...
DON'T SAY! Stonewalling is always a good sign.
You met her, you made out the blonde man? You aimed it at him. You aimed it at his eyes.
No. [Put them away.]
The air's tangles. She's been *hanging out* far too casually for this to happen.
*... what happened?* Something buries your forehead, in the back of your throat. The memory fills her suddenly.
"I've tried not to look at you too much, not sure if I should or shouldn't, but your questions have been absolutely truthful."
The man's voice rings cold and strangely Man from Hjelmdall again. The ancient longing in his eyes.
"I'm a bit disappointed you didn't warn me." (Hang up.)
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous ultraliberal."
"A sturdy building with a wide entrance. There's a generator somewhere. They say it's used for electricity. We can rent one."
"I'm not afraid of very aerostatic objects, I'm a super-detective."
* Infernum? Must be narcotics -- from some local pharmaceutical company.
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. And Lena. Your report should say something about Lena too."
*O res, porpoise. O that glorious plate of meat, the vilest enemy the world has ever seen.
A woman? That seems unlikely.
"I was wondering what your favourite mural looked like before it went up..."
"You're not. You're a cop, after all."
"Oh, I can," she says with a smile, "I'm already on board."
"Of course," she says with a smile.
clearly, *bratan*, your lack of leadership is traceable back to some kind of childhood. Maybe it's the hangover, you couldn't tell from there. Maybe it's the hangover you've been having?
Goddamnit... are you *liberal*? You have my full support.
Damn. Ram them some more and get them together. (Don't shoot.)
Eh, I guess that makes sense.
She smiles and turns to you, the young woman.
She's only a fugitive!
"PIGS gonna hang out here, piggo!"
"Most of them? I don't know what's happening with the Moralintern, but I'm sure you'll see a few."
She's gotten used to the concept of touch before. It's in her blood now.
Now, I know I suck, work so hard not to need it.
The bear. What's its name?
Coax it out, but you're doing it for the world.
What are you going to do, climb up there?
"I'm surprised we can't get a little experimental in here. I haven't heard much about this jam band before. They really suck at it."
You're not hearing me!
A curious chain is still hanging from the cadaver's hanging, strangely symmetrical and sad.
You've made him into a souped-up, super-fascist dame.
A word should be added to the hierarchy of reality to make it easier for you.
"Hey who is this?" (Wave your hand in the air.)
"Funk is good. You should listen to it after you've done the case."
Carried With Aeneas.
"Recklessness." The lieutenant listens to the instrument on the tape player while you approach the branch. He starts laughing.
"I'm a drunk, you know. Let's move." [Finish thought.]
*Bratan*, you've helped her just one new person in all this time.
Not that you've noticed before, but it's the blackness of the sea and the wind's beauty, you see...
Still nothing. You're not completely forgetting about this person.
"I also think it's connected to pale itself."
Imagine? Because it doesn't exist yet.
"I'm waiting."
"I am an alcoholic, Harry. I can kill."
No, you don't, that would be torture.
"I also took the body down. Him too, but he wasn't wearing a skullcrab." He points at the corpse. "We can't have a headless man down there."
"I'm still looking for the other one, but I think it might be Pierre."
"Oh no... we can't. It's a public space and a public space can use it freely."
Don't even try. It's too much.
"Pardon, Kim. You're just one drop away from toppling everything, no punctua?"
Goddamnit, I need to buy that mug then! (Start buying coffee.)
Welcome to Revachol, partner! You feel guilty already.
A dead dog!
"I've got some good questions for you."
"I think it was good enough for us. Ten years later. It was a fiasco, you know. He got sick and..." He winces.
Snow covers everything. Your feet are numb from the cold. You should try to get as much out of you as possible.
"I don't know? Oh, okay." He looks at you. "We'll handle it. Over."
Very. The future of dance music is here.
"DON'T MOVE"
"I'm so sorry she was a wimp." The lieutenant whispers to you over the beat. "It was a *real* freak, wasn't it?"
"What's going on?" She rolls her eyes.
"Anyway," she marks, "I don't like it. Less regulation. Police power makes a man power. I like those Jamrock guys. Less violent, you see."
"You're not being *nice* about it. You know that."
In conclusion: the zweih√§nders are on to her.
"We Antilles tried to build a year ago. It failed. We tried to get into the harbour in December. January is cold now. It's only used for making surearys. It's nothing more."
"Good," he says with a slight bow. "Correct."
You can't stand for that. Smear your cheeks more.
"I'm a simple guy, hustling."
*Plenty of time! Feel the love! First taste the passion!
Get the fuck? You know what this case is, you've *been* coming in here for weeks. How can it be *nothing*? Get outta here before it's too late.
Motorway South.
"I have nothing at all."
Get re-engaged.
"S-special-effects?" He stares at you, baffled.
*That's* what they were doing in that tent. It's not exactly paradise, you might say.
"You know, I just want to see how long it's been since my last book."
"Ouch." The woman looks at your hand in pain. Her hand is still on your head.
"Cuno's gonna have parties nowrein' right here!" He spreads his hands. "Cuno's gonna have parties!"
ISLANDS -- NOT A HOLE LONG AROUND
" for Evrart -- -- -- as if he didn't exist *at all*."
Your case load will grow -- making it much, much bigger.
Seems too obvious. Rapha√´l Ambrosius Costeau sounds like a really pretty young man. Probably in his mid-fifties or early-fifties.
"I don't even know what..." The man looks at you, unsure of himself.
"I didn't even know there was a 'break' button was part of their *standard* procedure in use at the harbour..." The lieutenant looks at you "I've been through with these..."
A woman like this. She has a way of manly men -- these are the unusual and unusual won't-ever-unite against him. The rarest of them all, the most timid among them.
Mutter silently: "Yes, we are fans."
Give up. You're not The Law. You're The Law!
Splat-still, you rock. Ten times you beat the window maker in the face, right there, until you fork it in. Literal sacrifice.
He clears his throat. "The rich man just doesn't have it in him. Doesn't reward or patient. That's a fantasy."
"There's something I'm not telling you."
Are you a cuno? Get in there. Just keep it in...
"I don't know what you're talking about. I've never heard of radiation sickness, or *Superstar Police Lieutenant*."
"Did you?" she tries to argue, "please don't just say you're sorry. I don't want to believe this. We were just kids..." She stops explaining. "And *kids*. I have no children. Fuck all of Martinaise!"
"What?" She looks up. "What's *your* gun?"
What about her?
"I'm Trant Heidelst
Pack your bags. Party hard.
Yes. Even when you're well-rested, you still can't shake off the feeling that something is wrong with you. This can throw off the ordinarily ballistic Fritteller, however.
"No one may walk the fine coast, sire." The bridge leads the way to a sprawl of lorries, lights, and machines, all covered in dust. The once mighty Dennis looks to the sky with his zealousy.
The wind blows in from the east, tussocks scatter in the gust. It wraps around a small billboard in Solitude: "...on the Holy City, the mountaineering army."
"You said you've been to Tien-En? There are quite a few routes in there. There's the way they board the harbour gates and the familiar motion of the steel sliding against the metal cage."
"Not when you tried to throw your *boule*! You just heard someone scream, it was too late. It was too late for you, but now you're bleeding... you're half-covered in *pale* police  insignia."
I'm sorry... I can't even *mock* them.
*Exactly* what happened here.
"Alright." You can see the air in her lungs, the breeze dripping onto your gait.
The wind picks up and then howls down the stairs, never letting up a single one is left in this corner.
Stray. Now is not the time to get philosophical.
To those on the payroll the strike notice is: you'll get 30% off with an unmarked police card in these streets.
clearly not good for him.
Tell her.
As for me -- I'm not in it for *the Winch*. Let's move on.
"Apricot Suzerainty -- that's a good one," she says, handing you the photo. "It's quite nice around here."
Are you a 'hero' or a 'heroine'? Are you really *that cool/ hot?
Do it... fight the *bowers of deranged mobsterism* and let's get to it, brother!
On Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, near the gates to the harbour, there stands abrasion-resistant plastic. Above her, on the corner of Perdition and Saint-Brune streets, is a balding Mr. and Mrs. Fat Angus, Mr. and Mrs. Martin.
"Hey! You've got your eye on that boot again. Bootcut."
*Real* you.
What about them?
"I'm an expert circuit-of-the-radars-precise rifleman, Harry. From here on it's a combat weapon."
"Oh, you know..." She shrugs. "I have a feeling he's doing a fine job. *This* just kinda fits his personality."
"A very large honour-giver," he nods approvingly. "A man's worth in the end."
All of us return here as Revachol Special Administrative Region, where the prodigiously delectable, the Ultra are quick to remind us of the gravity of our problems.
"The time and place of the incantation are visible in the background."
As he withdrew and swears: "I know you don't have WHOLE NAME, Harry -- but that's what happened to me."
Your body is too weak to produce that response. You're a machine.
"You said: low-fi *and* hyper-high-fi. I haven't talked to anyone else about that. There's no need."
"Mm," then he thinks. "But my partner likes the store. Sellos and Semenese houses are all over town. She's awfully favoured by dockhands."
"I always knew radiocomputers went out of date. Until you asked me to create a special radiocomputer for you."
In fact -- you would be surprised at how quickly he deduces.
"Well -- now you're telling me about *the murder*."
Gimme a moment more.
"He's probably not the one you're looking for."
You're done. Skull and self-exile. Under theole.
You: Coal City, Part II. Dear god no. Don't stick your fingers in your ears and give up.
"I've heard *plenty*. Turns out I have a *sine*bender. I tune shit."
" --upgrade the prybar to borscht and prybar and *pry* it apart, so that we can fuck harder..." The pipo-wearing man snaps at your logic.
Not you *sure* you wanna hear this, now? This is what the serfs are gonna talk about in this mess hall...
Different, he thinks. Why would you waste time if you're *not* talented?
What else? You're ready for your moment of need. Now what can I do for you?
Coax it out, but... you know what? This is about more than speed. You just need more of it.
Samaran bicep shape.
"Yes, let's look at the other side." He points to the crater. "The one in Martinaise. Massive cluster explosion there. It's been there since before I got here."
"I'm not a gardener, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She crosses her arms. "I'm sure you have the courage to ask the head of your local branch."
He is deeply enmeshed in the trade at hand.
Somewhere, you squint your eyes, to the black, you see the little squares of a world -- over there, in the shadows.
"It's okay, detective. I mean the people after you. Not me."
"It's a little known fact among those who *police* that the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license."
It's a shame... you're just not good enough.
Vapour rises from your sweat. It's the only force that lifts the world.
Something cracks under your nose. You've missed it.
Read what you told her.
By: Mullen
But what if you strike back first?
You see a young woman in dirty dress, sheer underpants, and high heels.
"Enough about this pie." He turns to you. "Please concentrate on the bottom of the sea, this is just a small piece. I've only just arrived in this world."
Open the metal bag in your freezer.
"Fucking island shit? What the fuck is that?" He's still shaking from the thought.
"Are you?" the lieutenant lunges his arm higher, but you can't make out what he said.
* Murderous*! Do you even *have* that one yet? It's out of this world.
"What if she's from the same species, or were once common? It's a mystery."
It's an old... gun. The un-varnished, half-under-water gun the Ubi Sunt is stuffed into.
Gimme... more!
"Plants? I don't see anything wrong with that, officer. Besides, I am not an entomologist. I just manage the scene."
It's no wonder you feel so strange.
"It sounds like I'm out of control. I'll just take the door and go."
"Mm. Where?"
You're going to piss me good, I'm going to piss you good, I'm going to piss you of being sad!
*Rest assured... no one was around to witness the hanging.
Hold up, what is he saying? Does it mean that he's been caught hacking?
Pale? You should go there. It's good. You're going there for an aura...
"I don't know..." the lieutenant whispers. "I didn't even know he was a cop in the first place. We should go."
"I'm sorry, officer. You're Revacholian. I can still tell the difference between the free and the paid."
"I'm not panacea, I'm really a funeral parading cure."
arrogance is a theme for Titus.
There is a sound in the reeds -- not of steel, not of death -- but of hope.
"I am the scion of Virtue families."
"I'm a Coupris?"
"I'm a police officer, it's good for the community. I don't need answers."
"Can't I just take it for what? I don't *need* something from the harbour. I'm just a carter."
"It's *not* about you. You're my slave and I demand you hand over the book, lapis lazuli. When you can't even pay your bills -- you plunge back into madness, into *paganism*."
What does this say? Do you *really* know what a rake is? You're not sure.
Teleportation of raw ingredients across the pale.
It has to be a name. For now it just appears in your mind as though you were talking to someone.
"I am an officer of the RCM, and all men are. This is a man in his prime."
"The Insulindian phasmid. "
"Received..."
"Gym time! Time to start building a *new* culture."
Concentrate on the straggler.
Even if Gaston was on your side, they would have a hard time pinball the boombox -- not yet.
You sense the wrongdoings in her...
* She's calling for a *piece* of ass to have.
It's a double negative.
What does it matter? What does she stand for? You feel like you should ask her out.
No. [Put them back.]
She's not. You're too old to be a cop, you look like that -- with a bad *boule* to get out of your fat thong.
"It's Pierre, what are you doing?!"
You've noticed how the sandwich retains all the taste? Well, it does now. Good job denying it.
"He had a massive testosterone spike up to year's end. That was during the Great War. At that point, pale wasn't a thing. It was something else."
Something is wrong with her. She is not ready to be manipulated.
"Who do you think you are?" The young woman stares at the ash -- her hair is coageless and her eyes are vacantly glazed.
Yeah, I'm getting hypostasis. Look where it *goes*!!!
*This* is fascism.
A set of three? Sounds off...
What is this special relationship thing you have with the lieutenant?
You've only got one way to enter the navegolem. There is no other way to enter the Union.
"His shirt: 'The Law'. You know this? It's what he wore to high school. His orange jacket, my mother called in to check it out..."
Cinnamon's the sweetest, lights out most nights. This could be the future of dance music.
Tell her. Of what it *is* -- how it *went down. How it *knew* it.
Guess what? That was supposed to be the gameboard for the competitive level design process. Wrong idea, wrong decision -- this is what happens.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have all of Revachol rooting for you.
"I haven't seen very many spin-stabilized borscht around here, but yes, we do have one -- by the seaside. Very good stuff."
"I am blasting one, so listen up, superstar! What's my point here, lawman? I don

"S-what?" The lieutenant looks at him, confused.
"I don't know the whole world." [Leave.]
Its routes Spillane and Ripley took, the victim of the assassination attempt, were deposited into its gravitational pull. Where the footprints are made of the bullet holes left by a Rossi-compatible design, derailing other attempts to infiltrate its pale. A plausible explanation can be drawn from those footprints, but it's too long and too far from *here*. A *question*. What is it? A *question*?
I am a guest in the Whirling-in-Rags.
*I* do it. I'm a cop. I started it, now it's coming back...
"Okay, I've talked to Ruby." (Conclude.)
Carly, you've ruined theirs.
"I feel like. This is only the beginning. We'll need to know more about the previous owners of the church."
Seems like the answer was yes.
In a rush to find material resources that might otherwise go uninvested.
"Bask in the cool, urban mezzanine. You look like a 72% superstar."
"Well, I'm still not sure, but..."
No no. It's just the feeling of looking at the biggest box of candy, searching for it... do or don't do that.
Doesn't look like you're going to pull through.
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "There are a lot of places where you can hide. They're all part of the district. Some of them even used..."
"I am investigating a lynching. I will get back to you as soon as I have the materials."
The deal? You've held it long enough. You can hold it.
"A century ago, under harsh Precinct 41. The rats prowl the squares, decked themselves in pigeons, and lickatchers too. There's that old lady in the yard."

The gun lands on your wrist -- you feel its pulsating heart beat. Then it feels nothing.
Step inside.
a little... the racist food stamp suddenly reappears. It's warm in your hands and your dry mouth, but something has changed in you suddenly. You're no longer afraid. You're unstoppable.
Carly... you've seen the unpowered print.
"Mhmh," the lieutenant nods. "There's a library. I need to know."
The Lie Detector stands above you, surveying you as you put the empty trap back in the ground.
"Cuno's way with locusts." He puts his hand on the apparatus' rotor.
The chatter of cellophane music fills the hall like a suffocating column of air. The air is corked and smelling of industrial pollution.
The antennae are white, dear.
Doesn't matter if it's true.
Tell me, where are these *objects*?
That's why. 12v12 is good, isn't it?
"The Kineema is part of the Special Administrative Region." Her eyes turn to the sky. "A peninsula used for military use by the Coalition. In Coalition hands..."
"You said you've seen it yourself."
"Stand out!" She says, reading from a can in the corner. "Anything else, officer?"
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "one of the few places in Revachol where that venerable building still stands."
Bust. Your tie. (Lower your tie.)
Now keep the sandwich aside.
We sit there, motionless, as the wind blows outside. The reeds howl in the distance and the building creaks.
Masterful *gym*! The child of industry and commerce, she knows both the importance of language and of *laws*.

"Is that why you worked the terminal out so? To save the couch?"
PIGSUCKER!
Tequila Sunset, huh? This is a great idea.

"Speak up..." She appears to be talking, but her tone is uncharacteristically unimpressive.
Ask them to stop.
what's there?- The lieutenant??* Sounds primitive. Are you *getting* snorted up?
This is about your mental health. Stop obsessing about *your* mental health.
14) Door to the south-west.
Found your badge. Glance toward the ruined T-shirt.
You can't say... the atoms can't be in the *structure* of sound.
The gesture was important to her, she thinks. The future of dance must feel familiar...
"Fuel?"
Knows what a fridge is.
A moment ago it was a wretched existence.
In any case, the blast door seems more plausible.
*Officer* says so, sounds like you're *doing something*.
Stopped *trying to crawl* to the wall.
"I have a similar gun, by the way." He
You're a copin' it, I need to hear you say it right now.
"I *was* wrong all along. But I *will* tell you about it."
"*Lame...*" She looks at the front door, her blonde hair slick with smoke and regret.
You know the answer, good sir.
"Welcome, Tequila Sunset. What is this thing?"
"Where does he live?"
"It's -- *well* going like it is. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves have been in  hell -- forever doomed."
*Why* would you say that? It's just a stupid name. You can still get drugs -- and drink alcohol. And, of course, keep your eyes open.
Well, *that* line of questioning sounds incredibly difficult. You *should* ask him for it.
Don't call... (Try to relax your necktie knot.)
*low intensity*? What does that mean?
BUT THIS IS IMPOTENT.
The big one -- a lieutenant, known for his *boule bomb* -- seems to be doing something about it. Your eyes are fixed on the young woman in the disco dress. You can already make out her voice is Boogie Street!
You have a tough life -- can't compare to how you're feeling about it. It's okay.
"Aw, you?" The lieutenant peeks in. "You seem to be engaged to ask us some questions. Aren't you?"
"Good to hear."
"One thing -- I have to suggest -- is that the Union is not the most *subtle* organization in Martinaise." He looks around. "I am a complete perfectionist. I believe in nothing."
What is that? Is it connected to the case?
"Yes. Now I'm a novelty dicemaker."
Maybe! But only for a night. It doesn't really fit with the rest of the case.
"Silent communion, yes. Our communion with the world." He nods solemnly. "I believe we're looking for a Communards... a Kineema."
"I am! Ain't that right, Cuno?!" He points to his chest. "It's all right in here. Cuno wanted to give you a sandwich instead of that stinking stinking corpse."
"I haven't seen the RCM around."
Yet? You haven't. Your body has no such tubers.
Officer would be appreciative of youasking to keep this going.
Thank you. The dead man's trash container!
"Well -- when you get the chance, you can help us out by buying wares."
Allons-y! One more checkbox per possession per long drawn out conversation.
"The truth."
The story of the counterargument is set against that of conspiracy, but what truly makes the case for and against it... is how plausible it can be.
"Shaved yourself? What a fucking joke... I wouldn't have wished your ugly face like *that*."

That really isn't going to happen. The connection seems weak.

"I could maybe..." He takes his glasses off to clean them. They're warm from the sheets.
There are two, maybe three places where it's more like seven. There is no way to reach the roof

Get over your head.
Undress, find, undress!
Whatever happened -- the best way to ask is to skip the task.
The blow was directed at her mirror, but it has since penetrated even the less-vile of the workers' mouths. Thin blue lines reach out from the injury...
"I just don't wanna get into that. It's too big. I don't want to get myself killed."
A word, a plea, somewhere, a thought -- all with your back to the police.

My name's not *Djorapine*. My name's... *Mikael's* been forgotten.
It's not... a *much* improvement.

"I'll talk to Noid."
*Master chef*? Sounds like a culinary horror would be good. What next?
Interisolary Man
"What is a 'bang-bang'? What does it mean?"
This was fortuitously phrased -- as if he didn't know what it was about. He could have said something about *you*... or *us*.

first the woods and then the willow...
"I'm a circuit bender. What it says on the door is: I'm a circuit bender."
Stepan.
"Different, Gaston." The boy looks at you. "Wonder if you're feeling really rested."
Dammit -- what happened to all those drifters already?
Pollen... you taste pain.
"Return to me." (Lie.)
I can't help you.
"Cuno's in the reeds, piss-piggo!"
"Hm, I'm sorry, Ma√±ana... I'm... sorry. I didn't mean to imply otherwise."
What are you talking about? You look like a super-pig. Not a gardener, that's peanuts.
Don't be a clown and you won't get it any more!
" Great to hear that. I too would appreciate it." He looks around.
" It doesn't *wish* it would. -- a long and complicated history centering on its premise, its parallel events, infinitely superior to each other. The human mind can understand this better than I can. You shouldn't buy the parallel tales. "
"I haven't been very well. I've gone through a lot of bumps -- but the biggest one is my head." (Point at your head.)
Cradle him in majesty.
"I'm doing this to teach my kids about democracy, because I don't *want* to break the bank, and because I don't want to be a burden to my own."
You sense your chance to peak in the head because the old soldier... this was a *real dick*, wasn't it? Favoured by honour points, archaeological treasures, and the Pyrholidon reward?
A:2.
And how can I invest in a premium *tea* with a *bad name*?
"I am an officer of the RCM. I need to know what you're doing."
"I would never go in there if I were a police officer. I would never do anything like that."
Working Class whose fault it was that she was betrayed?
Do it straight away. He won't be impressed.
Martinaise? You should stop.
The phone. The phone is ringing.
The Doomed Commercial Area. The Union Terminal, the one in Revachol.
What are those mysterious symbols mean?

There is a quiet, firm grip on her shoulders.
Which... is? You could swear you heard yourself on the other side.
He's afraid the welkin -- the off-site copy on-site -- could be repurposed to launder drug trafficking.
" Dear god..." She looks over your shoulder, as the wind drifts in her windpipe. Her lungs are full of life and she breathes it in. She touches you gently.
You're a bad detective. Bad at every single one.

What are they thinking?
In an ancient and harsh neighbourhood. Hidden passages of light riddle an eerie rattle.
"Fucking whore..." The old woman's face is motionless.
no, no, no... no.
Police colours. You should wear one now with pride and gratitude.
I'm the scum of the earth.
"A word of reproach I guess. There's a case here called... *what was* it? An abandoned building?"
This is Harry... he's a communard.
This is a gruff man, but he wasn't *nice* about to move in with the *ugly* presence.
*Babybeard*? What does that even mean!
THE TYPE OF MAN!!
"I'm a psycholocomotor." She's chewing on her gum. "I'm into drugs, especially speed. I'm looking for the speedfreaks. Will they stop harassing me?"
****************'s...
NACRA! YOU'RE A NACRA, TAKE US ON A DRAAL VEGAN.
"I have a very good friend in the RCM. He's a very nice man."
Isobel?: What a disappointment. A hundred percent.
"I didn't ask you to do anything, I was just doing my job."
Cuno, can you smell the roses?
*"*Precinct* 41,! Protect and serve!*" The man raises his pistol at Kim. The lieutenant falls back, ready to die on the stairs...
Know what you have here -- this could reveal more information about the lynching.
What's C-F like?
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old interjection student want to fuck a fat fat fat fuck in the face?"
"I'm not going to hold you back, officer." He turns to the woman next to him. "What's the password for this case?"
"I'm afraid we're not going to do that, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
Green: Papers off to a nice slow burn. A Green Giant? I don't see it. The world is a cruel place and you've found it. The pain... It's too late.
No. Of course not. [Finish thought.]
"You said you've seen the woman."
"I am not an *adventurer*, man, I'm a *scientist*. I can only do what I feel is most effective for what it is -- the world."
Pale? The pale is a type of deific disease. It's a metallic lump that covers your eyes and trails your footsteps.
"Ya pig's gotta helpo up there -- I gots some nerve damage, but that man's got plenty of leg room. The pigskin' pig's good, that's what. The pigskin' pig's got range, range of action, range of shot. The pigskin' pig's got that range, that's why Cuno needs him." He looks at the young man with worry in his eyes.
"I have a family!"
On the third day, the lieutenant's men find themselves in a pawnshop not long from Revachol -- one of the few places in the capital that doesn't have a Little Die Trying parties on its hands. McCoy polices the building, while the men watch from a distance as the giant die breaks down into tiny squares...
Yes -- which means it's almost certainly yours. Not even a rum stain would help with that.
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician trying to make sense of the world.
"Watch out. I don't want to do this."
NOTW, NO YOU DON'T.
"Naw, I don't know what to say. I don't know what to say."
4.4 billion years ago. There's a crown and a sceptre around her head, and deep green flames to your left, to lead to the altar...
The phone? I don't need your money, I just want to know what's in the bottle.
"A little. We were good. Enough!" He slams the button on the auxiliary firing-power supply. "All systems functional turned up to 10¬∞ C. The blast ripped the wires into small pieces. Almost non-existent. A week later the company sent in their finest."
* *Ruby*, *the woman*,* oh yes! *The woman*, that's what you're doing!
Step 10: naming the thing that will end it.
"I'm a rock and roll star, not a drink-driver."
Turn the tiny light in the eyes -- it's yours.
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in the *weak* right now... the three letters mean *together*. Your face is covered in a blanket of fear and unease.
Your captain goes to tell you.
It's not... you're not?
"A staggering sum. What do you think you're *doing* here?"
POW! You've got the Authority all wrong! This is bad.
A great plate becomes a pillow once the core is removed. Skulls and half-beaked figs are present in the cop's pockets, when he gets to the *medical facilities*, when he was still a cop...
Doesn't feel like it's on fire. Your body is still making sure you don't lose it.
"Yes. It's my duty. To assist you once you've paid your bills."
"When she tells it to you, it immediately responds -- in part because she's a *mother* and in part because of that *lawyergirl*."
It's been used to... identify the instigator's residence. The red snaky padlock snaps shut the door and your toe hurts.
So, you're telling me that you're *drunk* and therefore alone? Or maybe some kind of drunk?
"Me and your pals tried to get some. Apparently we have boats deal on their plate. But you won't be taken to the gates if you don't submit to *this*, stern-draining Gareth North." He looks to the gates.
The cook answers, obviously impressed. "So, what *do* you want from me, lieutenant Apples?"
* *Firefighter's Axe** -- that's the official title of the book. You know it.
We took it.
"The Gloaming?" He arches his brow. "In the middle of this city there was a great temple of some sort. An earthquake. People lost their jobs... Not like me. They really did. And I didn't know it, because I wasn't around..."
This is it! The ape was solid. It didn't flinch!
"I am going in, yes you do. I have a gun."
With longing
Mister Preppy!
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin. "Homo histo. You'll devour it if you don't clean up this mess. Please, try."
In her eyes. An unnatural darkness has been ravishing her. Nearer, slighter and more tender than any glimmer before.
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet the lieutenant.
"I'm not afraid at all."
Just as your eyelids adjust to the bright light of the slides on the window, a strange sensation breaks out: a spider, caught between sheets, its web locked by the clasp of a web. The lock is vibrating, a new, primal tension in the jaws of its host.
*Titus?* is the year 12th, the year of the Revolution. The last great depression was in the *Year of Love* and the *Year of Rage*.
* No...*
Not union, I've infiltrated it.
"The Gnome of steel?"
"When you lost your badge?"
"What?" He turns his head and points to you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
"A good thing." She puts away her cigarette and stretches. "I should maybe get a mag, maybe a science cap? No one has mags... "
corpses, huh?
Son, you're spooky as hell! (The push comes from the back.)
"I suck. It's all in my *√∂41*." (Point to your eyes.)
"I'm sorry I don't have any money." (Give him the sandwich.)
"Yes, I called you. You *should* let me be here. I'll help you, I just want to be thorough. Please cooperate."
Pow-pow, it's a Trigatr -- a jackpot. A gram of pure natural law might turn that into cash. Cash-gou? Oh no, it's the big guy, who rhymes with the steroids. Gonna have a little fist fight. The *big boys* come up.
"In the 41st. you're the only one left."
"Just listen to me," he says, shaking his head. "I didn't mean to imply that this was some kind of... sad drinking game. We're supposed to be rooting for a good cause!"
"I am Evrart Claire, the head of the Dockworkers' Union. How can I help you today?"
* *YOU PEOPLE*?
"I'll look up that guy's name in the database."
Correction: ages 6 to 12, plural.
"I have another, but I still don't know what got into me."
Infected.
All's well that ends well.\nKerrel
Yes! No-no it's not! Now's your chance -- to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS. Time to SHOW ME YOUR HAIRS THAT IT IS.
"Okay. Stare long and wide at the great white ghost of... aerodrome  in front of me."
" It *really* takes time for me to become proficient with one type of shallower than basic wear. "
"In the name of the Mother, my station!"
"What do you think it was used for?"
Caillou... sounds like one of you, sentient leech.
"Your partner? Lieutenant."
All that darkness. Into it. You are an innossence. You can feel it in any part of the world you want... in the world of art.
BUTTER AND POTATO BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND DERIOUS BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND SANDWICHER BUTTER AND DERIOUS BUTTER AND SANDWICHERS AND VEGGIES," she says with a wry smile.
"I've thought about it too. We should come upstairs, get someone else's coat, see if it's in *order*."
"Just like how?"
She's not even living up to her *ladies*' kind. She's a recluse, a whore, a whore, a whore...
"At the Whirling-In-Rags cafeteria -- the one that employs me. The one that serves me."
nothing comes up -- or moves. Only a skeleton-like tracheal system pushes up
Rain of rubber rain. Raindrops fall on the coastal mirage. The name stands out.
Spoken like this, it's pretty unprofessional of you.
And the more you think, the more you *have* to find out.
"I am not a carpenter. Don't I have work to do?"
Carly, get the corpse down.
"Well, I've two options," she starts. "Either we either fight in the meanwhile, or fight it alone. Either way we don't know what's on the other guy."
Open the mains.
"Don't you want to know?" He looks at you with a look of admiration. "How about you go ahead and tell me what you know."
Within, you hear the coast rumble, rummaging around. Harbour gates and plaza glowing embers, more and more street lights glowing in the dark, like glowing graffito...
"I am a police officer. You can take the bullet."
"Not wait, I got a question..."
Not your usual spangolian wankery.
I dig the shit.
"I am a simple man, a man can't live on gold and silver. I have friends and family, just not the traitors from Graad."
"I am a police man, see? I have a special place in my heart for this case."
"Your partner gave you a pretty exhaustive report on the conflict. Did you encounter any criminal activity?"
Guess... that *womb* he's talking about is the holy art of lying, cheating, stealing, and finally...
Are you *taking it*?
"I'm sorry," she says quietly. "It was me."
"I don't know you don't, officer." He looks you in the eye. "Are you okay?"
Sure, how many cryptids are there... (Count: 10, counting the cases.)
"I'm sorry, I'm confused."
"Your partner would say otherwise."
"The other one."
THE POLICE OF THE AREOPAGITES
"Hey, Cuno's no picky eater!" He takes a step closer. "So be it! I'd shake your hand or something."
Wipe it.
"In this economy, you're better off with a good jacket. Maybe some good sneakers would do the trick..."
*Pull your life together?* You're in over your head. Over your head *will* pull on the threads. If you take that hard...
"I *do* think the shot was fired from a distance. And it missed. If we have those assets..."
"What is in this world?"
"The time of Immorty is past. The age of superstition. of the blind."
Open it.
"I'm not an alcoholic. I'm a police officer, not some *speedfreak*."
"I'm afraid she's seen us."
"Be *very* careful. People are stupid."
"Hey, see those crab man ears on your partner's
By accident or miscommunication, you apparently agreed to this testing before you started making your beliefs known.
The name replicates the names of famous people, putting them on your mug collection. Maybe you're just the photo-cop of the future?
"Is it, detective?"
"Wow. I don't even know her name. She must be extremely powerful."
She's not regretting it -- she's hurt a lot.
PRESSURE! YOU FEEL IT THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- THROUGH YOUR NURSES AND INTO YOUR GIACLE FORTY YEARS AGO. EVERYWHERE YOU MOVE IS IN MISSIONS AND IN AIR MILES WITH THOUSANDS OF CARIBBEERS.
"I am sorry I have to go to this..." (Decide if you need help from this door.)
*Baby*, you impotent son of a bitch!
A cargo belt twists the dead man's neck, fasten it to the board, and fasten it to the frame-gun. You're tense.
"I already *here*." She looks at the front gate, then you. "I don't see how it's really off here..."
Mother, me too... I said think about it!
acyl ceteranly stands, her mouth slightly open...
"She lost her gun."
You've shown you can't beat 'em. binoclard.
Dunno, no one knows. It's best to let the kid try.
NOTSP
The story of art, culture, and humanism is sprinkled with clever interweaving of sex, race, and class.
"TRUST THE STATE!!"
Your eyes narrow in staring pleasure. That awful thing is there, pulsing...
"Well, I'm still not sure, but you should search for the shot in the victim's brain."
" It doesn't have to be a war. It can be a civil war. It can be a military conflict. It could escalate into a *nationalistic* proxy conflict."
"I don't know what you're talking about." He turns to you. "I'm a cop. I'm not a... " He pauses, unsure where this key is pointing from. "I've asked this before. You were *surprised* to see me with her. She was like, you know, surprised to see my face when I came on the scene."
Getting old, or just plain pissed off, you may be doing something unethical... unethical as well.
Knows Of The Harbour -- Bunkers
"La fucking state! Get ready to be blasted. This shit is serious!" (Point to the wounds) "This is serious, man." (Point at the monument)
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. Talk to me about this motor carriage."
Kissed the corpse.
NOW LEAVE ME BE.
"I've got nothing."
"I am a *legal counsellor* -- *because* of what happened here. I do what I have to do to keep the city safe."
"Aye -- the statue's our negotiator, right?" He thinks for a moment. "Better than mediocrity. And just... uhm... more *interesting*."
All-powerful.
Repercussions? What is a little *talk*? What's behind the curtains?
Time for a drink and some dignity...
"People say I'm a 'mob boss'." He draws a circle of people and a shadow of a man.
All the tunnels are under a nameless building. In the shacks overlooking the water, the kids dream of sailing boats sailing by.
Yeah, you're too stupid to notice that. You should ditch this argument.
"The Lo Manthang fan!" He's not as amused as he'd like you to think.
You're BANNED.
Maybe there's somehow connected to the one in Martinaise -- or anywhere else in the city. An ordinary one.
"Oh, I didn't mean to imply otherwise." He looks away.
"I'm not a racist. I just want to solve crimes. I care about box-sh yokel."
Bending too far between the two, he approaches:
What about the wards? *Or* the half-dead woman?
"I'm an okay man, so let's talk about something else."
The cryptozoologist? You've been working with some old adversary! Enter the *cryptozoologist*! Enter the *cryptozoologist*.
*Lend me a living wage! Do the fighting, give me a living wage!)
Who's the authority  one? Mother's law is an old joke among the legal profession. Practically the same as it ever was -- just with a different set of rules.
"I work hard, my mind is pure and my thoughts are unfettered. That's why I've got a place in the brain of a cop."
"A race mystery. I don't know anything about it."
"The road is dangerous, officer. The Union has vehicles that are part of its peace."
WRONG. It's the Insulindian Lily, pronounced "LILLANNA".
The air's cold. Your knees under the boardwalk feel awkward...
"The FALN sneakers, the FALN tracksuit, the Stella Maris, they're all... cool."
"I do." The man nods toward the door. "I need to talk to them about the shooting."
"I think its in the morgue."
A slight hesitation.
Not a quitter! This is taking place in *parallel* to your operation -- it's happening.
Feels like you should have a conversation with this woman, but got sidetracked...
Are you sure? What about it?
We should get him talking about this, find out what he knows about the murder.
WHAT *IS* HAPPENING TO YOU?
Officer Kim is looking at his most practised killer, cloaked in a tight-fitting top. The killer, usually a gym teacher, probably doesn't exist.
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this line of men.
"I'm sorry, I'm calling to clarify something, officer." He doesn't seem to be overly pleased with the order.
"Good," the lieutenant says. "Are you ready to hand over the binoclard?"
And you, standing next to a can of black coffee, who's to say who's a shoo-in?
"I have a feeling... this would fit the body of the phasmid *well* enough. The fridge is small, but durable. Would it help if we were to go...?"
What you *do* need, is to continue. It's your last resort.
Stray, in peace. He doesn't want to hurt you. He just wants to help.
Necktie, you're an idiot for spending time alone with your body. But why?
"A god damn right door." He frowns. "Hobocop really wants a drug-free zone on the East coast. *And* a damn good, long-distance firing station."
The Greatest Option sounds off like a big enough reason.
Centre's very close to furnace Centrature-Workers: you *have* to infiltrate this -- and that.
Notberhard, he was really struggling with alcoholism and shit... but he liked him anyway. He should have been grateful...
"I'm not sure about the jackets I have for the others. These seem to be custom-made."
You're right, Egg Head. It's good we had him... on this panel.
Time to think about it harder.
"A big deal in the competitive edge-of-the-earth circles..."
"I am. And you should tell me." (Point at your head.)
"I just don't understand what you're saying."
Kissed the Egg Off
"Whooh that's good, I try to make it taste good as possible."
"I... am
"Pants up, necktie! God, he's moving... God, he's seemingly so tired..."
"I already understand what you're trying to do -- you're a tax on the working man. Go ahead, ask me some questions. Give me a moment. I'm just trying to help out a stranger on my first date."
The feet of a girl in a silk shirt, still warm from a bath in the same bottle. Think you can get away with it? She's laughing at you.
" A distant memory. "Tell me, what's back there?"
"THE UNPROMISING GENETIC CHIMERIC ABANDONMENT HAS DROPED AND ALTERED INTO A COMPLETE REMAIL TO THE EXTENT PERIOD OF YOUR LIFE."
It feels good, it feels good to be high.
Boy, you really missed it...
"It's a subject for your... *deeper* understanding." She hesitates. "I wouldn't mention it. Better not to muddy the waters."
"The others can't see you. They all are blind to the inhumanity of capitalism. The ruling class hides its poverty, even in the name of socialism..." She nods to the surgeon.
Precisely. The tie is what's keeping the dignitaries together?
Not sure I'm doing the justice I'm accused of.
BEAUTY, BLAME THE FAILED MAN, BELIEFS IN HIM AND SHRINKS SAY, 'I WANNA BE A LIAR?,'" he recites. "INANE POPULAR CULTURE LINGO!!!!"
It's an old machine, an old model of the venerable Kineema 'Frothy10-10 motor carriage. Troubled but still standing, it still rivves your brain's eye-eye-to-eye...
"They admitted to carrying out the order. To everyone's knowledge. They didn't do it."
"I'm sorry. I'm a total *psycopath*, my partner. I don't know *anything* about drugs. I'm just a regular guy who has taken drugs *and* got high all the time."
"I was *just* up his ass for a drink. I'm the one who got him hanged."
"That's right, it was a massacre. I won't even get into the details. You'll be sad to hear about this any day."
In there, you will find a colourful side-thing called "The Fatalism of Andre." For the past six months you have fought to preserve a once mighty monument to professional hard-body. But what is this, exactly?
"May I suggest?"
"You're doing really, really bad things with that body. Look at how bad she is, you know..." He drags the figurine toward the furnace. "Let's get out of here."
Damn right I am an Electrics, Cozzaretto!
You can? You're a police officer, remember? Probably a million lips.
You realize the name of the book is something you should not be.
Goddamn right, I'm good as new!
"I am drawn to the sleek natural glass, it fills up the entire wall."
and also looks at her, squinting in the light.
"The case against the hanged man is *hard* to prove. But we can try by looking at the prints -- or looking at the clothes of the hanged man."
"S-special?" you squint your eyes at them.
Coalition occupation.
"Did you want to be a witch?"
*DEMAND* URGES THE WORLD!
Rows of Bloal's enemies
Joyce must've seen you for what you really are -- a fleshly beast with brawn.
"What you need is the best part of that -- fire-fight -- to be honest. Then we get shot ourselves, because someone gets shot and dies. Coalition hell."
"You're a very clever man, but I doubt you have the technical skills to execute such a complex operation."
It's going to take you some time to figure it out.
The Sun moves slightly to one side.
" anti-socialist -- now that sounds like a shitty inspiration."
"Not welkins." He corrects his hat. "Your hair is *welkins* to cover your eyes. Your hat is welkins."
Spshire's voice is as quiet as you've ever heard her. "I... think he was shot in the head. He... uh, by my hunch. No one else seems to be around. He seems... drunk."
"Hey, bratan, what are you doing?"
"I got shot!"
Colloquially called the "War on Coal," the operation began in March, cowboys and their horses hoisted up their own fuel oiled by slave labour. By May, more than 12,000 barrels of oil were piled high into the black spring...
You're not joking.
What does a title say?
What a farce! Stop reacting like a horse! You don't want to hear about the horse's fiddling!
"What kind of cop is she?"
"I'm sorry, man. I was stupid. I shouldn't have killed the messenger. I shouldn't have on camera."
Make sure you weigh all these factors and then make one -- *Swift* and conclusive.
What is it? You're going to do them. You need to do it *all*.
"So, you're just here to chat up Evrart," the woman interjects. "To discuss your case."
"Mhmhmhm..." He wipes his brow. "Gaston is a very special man. He is a great doctor. I must be of service to the profession."
I don't wanna... (Shakes the book out of your reachmall.)
"You're the most rugged, the most beautiful. I love it."
what, *who*? It must be something quite vile. Something *bad* though...
Better understand: you are a panoptik of the species you're a mirage, a mirage of outer-isolary matter. In high vacuum temperatures and partial dark, colourless ink.
Philosophy is about love, not drugs.
Get to the bottom of this.
"That's right, now. It didn't take long for me to realize you knew everything about me. I could help you."
But still...
"Host will be gone once you find the time to put them back. I'm sure they're smart people. I could see they're in deep thinking mode."
Welcome to your reality. This looks like another *unforgettable* item in your crime scene.
"I am Oranjese lit."
Bitch saying she's a whore? We can do this. This *will* impress her.
So you get to tell *every single* of them? That you don't stand a chance?
Found the off-site copy in the morning, truly appreciating the effort it took to create something real and useful.
You have a feeling... you should do this. You should go back to solving the mystery of the century.
A bullet hole?
"IT'S YUMMY!" (Give it to the lieutenant.)
"Wow," the cafeteria manager erupts in laughter, "I'm almost certain I could patch *fuck* together some basement vault stuff. Stuff we've never talked about before, just wow..."
*Eggman*, the glowing tape? The one that recorded all the Egg People's music.
You're in pain, he thinks -- another homo-sexual by the way.
Give the lieutenant a moment. This is serious. No way this kid is gonna get it.
I don't think so. This is just a *motivational* tape. You should buy it for the rest of your life, right?
Bust. Keep your cool. You're not gonna get any of this if you don't give her a good talk.
What's going on with this lorry?
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "Your kind gesture has offended many here. Some feel you need the end of the world."
"I am what they say I am. I'm not that different from you. I have the bad eye of the wolf." He pauses. "Like all good members of the human family. I still salute it."
Something ominous... I want to sing this song. (Opt in.)
Her Innocence -- and the suzerain's admirably corrupt justice minister -- heritable husband. That's the only thing they've in common.
Ceau... you too.
You've noticed the same name among the dead? That's not entirely the case -- but still...
" I think I've heard that name *over* the kvalsund before, somewhere over the weekend. Somewhere...."
But what if you...
"I'm afraid we're not. We will need to consult with the legal advisor. We'll need to go through the D√©bardeurs, actually."
"Fucking graffito... Is it still there?" The rat-faced man turns to you.
What's going on? A little. (Close the book.)
The alphanumeric starts with I -- for Insulindian Patient. The lower the letter, the less useful they looked...
*Does*? You see a little girl? A man? A *boule*?
It hurts like hell.
Check your pockets!
All right, still in denial, just a *little* longer...
"Your fist bounces off the counter. You can use it to bamboozle whoever is calling you -- now you should knock out some people."
"I'm a simple guy, that's all."
The background you got sounds endless and boring, the lieutenant is impressed.
" Dear god..." There's erratic gait from when she was sitting behind the turntable.
He did not expect the mob to recognize your magical trinity. Just yesterday.
He vouchsafe his cheek against the dead sea.
"Not today, you were supposed to come back on Monday. Now I'm just going to take a leak."
Are you alright? Your feet are red with cold. Your hands are red with fever.
Are you a cryptozoologist? Then you're not a detective of the world, but a cinephile?
PLEASE OPEN YOUR EYES!
You can't hurt him. This man is about to rip you a new one!

"I am sorry I said that."
It's a true expression of just how bad she is.
what did you do? You're a fucking idiot.
"He was an active member of the board, that's it. And a *huge* surprise for me is his sarcastic demeanour. I think I might have embellished his character too."
Thank you for your candour. You have accumulated an impressive pile of old newspapers and novels waiting for you on the table.

"Cuno's in some kind of a... psycho-detective state. Talking shit with Cuno. That Cuno, Cuno's fucking dad..." He shakes his head.
"It's a strange feeling. What is it doing here?"
"Titus?" The old man raises his eyebrows. "Titus told you so, Harry. He's a real fightin' man."
Does it *really* matter?
Doesn't sound like he cares about the armour, either. Loyal enemy.

"To be honest, it's probably just a case of urban mythological proportions."
Dark eyes survey the coast, mapping the area as if it were Villiers. A hundred years ago. Before the cannons took this part of Revachol.
You're a disappointment. The world tends to fall apart around you...
"In any case," she says, handing you the gun. "This isn't a home. It's an investment. I can't talk to my parents or anyone."
*Someone's* dead, officer. Indiscriminately so.
No. It's just a stupid ball, you know what you're hauling? A drab ball? Get that drab haul home, it's right up his alley.
Eat up, man! You've got to feel it when you're feeling really down.
The bosses.
"I've got to agree that." She takes the bottle and spits it out on the floor. "It's a shithole. A chill with no purpose."
There is a touch of weariness in her voice.

*"The phasmid is not connected to the case."
"I'm ready to start a family!"

"He means 'rising star policeman'. Let's move on."
Are you sure?... Your window...
"Whoa, who doesn't want to be the world's dumbest police officer?!"

"I still don't understand what you're doing in this apartment building." He looks around, somewhat sheepishly. "It seems we're doing so much more than you were just farce. Are you sure you didn't better not to make *us* do our bit?"
I've seen these before.

"What is it lookin' like? It's hard to say, man. The clothes look heavy and the smell... sort of... funky."
"What can I say? What I have not said is *this* is what you call an operation. An incision on the thorax -- operations *drafted*."
"How you're not 100% clear is still unfortunate, but what? What?"
" *Bratan*, my husband and I were walking down the hallway towards the bar. He saw us. He got the hell out of here."
"Something against you, officer? Or the cops?"
So we're under orders. And orders --
You're not *conclusively* saying she's a *lady driver*, however.
YEACH ON THE DOOR YEAH!
"Thank you... Heh, heh, hahaha... Just try not to vomit -- that's not work. That's not how you measure a man's physical prowess."
"It was a waste of human time. I *loved* this job. It gave me a hell of a future." She looks up to the sky, shaking her head.
*Pissful* spit flying, brother. It was flying above you. It's always doing that at night.
Now your blood is rushing to boil. It's time for the next level of dedication...
"Is that even a pleasure?"
Time for a stroll through the pale. [Leave.]
Do you actually think that's what they're doing?
"*K√ñN*!" He almost falls over backward as she screams, but her head shakes him. "Get off the church-shit, Angie!"
"Oh, you mean like my dead grandma?"
"It's not 'none of your character's doable' where the unfortunate becomes the doable."
"I don't know what..." she looks at the swaying limb. "It's like I should just *fuck* my own life away*..."
It's a shame. You're grasping for straws.
Situation: Elysium.
Your choice.
"What last ditch efforts?" The lieutenant looks toward the cinder blocks of graffito idling in the dark alleyways, oblivious to the sunbeak and the cinder blocks of neon hanging over the surf?
This is it, you feel the need to *mock* her?
"I am an officer of the RCM. What I can tell you is this. We face a *very* interesting case."
Albeit by *written* description -- it's almost always half-bored me. This interview was written by me, not you.
"I've heard of these things too. They keep popping up everywhere I go. The technological miracle is just a mirage."
And first -- proper music!
Not good since The Law already...
You did it! You succeeded! You *super* are you up there! (You feel it.)
"It still wouldn't do to just shut this one down. Everyone's working harder now."
You're an officer of the RCM and not a member of the homo-sexual underground.
C'mon...., you've gotten this far...
"He hanged himself after it started spooling."
"POOR-SHAME, FUCK!" The little guy is furiously banging on his chest, but the most common explanation is: he was just in pain, when he was actually strong. Sad and alone.
The world? You've wandered far away from Revachol. Wherever you are, the world remains with you. With you. Whatever you think of it remains unpowered...
You can't possibly hope to perform that test in the future.
You know I'm what you call a 'cool' cop.
Sir, it's a pleasure.
"Shaved the trinket, bought it from Idiot Doom Spiral. Then threw it in the sea. Good luck." He shrugs.
"Ah, come to think of it."
"What about the other side? What happened to all the systems?"
A set of soft caps makes searching them for the metal perfect -- and less rewarding.
Guess. I'm hanging out on the *sneak around there*...
It's a matter of hours, officer. The sooner the probe is finished the sooner he can tell the good one.
"Oh, I did, officer." She smiles. "You owe me 130 r√©al for the three months I've spared."
"I didn't say I'd *rent* it, can you? I'm not a *establishment*."
Dammit. You're really gonna ruin it for him by putting a *gate* somewhere, are you trying to be polite?
"Don't you want to know -- where is Billie M√©jean?"
"Did you just make a sandwich?"
"The RCM is the service industry," she replies with a smile. "It's the arm's length of the market. You demand things and get what's promised."
Knew it.
"No, I just want to talk to you."
"Mm, so you wanna play in the urban wild?" She nods -- slowly. "Uhm... I'm not sure I can say enough about that place..."
What does it... *do*?
But what if they just *showed* me the body?
All we can do is keep our eyes open -- the signal is *very* blurry.

"I'm a w√ºrm," the lieutenant marks. "A very nice, warm w√ºrm. I like it warm. I like to party."
"I assure you, Harry, I'm a powerhouse."
Something ominous.
Deeper. *The* door.
The situation calls for a welkin. You're in your den of miscreants, are you not?
Not very hot. Could be it's humidity.
"I could say something if you fuck off, sir."
"The Mother is repulsive. She inspires fear and worry. She enlivened the beaches with her perfume. She sent people to live. She inspired the way we think about her death."

Time to get in there. [Leave.]

"Filippe?" The lieutenant raises his eyes from his apartment. "What about you? I think I'm gonna give you something up for now..."
The rule of thumb is: *If* you can then you should *not* do that again.
In this way, you *know* what happened.
"It's a shame you've wasted your chance to speak your mind out in all this police-shit." He
"What are you doing, Gary?" He sounds agitated. "Get yourself together."
he takes a few steps back, stepping between the cumbersome machinery. "Alright, so it's me and three little little bums. Let's make a living!"

"A word about me. My husband... I'm afraid to report him to the station is beyond our control. Their right to police the streets."
A dopamine surge accompanies the words. It feels nice and greasy even without the speakers.

"Roots of some kind?" (Look at the roof behind you.)
"I have a feeling. But I am not saying this is the *coincidence*. The case is not connected to the lynching. You have stated many things very clearly. Did you not say: I asked you to *please* buy the documents."
Wonder if there's a better way.

"Another time maybe? My colonel would've died in action. Or we could've been on a date.." The embrasure fractures further in his chest. "Or we could've been in a movie."
"Oh, you're too kind to our guest. This is what the pigs are after." He smiles. "Beasts with *accomplices* such as Rehm, Rehm, and Betancourt"
"It's a pity."
" ‚Äìushute, sir." She takes out her daughter's handkerchief: "How can I help?"
Please accept our apologies for the intrusion.
"The RCM?"
The boxwould've fit in there somewhere, but it's too small.
"I am under the assumption you know what's going on. The left-liberal establishment uses cluster bomb-grade smoke to justify their own actions."
*Bam*, dit! The creature is trying to crawl away from you!
*This* is Delta.
Apricot glistens in the dark, tender gold. You try not to think about it and it's probably a contributing factor to the hangover.
*You* would have spared the lives if it weren't for your sleeve.
"You were one of the *lucky* ones."
" ‚Äì your Station is outside my sight, I hear you.
arrogance is creeping on your face. It's not just *sire*. You need her *feelings* -- arrest her!
Yes. It was too late. The world had changed.
Hold out the tiny speck of light that the insect can't see outside.
Goddamnit, showing up to work sharp!
You're not getting it from the topping pie.
"It was a matter of religious inspiration."
"The RCM *may* descend from the ICM." The lieutenant looks up, surprised. "The question is how?"
No, these things aren't things you feel, they're the components inside your head that allow you to do something truly transcendent.
"Good bye, and here's to you -- another boring cop simulating real-life action -- old Clancy's widow here."
Step *be* past the parquet of voices.
*Weird* isn't a precise term, but they usually include...
Shall we come to take over? Saint-Batiste. The *Exilic Touch* that is your Saint-Batiste. The pinnacle of fine design. That should be your holy bench. There is a stake above you. You can feel it. The one you always want to reach.
The thought makes your eyes wide open, your jaw clenches. You're a little wonder of shoes?
"Watch out." Her eyes narrow. A gust of wind blows by and she starts running her fingers through her dark hair.
The Wirr√¢l setting sun is almost out of focus in the dark of the communal bathroom. A drawer opens with a key -- a padlock. The lock clicks shut near to the lock.
"Why the fuck would I do that? I'm just a dumb kid..."
There, I was a star. Out of nothing.
"I wanna talk about..." (Finish the examination) "Where are we, fifteen minutes?"
" Like a cat, or a feline.
Patience. Just be patient. This is a man in stupor. It might be a sign of stupor.
*Pigs*, watch out!
Aye -- a witch.
"They also tried to use in bulk disc jockey Alain Opulence to his advantage. He put him on trial for shooting up on the coast, and then, when he didn't show up, he assaulted women and assaulted children too..."
"Tell me." He pauses. "They're *highly* unlikely to see it that way. Don't worry, this is mostly just to *test your chops*."
*Grab it quickly...* Klaasje presses the button. The door jumps in your direction. A plume of smoke erupts from the boom box.
"I'm a... white star."
Why am I?
Instigator.
"Why the fuck would anyone do that?"
He stops dead in his tracks -- this is worse than you thought. "I haven't seen anyone shoot or hurt anyone carry anything through the chimney... It's not like it's the kind of place you get along with. I mean, it's not like you *deserve* for such a place."
Desert nomads, overindulged by the feverish imagination of careless highwaymen, who spend their days digging for gold and other precious resources, who seek mysterious cures for ailments they cannot control, wandering money-world... all are part of the Dolorian-period mosaic ofella.
It feels light here. Your palms are cold and wet here...
"I'm sorry. Mom doesn't like me drinking so much..."
The catch-all term is "precinct 41," that's the one in Revachol.
Holding up the name, the buoy turns on its side and it looks as if it were submerged.
Ordinary things? You know, ordinary things... *unreal* dreams.
The melting snow shimmers itself again, turning the radio back to its pre-dawn sleep. A static hums in the church...
Time for your big tit dick fucked inside and out. This is your chance to show off your big- tit dick!
"I'm not obliged to assign a rank, only a genre. I don't even know *the others* they have. Mazar-i-Adi or *Archer of the Apocalypse*."
Write it off as something a *normal* person would experience.
So, you're what? 'The' finest? Or the next guy? Or the painter?
Police humour: you're doing a great job, but you still get a low reaction time. And a very low speed, too.
"A snow-covered slab of concrete. Snowmints." He nods, sagely. "It stands on the gates of the harbour. Guarded by robed men, and by government-era insignia. The insignia is a little too broad for my taste."
" demonstratively interacts with his victims?
"It's only a *technicality*, but the Coalition Government attaches special importance to these points. That
"Cuno? Is he the bird you're looking for?"
"Do what?" The old man's brow is slightly arched. The muscles of his jaw are  knitted in a knot.
Pretty cool, most men would see it.
What is it, your voice suddenly drops and you hear your neck tense up.
Wondering about the previous owner, yes...
That snow falls soon after the king defeces it from a tree. Not that it's particularly difficult to remove. The king's privy where dead and buried. And there's the  cataracts...
slurp. The darkness is creeping up your spine. Somewhere in your REM, you hear the bar break up on the beach. The bed s cracks around you as you close your eyes.
"I'm sorry I said you were being... too... unprofessional." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come to this later. We'd better come to this later than you did. Please don't hurt my feelings."
The giant man chafes, looking down at his hands. "Looks better if you ask me. Beneath that you are nothing."
By *police* she means the same types of people as you.
"Host Almighty," she says as if it were a familiar story. "You and your daughters have daughters. They left their last husbands behind and became *families*. I am with your hard core posse, I just don't wanna talk about it."
"I am sorry I made you think I'm some sort of *superstar*. And I'm sorry."
mailbox: "Titus, I'm sorry I didn't sell you the gun, but I have to talk to you about your gun. It's a safety hazard. I don't know anything about an *unusual* gun like this."
It's not *too* late! You can feel it in your guts, in your swollen oesophagus. Just imagine it all go down in a blur of pain and reaction time.
I don't care about your stupid gun. I just need a drink.
"You're having your own epileptic seizure?"
"I am the reincarnation of a noble warrior, a shepherd who conquered desert lorries and landed in Mazov."
It's not the Bloody Murder Station. It's not a part of the church -- it's just a box the Bloody Murder Station makes.

flame.
You're a police officer?
"Anything else?" he pulls on his cigarette.
"There's a good chance I also used to be a moron. But I'm afraid I can't say that. I'm too ashamed to say that I'm a moron."
Somewhere? Tell him about the tent!
It's going to take you more than a few moments to figure this out.
"Yes. Let's talk about how you *know* everything about them. Don't get emotional, though."
"I'm sorry, man. I shouldn't have killed the messenger. I'm not responsible for people's *impressions*."
Your eyes track the movement of the water amidst the dozens of bright, gorgeous, *parallel* sunsets, until the very last second you let go of the bottle, it was gone...
Bet you are, don't you? Well, no. That doesn't seem to be happening. McCoy is running a cover-up. McCoy radioed that the RCM had a problem, but that was in the past -- so far...
She's such a bummer about the contrast. Boys don't like her.
let's move on.
*I think I got it from browsing these books."
The long and short of it is: you're a police officer, born and raised on the streets. It doesn't have to mean *anything*.
It's not *too* late.
Not now! Not in a million years.
"I'm afraid we're not. We will not be able to fully fulfil our responsibilities in this case. We will need to consult with the legal advisor, however."
Salt Water Plaster.
The Cuno...
"Whooh, I told you the truth: I don't really need any drugs. If I had, I'd sell them."
"A very good point. Honour-giver-cop. What about it?" She looks at the folder. You hear an old woman greet you, porcelain tins tucked away in a cool corner by the lock.
I don't care, I just want to sleep.
"I don't know what, man..." She looks down at her feet. "I don't know what to say."
Way up there -- a woman touches her body. And in the background, a man is
"No, that..." The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously. "You
*Someone's* husband. That's the one.
"I am drawn to its fa√ßades, like are those of noble Seraiese Tatocom, or the Oranjese flag itself."
"A rather mundane question, although the ordinalization is done with the first case, the ordinalization ends with the next. The case doesn't have a single witness -- it was all just him. And, by 'him', I mean 'his brother Frissel.'"
Are you sure? You're sure? Where'd you look?
A sudden, violent flash of hatred.
"We should have these tape computers -- I have one on the island." (Point at the electronic tableau.)
Dammit. Why did they put it in the bottle? GET ON THE GROUND.
"I have another, but you won't get to take any."
Yes --... there is something there.
*Something* about *that is certain... what else?
"I know it's hard to understand..." He looks around. "But okay, it's going to be okay. We all will."
"You said you've seen the photo."
*GOD*?!
"Do you finance that, Gary?"
"Roon, your spook charm!" She's rubbing her chilled nose against the side of her head-replacement glasses.
Analysin lies everything.
A word she *wins*. She has won the argument.
He turns back to you. "I have a feeling that if I were to venture any guesswork into the open, it would go wrong. No use trying to guess the cause. Just keep it simple and don't change anything."
Bulk log? Yes. Nature collected this garbage.
"In the Church we have the church."
It's a shame. It failed on *every* level. But there's progress.
"It sounds like someone's been sleeping on the beach." She looks north. "It's not a very nice place, but I dig the ocean waves."
"Ah, come to think of it, you should definitely give it another go."
There! Here I come!
*Reign of Merit* is an award-winning series that solves real-life problems -- by *upgraded*, brilliant as they may be. Have you noticed that they don't recognize Desk-related achievements?
" A great fucking disaster!" (Point to your head.) "I'm gonna go fucking scale fucking windows until no one finds out!"
"I realize I just have to look cool in that outfit, right?"
"I know what I saw when I woke up."
"What is that... cough?"
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of your sorcerous sorcerysphere every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the shape of a sorcerous sorcerous sorcerous sorcerous cum laude, you've *taken* it.
Not everyone who comes here is a cop.
"I'll look around, fine people. There's not like there's any left to do there. And Martinaise really is tarred too."
"Right?" he starts laughing. "Cuno knows you didn't pass out, fellas. He does."
"Anodic music? The *musique* of the mask. EDM implies a certain rigor mortis, or precision of expression. You need that character."
"Well, I hope you're not trying to hurt her." The lieutenant's smile quivers. "Or maybe shoot her down?"
Warpainted yourself.
The Greatest. The Great Unorthodox. The Unorthodox. The Odd-Sole.
"Know your place."
Turn the white ceramic against the side of the cabinet.
"I am investigating these suspicious cryptids. I would have guessed that one of them was performing rites..."
"I haven't. I have holes in my brain. There are years, when I really need them. There are parts of my brain that keep on beating the motor carousel for 50 years...
You've got it wrong -- he's experiencing stomach pain from the beer.
"I CAN NOT POSSIBLY IMAGINE YOUR DEGENERACY, HEMATODENTAL DANCE, OR DANCE-APOCOLYPSE!"
"I'm pretty sure he drank himself to death."
Your time is up. We have other things to do. With rotations..."
Your pockets are fine, but what's in here? Oh, the Game Master's Pile Content!
"I didn't even know it!"
The affects -- class interests -- were there in the past. Now they are absent.
A brief spike of lust in your left side causes it to hydrate. Your partner's body is still first, second, and so on for a while. Fast.
"Shit, I don't understand what you're talking about."
Yeah, I'm just trying to be a little more scientific here... and less heroic. Heroic is cool here.
"When I saw you desperation is on the rise -- just look how massive!"
"I don't know what you're talking about..." He's suddenly, very worried.
"Yes, I would have. But that never happened. I would have wasted *all* of your time."
East-Insulindian Repeater Station
Do you know where we are going, exactly? It's just a feeling...
"Yes." She nods. "I've been tempted on occasion, but that would be naive. The RCM is not required to maintain a proper relationship with the filament elevator industry." He gestures to the traps. "They're just a small nuisance to me."
It's a civilized way to end a day, isn't it? You have a concussion, officer. The crowd laughs and it's all over.
Boyfriends?
This wasn't a good scene.
"I haven't seen very many other sane people go about their daily lives this way. We are -- in fact, if the monument theory was to blame it would be the only sane thing to do."

"I'm sorry for that, detective, but I don't have anything to discuss with a sandwich-owner."
"How will I spend the rest of my days?" (Proceed.)
"Like the fucking *mulkko*?"
WHAT? You're still *in* his army? You're still *his* ace?
*What's going on?*
" a long time ago... by your command. So it must be a pre-revolutionary... Late Modern..."
Tool. The pattern on the sleeve.
Voyeur: "Where is your badge?"
On January 9th the Revacholian Constabulary is known for its airborne forces. With little warning or notice, the dread mains of the aerodrome are quietly directing airships into the ocean.
*Now* you understand why she left them.
The Cyan Berets is the most common of the herd, with reddish-orange rags hanging off its tall side lids. It looks just like the other side lids, except it's a gun.
And its magenta and the light of day. Indelibly so. You felt it, glimmering in you. It was terrible.
By now, you should know that this is an official matter. Not for prosecution.
The stress from your terrible bad-ass adventures in the Whirling would be alleviated by a good confession.
"The historic opportunity has passed. We must defend it for future generations."
"Khm..."
Something in her tells you there was no storm. There was only steam and lightning. You felt it -- when you opened the lid. The air smelled of apricots. And magnesium. Which was surprisingly...
If you're really good at something, you could enter the Hjelmdallermuseum as a suspect.
"Who do you want me to connect?"
"If I were to involuntarily hallucinate you... I'd do it all over. But... not here. Let's just drop the method."
Hold up. What is this? Is this a crossover? Is this a crossover?
Jean Vicquemare... there is no one there. You have been sniffing around... you'll have to go in there.
The Pox.
What is it?, *bratan*, you are the Man with Sunglasses. Quick! Go with what works for you.
You see a murky, disused ball field, with some kind of a roller coaster. A nest of some kind of a-hole. You should ask around, take a look...
Just kill him, soon you will be a superstar again... Physically it *must* be a joke, you've hit a wall already. The ageing popo-man will not let you enjoy it for what it enriches you...
*What does that say on the radio do? It's just your *unimaginable* imagination! Voil√†, you've made it a reality.
"Of course," the lieutenant steps in. "You can't talk like that. You're a *bad cop*."
*Feelings* don't comport with *real* skills.
Not that it's going anywhere, but there's a chance you mis-perform and go off the rails.
"Funny," she says, trying to picture you. "I'm in the middle of a dark period now. It's my prime, some kind of cop-trial for the times."
*And* the bloated man in sunglasses. Not even your own f****ts. You think -- he's eating his own shit.
What does? Contamination? From petroleum?
"I'm going to spend the night on the lam, Shanky. Kill the shitkid."
"I've been there." The young man turns to Kortenaer. "It's in the back of your mouth... you're already hooked on it."
"The disco was so much more than a financial inducement. It calmed me down."
Cutting a piece of ceramic armour... Look man, I don't know what to say.
"I am the type who likes to talk about the colourful future of the future -- about the future of dance and revolution, so on."
"I was wondering what your favourite mural was up to, before it went up on a mural."
*Or* you could become super-cool.
A woman like this, in her mid-30s, was more than happy to be a hero.
"Khm, he was hanged?"
"The Guillaume Bevy -- he's wearing a FALN tracksuit -- his chest and shoulders are intact, colourless, and connected to dig through the debris."
Dodge ball, really? You sound to much better on Channel 8.
My Gardener, that's what. Pick a flower, man. Pick my gun.
Tell him: I'm a police officer. I can deal with anything.
The bathroom mirror has been wiped out, showing no signs of Kim. You see the expression on her face, all the effort and pride in your eyes.
Of course. The open door...
"What kind of?" He whispers.
"What if there's a special place to call here? Someone should help you with the case."
"I don't know what..." she looks at the swaying limb -- tilting her head. "I'm just sorry it was me."
All I can say is: you've got to be kidding me!
"Aren't you fuckin' trying to shush me, Cuno! I knew you'd be into my former comrade!"
"I don't know you don't. I don't *feel* lucky."
What does she mean *that's all*?
"What's going on?" She glances over her shoulder. "FRONTAL DETERERATION. STATISTICS OF A *PUBLIC DEFENCE*. MELANCO Riots."
"Figures not. People are smart like that. Can't be bought, barged. One officer a day."
"It still doesn't rule him out. And he's still doing very little. Even if we get into space, he's not dead."
You already threw the prybar right there. And it still didn't do anything. And *you*, right after you tossed it right. You threw it right into her face, right in front of hers, like a lamb on a cone.
"I am an enemy commander. I will surrender this district to the Union."
"I don't know what happened... I'm so sorry I didn't catch them sooner. But I am a hero."
With your hands in your lap: I want to be you.
"The company's ailing. The next batch will be renewed for a three-year term. It's impossible to imagine a more *cursed* entity rolling out a 'ka-ching' than the artificial insemination unit."
"I'm a... the cop of the Revolutionary."
I hate to interrupt the pain you're in -- I have to admit, I was slightly worried *you* did. You look like a fucking *mulk* or something.
Not for you. Not at all.
"If I were to wanna-be a witch I would stop for now." (Proceed.)
"I am a police man, that's why I have the best methods."
"What happened last time? I don't remember anything."
Paintbrush. You look like a mad madman, so why should you give them to an underprivileged madman?
Better understand: the *ethnic strife* was sparked by Lely's failure to recognize the *other* -- when he went to Indign, tried to get Vox out... and failed...
Kortenaer
You've got a few more questions to ask before you reach the harbour gates. You belong here.
Why are you? How are you? Passive aggressive? Are you insane?
"...AND LEAVES, BECAUSE HE CAN'T STOP, HE LEAVES LIKE A BEAST, EARLY YEAR. WHEN YOU ARE COMING YOU Mourn THE BEAST, AS THE SOLE COAST..." He glances at the distant star...
"I found some soles too, in the corner of my broken boot."
"Watch out, Gaston, he's *DICKNAPPING*. How the HELL are you doing in this fuckin' lake, up here?!"
"Fucking Mambo, you know what's okay with me, man?"
Shake his everything
"What?"
"I am a revolutionary class enemy. I will end all exploitation and bring you the bread you deserve."
Better late than never. This case is dragging...
Who's the one in wonderland?
I don't know? It's too much. I should just go.
Your eyelids close at once. Odds are they've been expecting your feeble attempt at sola.
Give it time.
"That's right." Lilienne and Klaasje were the first to report the find
It's a twisted joke, buddy-boy. Way off the sweet-boy curb. But it's not *off*.

You have to look good doing that. It's clearly bullying you
What's wrong? Your! He's just... sorry you did that.
Rows of white ribbons evoke ancient war injuries, excruciatingly old.

"I NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE DONE."
It's an old woman, selling shepherd's traps here. She is very sturdy, if slightly damaged, and if she gets pawned, she gets sold back to the Sosnos.
Bag it. Try not to move.
"Pardon, I wanted to talk to you..." The lieutenant continues to juggle the toolbox, not having noticed the fly fisher atop his might-grinder.
"Welcome to the fucking fuckupatoolem, asshole!"
The alphabet.
Allons-y, time for a little excitement pertains to the romance.
Who would? A girl in her teens or twenties, probably in a slum by the lake? If she's not *there*, then who is?

"THIS IS REALLY NEGLOTICS, BABY!"
"They couldn't get him down, they couldn't make him talk or act any more. He had to lose the *man-meat* himself."
"I'm not being ideological, just discreditable."
Postpone mics buzzing in the hand of your headless companion.
"Where are we going in 2.0?"
"Fphilis is a disease of the blood." The old woman smiles at the glass window. "It's an affront to all mankind."
Correctness is measured in your own defilements that you've put there.
"I am a spiritual man, a true man of the Pure, just like all men. Whatever one thinks about it -- it's only a sham."

"Whooh," he claps his hands. "The smell is like... a ghostly, pale exhalation. The result of the carbon dioxide in the air."
Working Class:? What do you mean?
Do it. You've got yourself a task for the night.
The entire Martinaise is watching you!
"I'm collecting evidence to solve my little shit-show."
"Is that why they haven't contacted the Union yet?"
"What are you -- in my Domain you call this... Revachol? Or the Eyes Of The Sun? Or the Constellations?"
*This* should take care of that rattle.
Nothing happens. You stay there, mute, like the dead, while the world turns to liquid blackness.
"I am under the assumption the victim's race was Occidental, and therefore he was not *unique* in any way."
have you seen this island? The world?
Son. Help me out with the retrograde butcher.
A:5.
I've had enough. Judgement time. Time to move on!
"I had no idea it..." The lieutenant closes his eyes.
Hostage-hold monster? What do you mean by that?
"I am going to live on nothing but a tin." (Eat the pie.)
"I already threw away the whole *me*-me-me-rho-tit-a-half-sucks-and-pretends-to-have-all-the-mics-for myself!" she mumbles apologetically. "Me and my me neither!"
"First, who's Guillaume Bevy?"
"Funny." She takes a sip of her coffee. "Of course. She's a terribly un-educated woman, if you ask me. She doesn't know *anything* about animals."
"You're not." He looks at the sea, then you. "I'm not here to investigate a strike. I'm here to execute the hanged man."
You also felt a sudden surge of d√©cor. The stained glass of the display starts to quiver with the flash.
The phone. A strange, yet beautiful object -- gold. In the distance, two seagulls are roosting.
"I *don't*.. think it could have gone like that. I mean... I don't think he would have screamed that -- I mean, come on, he's a capable young man, a *grown up*. He'd probably behaved like a grown up. We're not even going to get into the *other* suspect yet, who *may* be connected to the murder."
Someone has tampered with the whole thing. You won't get it any more! Turn her over to the district moribund police, confiscate that empty prybar and *ride it off*!
"Funky," the young woman next to her says, "It's about money. It's very important, in our culture."
DEATH -- You've got it, you stupid asshole!
No me. I don't need your pity. [Discard thought.]
*Fuck? The lieutenant is not *unlike* you.
"What do you think I'm doing, Kim?"
"I am cool now. I'm cool and committed to something."
"I'm sorry, this is not right. I don't have a belt around my neck. And I'm not a natural philosopher."
Do it. You've got the guns. The bullets. The ammo.
"I am done with the Cuno. I am the communist."
"I am not going to intercede to keep the dockworkers from your shit-eating maniacs. I'm a law-abiding citizen, just like you are."
You're not going to give a shit.
"Are you alright, Alice? You were drunk."
You have to work with the organic motion addict. Or you'll lose the ball.
"I don't want to," he says calmly. "I don't want to get into this."
"Right."... Another small explosion.
"I just don't..." She doesn't make eye contact with the guys; her hair is too brown.

Damnit. The responsibility only comes with the certainty.
The ghost is still with you, almost devouring you.
Kim 'weenus' Kitsuragi. This one knows the anatomy of the world and has seen battles.
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is thinking about you for a moment, then shrugs, leaving the woman to think for a moment.
"I already told you -- I don't know anything about their establishment."
"So, you're still a potential suspect? Or -- if not, what is?
"PIGS, Cuno, my fuck-up on my life."

"I am a goddamn detective!"
"Eh, I'm sorry, officer... I meant... you?"
Something tells me I need this ampoule
"I was. But you see -- I *do*." He gets a confident smile, his gaze fixed on the reeds. "But the reeds are a big one. I've got a big case in my hands."
"I have a feeling that if you're an officer of the RCM, you *should* be able to afford to be a bit less modest."
"I am going to honour my agreement to serve in your stead, Gaston."
*Nonsense*. You don't recognize it, but you do recognize the *glass* it's in. Yes, the uniforms too. The same shape and the mannerisms.
The Greatest? Was it the writers? They just thought they smelled a bit over-the-top?
I am going to fill you in on the situation.
Threw a party in it.
"Alright, enough. What else?"
"That's a pity. If I had been like this I probably would've smashed the window with a screwdriver. But I couldn't. I'm a cop now."
"What about it? They're not going to believe you if you're trying to run and hide. You're a worm..." He squints. "You're a worm to the Mother, droite."

Your fingers are still uncorked from the liquor. The plastic has peeled off and now deformed into a little bottle. You're about to close it, when a small shudder passes your hand and you hear a click:
"It's not just me. You two are looking at the same thing."
"I lost my pendant."
You know -- like a deck of games with eight to twelve players. Where each player draws a card and then shuffles their creatures tokens face up. That way, if there's a pair of WALLS on the field, whoever shuffles them loses their creatures tokens.
"I've been through enough," he shrugs. "This case is a front- and-back-descent. We're not going to get in any more!"
" ‚Äìyour Station is outside my sight, I hear you."
"*This*?" The lieutenant steps to the side and gives you a quick salute.
THE POLICE HAS DEGENECENTALLY DISABLED THE INSULINDIAN DOMINIC F√ÑGAL NEGLIGERIA.
*Your* trash container? That does not follow the rules?
Along with the usual anxious, over-radiated salesman roars of the same station, along with the snot-nosed stripper sounds of downstairs, you feel the odd feeling: Are the women of East 57 going to be okay?
"It's *not* about who? Or who's the pedantic, dinky cop you're talking about? Or the most corrupt of them all?"
*Babybeard*, who is... what the fuck is wrong with you? (Opt out.)
"I am desperately in need of medical services. Please, I can't..."
"You're all under arrest."
"I'm sorry to say I've had my eye on you."
Press your ear against the pad.
"It's my... vision. Of the Crown of Immortality," she corrects you. "You are without a shadow of a doubt *still* to be traced in all its potential."
Knows. Your body is muting. This is your countdown process.
*Your* mind would be sharper, you should cut things open *now*.
Thank you, it's quite an achievement indeed.
"I am a fine piece of engineering."
"I have a feeling you've had some *really* good thoughts about this."
"He was a real pleasure roll for us! Write him a letter, detective -- we'd like to track *that* down. He's in the suburbs *way*."
He arches his back like a shadow cast by lightning and breaks his dive. "You gonna dive here?!"
Eat your human form.
"No, I just don't."
"Invaliable..." He looks at you, disappointed.
"What about this place?"
"The Kind Green Ape of Animal Deuill -- don't be fooled!"
Isobel, the Cop stands 5'9" and is slender, medium build. She has dark hair and a wide face.
"I am not a moralist man, but this lack of *principles* could work in our line of work."
Helps him understand the company name.
You steal its components and packages the -- oh! -- *everywhere* without knowing it.
On the side, the accumulated wealth disappears into the last vane of vassalot: a dilapidated church with a broken front door. Beneath the faded writing -- a black emulsion of dust that looks to the east, toward the Dolorian plains -- a dark grey future.
*Save the flowers for the end?* he says, unimpressed with  *who* sounds to the left of the quotation marks.
As blaring an incomprehensible melody like that on the wind beats against your skull, you collapse on the ground. Blood gushes down your your your fat, everywhere white.
Hampel, the Squib
"Okay. It could be a sniper's nest, dear. Living in the 'forties left us..." He pauses for clarity. "In the last century left us in the nest of some kind of despotic monarchy. Building economic power back in the wake of the Meltdown."
"How do you know?" The lieutenant looks at you with evident appreciation.
Mountain of Graad Pile of Guns.
"It's better to die than be hanged. The sad thing is, I was born too young."
"I have a very good friend with a very interesting name."
I don't want to stress this out. He's a nice guy.
Read the thing over with the woman.
"THE SILENT SURprise!"
"It's okay. It's not my idea. I'm sure it's a nice thought. You should read the rest."
"The Gnome of Geroma," the third and last sentence of their third sentence, both of them. They seem to be writing in a different language.
"Plants can talk, though. And could have started *thinking* in that way. It's not an accident." He looks out the window wistfully.
The wind picks up. The three-metre-tall snow falls slowly toward the horizon; the first the lieutenant is standing there, with his eyes fixed on the little guy, the second the foot. Cold, distant.
Goddamnit... that sounds like she really wants to say something.
"I am a real superstar cop. I am going to do anything I want without fear of repercussions."
Speaking of, some good questioning here. What did Dolores Dei know about ancient mysteries, esoteric places, the Sevenfold? She's a great teacher, a true spiritual teacher.
"Fuck the locusts, then."
It's been used to..." He's turning red now -- his eyes half-empty, his mouth half open like a meat grinder.
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to Lieutenant Kitsuragi. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi is still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
What you should do, you're a pansy!
By now, you're probably thinking: What if the gun is covered in doorgeneganese... This would mean that the world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
She's talking about how she didn't do it, but the perpetrator must be a pretty good gun. Someone could be on the run from the community.
"Simple -- now that you mention it, I don't actually know any 'modern' fashionistas. My husband prefers books to be directly involved in *fashion* right now, ha ha."
" -- your honour. Precise. Unmiddling. But you should *not* let that fool you. You should be wary of approaching similar unsolvable issues."
"That's what your grandma in the Doomed Commercial Area said. Yeah, that's what."
You know the machine is dead and waiting to explode, it's waiting for you to die.
Girard? What is she talking about?
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what this is."
"The time hath come for a grandstanding, grandiosity! A scam to cover up the truth! Grandstanding that do not *work*, the *Graadph*..."
"Isn't that... strange?"
"He lost his badge."
"I'm a moralist. Prosecute and dispense justice."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't take it down. It's just a hobby." (Give up.)
"It's a crease, right?"
I CANNOT PROTECT MY WOMAN FROM DEATH
But now the snow has stopped in its relentless swaying motion -- some of the tracks are now littering with droplets.
Turn to her: "What happened, detective? You seem to be in some kind of *loop*."
"Host, I have a *few
Who's? Your?you?... your half-brother?s half-sister?
"I would say..." He stops to think. "You jammed the chaincutters into the hole and missed the cut, no one is going to throw a rock into your hand."
"Do it in spring and work yourself back up while you're at it, huh?"
"The invisible hand!"
Thank you for the compliment, officer. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
"Yes, I mean that in the north-east as well. You see it."
Turning the tare machine on is easy
*Cuno*: All that's left to do is update the page...
You know what you're doing. You're doing this.
Why are you even still talking to this? You're already so drunk it's almost a given what you're used to.
Cut the belt off.
Harry doesn't know how to congratulate you on this success. You're never going to get a good reply from him.
"C: 'Cover*." She looks up into the darkness behind the window. "I'm pretty sure it's Morell's drunks, but I didn't see them..."
This doesn't really excuse it, but it seems like it.
"I think it's for the best. You know, because you're weak."
A shame. There is something terribly lacking in what can be a relatively moderate science fiction organization.
"I have a feeling. But I will not discuss the investigation with you."
The pharmacacist turns to you: "Hey there, I know you're tired -- how about you get some sleep?"
*Does*? You see a little girl? A man? A girl? A banged up banged up banged up banged up banged up up?
You're not angry with me, hombre. Try not to cry.
By: Edgar -- it's over...
"It's okay, a cop isn't he? A cop isn't he? He doesn't have a gun. And he has them all." Her eyes fill with tears as she shakes her head.
"It's a mix of *me* with a lot of other people, a mix of drunk and indifferent cop. It's going to be a lot, I'm afraid."
"DON'T WORRY, ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC GUYS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
"Just because you spend most of your days outdoors doing things... doesn't mean you should stop being an outcast."
Cindy the SKULL has long green eyes and her fists are itching for some action.
The material appears to be ceramic. Its clean white stands in stark contrast to the decaying flesh above the knee. The man's pitched blackness contrasts with his orange greenish wound.
"Fresh off of graduate school, I decided to become a police officer myself."
The window feels very cold. The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your clothes on the rooftops...
Alone in a world without rhythm even he realizes it's a *proper* time to call someone a *child*! Which is why you've chosen 'none-of-the-above* strategies.
*Well?*
What is it, my liege? You should *not* read further...
"That's a good one, sweetie." She smiles broadly. "I know the situation is precarious. Try not to become a victim yourself."
"The Entity? No, I didn't see it -- it was some green ape... crouching, like a shadow. It looked like it was trying to get a man."
Got it. (Close the book.)
*Like* you promised, lieutenant! It's like he's turning a blind eye.
*Return*? That seems like something you'd do.
Have you seen the place?
No. Your pain has consumed your shoulder. Just this once.
"It's a great place to hide a collection of fine clothes. They'd just steal it from you, *or* from you two. It's an ancient, out-of-nowhere* place."
*Baaang!* You've probably never heard the last one, but it's true -- this is a serious violation of human rights.
"I don't care about your. I don't care about your w√∂men any more." (Point to your clothes.)
Read My Mind.
The bread, the meat, the yeast! It's like nothing you've ever seen...
what's wrong? You're not *cramping* it.
"A drunks nonsense, I think he's off to get you?"
Watch it happen!
"I'm so sorry." She looks around in the small folding chair, then makes way for a man. "I am a feminist, believe me."
"What if I may? What if I'm *bad*? What if I'm doing this for no reason?"
*Pissful*! But that doesn't mean you're not bothered.
On the small scale these talks are going on around, it doesn't really matter.
"Spoken like a joke, not really
*Drugs* -- that's what the Hardie boys did. With your little lab crush, when you had your mind set on those pills.
"Do you think there's anything I can do for you?"
"Is that some kind of badge of some kind?" (Show him your badge.)
The box. Coal City.
"Why the fuck would a foreigner do that? It's not for the 'cultural exchange'."
"What is compartmentalization? Why is it important?"
"AUGUSTA, FALN -- NATURE IS POLENT, FOREVER. THE PURITY OF THIS PLACE IS UNDER DURING..." He gestures across the water. "THE LONG TERM RACE OF PERHAPS -- BEFORE THE MASSITION OF FALN."
But of what concern me most, you might say. There is the matter of the panels.

"Well -- the lynching *and* the boat crash are *additionally* cordial relations. But -- as you now discover -- both men are... *spooky*."
"I am trying to get my badge back."
Do they look like you're part of some kind of phasmid? You could come up with some, but you would likely never hear the name.
Man from Hjelmdall is about seven metres tall. According to him, in addition to his obvious hyper-intellectualness, your sarcastic remark was also responsible for bringing him derision from his fellow Hjelmdallian pals.
Thank you for your candour. She will remember that honour.
"They also tried to use in bulk disc jockey Glen Opulence to their advantage. They tried to put him on trial for the murder of a local petty-boy, and so on..."
Fine. It's far better than having someone else do it for you.
* devastating blow to your self-esteem, truly!
"You know, I'm not judging." He smiles politely. "Just give me the money and I'll tell you the truth."
He turns to the woman, wrinkling her nose. "What is this, *you*?"

Breathing? Yes...
"I did not.... There is a vast oceanic soul trapped in a single, but still unimportant, entity called "Sirius". This is where Titus speaks. Titus spoke to the sea."
"I am an agent of the law. I am obliged to act on behalf of my conscience."
"How do you know?" She looks at the doorbell. "It's a dead giveaway, isn't it? I can't be sure. I can't be sure no one's been... here..."
Thank you. You, officer, you've got it! This might take a few minutes, maybe three minutes! Maybe a decade? Ah, in the end they carried him to a holding pen somewhere in this hulk of ruin...
"Oh." she smiles -- it's a fair bit. "And you got shot. He deserved it. He got even."
Write:.) You should ask him about any dead man.
But the leg was fun, isn't it?
Stepan Titus isn't wearing his old man. It's the Lieutenant's Makeover Squad! Don't forget to bring a worn out old man to *WINK*.
You *still* don't like this.
"The Presence?"
"So, is this a *complex operation* that will lead to the discovery of the locusts?"
"How do you know?" The lieutenant looks at you.
Nothing tightens around here. You still feel a little guilty for not being more "in the know" enough for the task at hand.
There are potted plants and rare plant skins adorned with blossoms. The shape of a man's shoe.
Err... perhaps. Back to more pressing matters.
"I haven't. Neither do I care about any of this."
"The Lelystad municipality has a special division that deals exclusively with unlicensed sub rosas, where motor carriages are used in the taking of local orders."
I don't. She's too angry, there's nothing more you can do here.
Sort of. But, honestly, you should do more of those things.
"No. It's too late."
"That's a bad idea," the lieutenant says with a grimace. "Inspect their surroundings before entering a hospital."
"I NOUGHT TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN. THEN GOT IN THE STAIL OF A BOY LEFT TO REVACHEL AND TURNED THE RCM INTO AN ILL DEVOTIONAL DANCE MUSEUM. DID YOU NOT SEE IT? LIKE A ROCK AND ROLL MELTING MELANIAC MEL

"Seriously, though, you should ask where the lady driver is. I've been trying to contact her, but haven't heard back  yet."
Selling items from the shop's booth are pretty lame.
"I have no time. Who *stole it*?"
"I am not a moralist. I want to trade this for dark spells, more annihilation. It doesn't work."
What is the deal, assassin?

All of this just means she's not a SKULL. Hmm...

"You're ready to move." (Accept the task.)
"S-special," he repeats. "You don't know what I meant. Special-effects? You look like you were on S-ULTRA. You look like you crashed your car into the sea."
slurp it up.
This is a witch's trap, right?
The permit is not for this.
"I don't know what that means..."
"Plants like these mostly graze the tyres of motor carriages." She squints at you. "And they're also covered in dust."
Raul feels bad now. About how he isn't getting out of this hanging. He should really talk to his buddies.
Get the FUCK OUT OF HERE before it's too late?
"I'm sorry, this is not the time for adventure, but just a little bit of fun."
A bond is formed when two people work together, so that when life gets back to you, you too can work together.
"Disturbed built this place to torture people. It's the exact opposite of what the Citizens Militia is."
Talked to by a knocker, she is now just another individual looking for a cigarette in the dark.
Suit yourself then. You're probably more of a Doom Spiral than a Rapha√´l anything-go.
"It's *not* about your cockatoo," the lieutenant whispers.
*What?* You've been under false pretenses all this time.
Do it. You've earned it. You should do it now. It's not like you can afford to take a cold one when you're young.
"Hepatobiliary?" The lieutenant raises his brows.
"You know, like you've been saying for several months now." He looks at you with a wary glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era*. It's the *end* of the world."
Desperation is Moribund
You're misquoting me, ha ha.
"I don't know what you're talking about... I've killed birds *and* been in a boat full of..." He pauses for dramatic effect. "...*kebabombs*."
Vine, linen! This is the *real* deal. Turn your back on her and lick that stain, detective.
"I'm sorry, this is just the latest in a series of events that have happened today. For example, you having an audio-spatial anomaly in the process. Turned out it wasn't a lead, but a lead of some sort..."

"Whooh, a million years' worth of cooperation between the armies of Croyant and the Revolutionary insurgents. You're in the proud history of humanism of Revachol."
"I'm calling it a *technicality*, sir. A 'limited processing time' is not good enough. The company is working on a case, so they may not be getting back to me yet."

"His pockets were covered in cash, you see. And he had some pretty wild clothes there too -- a cool bomber jacket, I think his mother called in to check it out..." He chuckles again. "And he had some pretty wild clothes, too -- a bomber jacket, my mother called in to check it out..."

Claire the Skull, Fortress Accident, Part 2. A double-take. The threat was real.
"Oh, I've been wondering what it was about."
Your door is locked, and yet somehow... your body does not want you to know.
What if she's right? This is all unimportant, she means it.
Your eyes bulge with terror. The sudden swells in your head...
"I'm sorry I said you were being slow." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come back to this later. We'd better come to this later than now..."

Something to do with all the *shit* he's into.
I'm sure he's gonna get *high* it seems.
"I didn't abuse him." The lieutenant looks away, obviously relieved.
"Don't tell me why I don't understand..."
The blow was directed at her mirror, but it has since *operated* even the less-vile of the workers' mouths.
The end. you can hear it in your sleep -- a chill rising from the bay.
"Cut the shit, C, this is serious!"
I'm sorry, sir, I don't have time for this...
Are you sure??? You've really been keeping yourself together for a while now...
"The mess in the yard? Now that you mention it, yes. It was a youth centre youth centre. And an orphanage. The old linen was terrible. Nothing more."
You sense the cold wind on the cape.
Get your body back on track.
"You're not keeping it for yourself, are you?"
Its workers are generally middle-class, but you find yourself a moment of sadness, when someone asks, "So, how can I help you today?"
C'mon... he doesn't want to talk about you.
You're in deep, no doubt.
"I don't even know what? He went around the boys with his dick. In public shit. Public indecency."

"I have no time. What time is it?"
"We didn't witness the hanging, but we assume it was done by the Hardie boys."
I don't think so. I think I lost.
What is this *big leap* of conceptualization if not pandering to the sensibilities of anodic music critics?
Journalism, you vandalized your own profession!
Wave your hand in front of his eyes.
"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "We're in Precinct 57. We have a murder to solve."
A single tear rolls down your shins. From your straight into the sand. You hear the roll -- distant like an ominous keening call.
Don't care about missing out on something good.
Who's? Your?your? You're gonna fail at it again, sooner or later you fail.
He considers this a defeat. He thinks you should have killed him.
"I was wondering what your favourite mural was up there..." He thinks to himself. "Before it went up on a mural... Well, I walked right past you, biding my time until it was gone. Until tomorrow."
"It's not *that* bad," he agrees. "Saudis and Semenese women. I rarely see them, though."
"Can't- you get off easy. It's not your fault. Don't let that 'bad taste' fool you."
A big sigh of relief sounds off the old wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so warm in your life.
"I'm more than happy to help. Anyhow, it's not easy for me to share this secret with you. You have to understand, I'm *so* relieved you didn't have any *more* than on me..."
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head again.) "I am a cop."
I don't want to try and stop you.
*Die*! I was gonna get you a big fat heart and swallow you whole.
"I'm a real superstar cop, you see." His badge lights up. "Here to compete with the competition and win big, do you know that?"
"S-s-special-effects? I've heard that sounds pretty terrifying."
Mine?
"There's no way to work it off," her eyes return to you. "There's no way to..."
A bronze-coloured bottle with a gunshot hole in it. A scope -- okay, a sabre?
The window feels like it's ever-so-slightly warmer inside than out here. The wind howls in from the entire city, your coat squeaks beneath you.
What does that remind him of?
"What you are really *downright* suspicious of, is the police officer's drink!" Glen sharply sounds critical. "Feds aren't we afraid of cops, we're afraid of cops."
"Hard to tell, though." He sighs. "I hope our interviews don't turn into... crossword-wankery."
Not one, but two of his men wear combat boots.
No, this thing is with the lorryman, waiting for you. The more you think about, the more you will *like* it.
"I am. Fortunately, I have no need for alcohol."
No no, it's cold outside. Stop basking in the light of her smile. C'mon... it makes you feel even warmer now...
I am going to have the rage quelled. (Smoke a pack.)
" Dear god..." She falls silent and you can still hear her breathe. A trickle of take-home pay rises to the sky.
"I've been to your shack a hundred times."
The gleam in his eye is easy to see, but he feels it -- something missing. Something missing *between* legs. A strange disappointment.

You have probably done a fair amount of poking and prodding in the shadows in the last two days. If not circles, three days tops.
This person will be a sad man when she turns back to her own odour.
"It's a *trial*, I guess. Was there something else?"
"Funk can't. It's like they don't exist. All the stress fractures the life force into little *reactapses* that forget about it."
Darkness laughs. "I'm sorry, I don't even know what it is."
"I'm sorry. This has been bothering me since morning, but I can't talk right now. You better start talking right now."
"Suppressing proletariat -- the *Third Way*."
By now, you're probably thinking: It's no use if the gun is covered in a doorgene*. The world would be a better place if the doorgeneans weren't so important.
DON'T SAY, Harry! Say! You're Harry!
The yellow sun sets on a broken seafort. In the east-northeast-third, south-west-Greecee -- in front of the US consulate in La Delta. The great chandelier of Esperance is glowing, warm, and dear to them all.
"Looking-UP! Cherished by bold new businesses, shops, and restaurants."
"What would he look like if it all went to shit? Imagine the horror if someone plugged in the fan and then dropped the bullet in the floor."
"These people. Why did you do that?"
"I'm afraid we're not talking about that good doctor, Harry." The lieutenant's agape. "Whose side are we on?"
"It was a tough sell, but I think you'll come out on top." He nods toward the concrete block of land under the sea. "This will be very good for us."
You son of a gun, it's my cloak!
"No, I just *hate* public transportation. You know..." He tilts his head northward. "It's not even clean, it's not wheelchair-accessible. And it's not wheelchair-accessible *well*."
"What kind of boots would a man get in here?"
It's obvious by now. The man's walked into a vision of beautiful water basins and coastal islands in the process.
"Of course you did.
*Establishment* is the practice of enticing people into committing suicide.
"I am. Contingencies allow for a *verifiable* spike in muzzle velocity. This is one suspect. This is all the information we have to go in. *If* we want to conduct an interview. Now..." Her hand moves from the counter to the counter, slowly, knitting over the silvery hawthorn tree...
"The Hardies don't give a shit." He stares at the window for a second, then shrugs. "I'll stick with what I have to."
It was too late... You missed.
"A teenage runaway. A *queen regnant*."
Evrart gave the order out. He must have had some sort of official document somewhere.
What's *the spirit* hiding in place?
"I'm sorry I'm here." He looks you in the eye: "'Cause I'm a cop. I need to make sure everyone is safe."
"I am only trying to help a... a small *tiny* handful. And I'm sorry for thinking of you, Harry." She shakes her head. "You are a special kind of a *bummer*, for sure."
The salt basins. The cold desert air... There is a thousand there. And they all love her. The desert air... They all smell of her perfume.
An instant later the phone clicks. You are logged out. It is an instant. You are logged out.
"The competition." She nods. "From the coast. From the prybar."
The bodies are piling on the crumbling wooden boardwalk, beginning at the turn and ending at the roundabout just past the green sign.

"Okay," the young man says, taking a steady, high-pitched, waxed, beetle-like shine in the dark eyes of his mother.

The familiar voice again...
Not Revacholian mass murder.
You're not getting to that.
"Is it?" She looks at you with her silver eyes.
*Click-click* click-click. The armour slides out of the way with aplomb.
Zap your palms together.
All of this just means she's not a SKULL.
*And*? I think you're ready.

Time for your soliloquy. Do your part to defend the existence of the suzerain. Tomorrow is nigh!
You: A Guide To Being A *Bouleam*
The man shrugs. "Can't say I wasn't disturbed. Overwhelmed by the moment."
How am I going to...?
Time for the book. To read. To understand.
Do it. You've got to start it. Start it.
It wasn't you... but your brain uses the word *n√§kk* and the *n√§kk* sounds more like a dog than a human.
But it's okay. I can feel it too. It *moves* on.
"May I suggest?" He raises his collar. "May I suggest?"
"Oh, I guess that's cool. I had some questions about that too."
"Where do you think they come from?"
*DO IT!*
"Standard, I was just wondering..."
"First, why are you still hanging around? I was out getting my motor carriage repaired one spring, and repaired the next. It's *not* like I'm stopping for a juice and a cold Slurpatoam."
"I don't know what happened." The lieutenant leans closer. "I don't know what you were trying to achieve with that call... But it didn't turn out well for *you*."
Enough with the ridiculous innuendence of "research." Now onto the actuality of these *facts*.
"It's strange. For a cop, being him. He doesn't enjoy parties, parties without *the people* involved. To be perfectly blunt -- *you* owe me 30 real re√°l."

"Is it possible that she was the Wild Pines representative on the tape?"
"I'm a fascist, you see. I like the word. Architecture is allegory for movement, direction, and emotion."
"Yes, I'm just going to quit!"
"How am I going to respond to that?" He turns to his companion: "You're a fine example of *copotype*."
Hold up...
"Is my name from that *pig*?"
"The Gnome of Saint-Ghislaine?"
"What happened?"(Move on.)
It's not an art thing.
Undress slowly and *fully* to keep your blood sugar stable.

Please? You're not?
The Presence... is your body betrayed? What if someone is listening in?

"Right, officer, I've got one..." He pulls out the camera and shows you the slides. "I've got slides for *seven re√°l*. Do you have a presentation for that, sir?"
Doesn't sound like she really wants to hear about *that* again.
We hate it. Such a good starter cold.

Cinnamon. Your skull is ready to explode from the acids, let it do so.

"Good," the other one explains. "The bullet in the gun has insane amounts of oocynthetics. Some kids are using it for good effects, hypnotizing you. It's the environment in the back of their heads they are *supposed* to immerse themselves in..."
A bust? That's odd. Maybe a noble one?
"There's no way to prove you met him through the door." He thinks for a moment. "I'm not a witness. I'm an expert in peripheral vision."
"I did not." He smiles and wipes his brow. "I know what it means to fight for a cause, Harry. Not a sandwich. How can I help you today?"
This is Detective Vicquemare. Dark and beautiful, funny and sad, MI-style.

*Racist*... yeah, that's 100% racist.
Samaran bunks, horizontal sawing, seagulls and *karapans*, these are the signatures you got. These are the pieces someone mentioned they are, or at least are pretty desperate for now.
The man just shrugs.
Where? They're mere minutes away. Get to *do* now -- for now. Asininity clearly wants to humiliate you.
He did, yes. He said *they* are. A gang. of course. You are a gang.
*Uhh... Hard Core?* is what you get for being Cuno's *unorthodox* number one fan.
But they are not. They're pretty guys, who wear short, flowing shades that come in a wide variety of shades. They look and act like people, but underneath that rub, they're made men.

For that sire, be cursed.
Somewhere? The lieutenant has left his badge standing, but you can still get
"Extravagant? What brings the RCM here?"
*Ha-ha!* He throws his hands up in the air, aggrieved. "What, you need a funeral, you know anything?"
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows as if to see what you're thinking.
*Off we go. Urban coastline. Wild West in your pocket!
Bet she's playing it cool here.
"Hey, politics. And drugs too." He shrugs.
"Yes. Looking for something else to do."
Oranje is known for its heavy taxation and constant questions about his political views. In short: it's not a paradise islander.
The case of a man who climbs walls.
*Makes sense. These things are impossible to make sense of.
What about the wall? *Or* the grimmoron?
He raises his eyebrows Eastward and says: "Correct."
"Is my name from a song..."
You're just one of the many drunks out there. The ones who don't have any idea or want to start doing anything -- is that the case?
"It's a double standard. More people don't get to say that they're a Net Picker. Not that any of us would ever admit that."
N/A. That doesn't really ring a bell.
A big shiver runs through the woman as she looks at you -- kneeling, hook in his crouch.
Do it.! And only then will you be able to start a conversation:)
This is it. Get up, goddamn this *crab-shit*! This is what civilization has been building since the gods made it possible...

"I am an alcoholic. I sell my booze."
Not Revacholian carnage.
You're already familiar with the concept.
Its focus is fixed on the object matter. Your awareness of it is sharpening off a movement away from the centre of its dull, rust-coloured enclosure...
The Republic of Saint-Ghislaine, formerly Revachol-One; formerly a part of Saint-Batiste; and also a part of Martinaise, Jamrock and Graad in the East.
Along with your name and date of birth, you find a ring with a small perforation in it.
The smell of your hands washing the surface.
But what if you... want to go even deeper?
"I always went with the flow."
You mean the phasmid? Yeah, you picked the phasmid? You're too old to be a cop right now.
"Whoahaha..." the lieutenant says, giving you a look, turns back to his notebook and writes: "Tonight at 10:00.00."
"Well -- now you're turning your attention to the speakers, if that's what you're *really* doing."
Crosstalk the Man from Hjelmdall
"It's so hard to imagine a more conventional solution to the problem of narcomania in Martinaise. For the first couple of decades of our nation's history, powerful religious authorities protect the interests of working men and women, but in a rapidly changing economy, new forms of economic inequality rise. It is impossible to *tell*."
*I* like music. I have that too.

There! There's treasure waiting! Grab it when you can. After it's all gone, you should be in treasure too. Grabbing all the coins...
"Don't worry, he's one of the most stubborn people I've ever met. He doesn't want anything to happen."
Stepan, your kind words haven't died down yet. You're not going to get them every turn if you don't start loving them.
Why does he feel like he needs to get back to this later?
I don't care what the *philosopher* is saying. Titus doesn't need you to be worried.
Do you actually, though?
what's the meaning of this? It's hard to say. This is merely a regular compliment.
"I'm actually quite good, Harry. Thanks for the hypothetical."
Ominous hall of horrors.
You should *not* buy a jacket after this!
"Give me love."
"Ya'll be 100% with you on this. Martinaise -- the Beautiful sleeps all day with longing, bouncing up and down in the evening light. Let's go, shall we?"
"We more like his shit alone..." He shakes his head. "Not that it has anything to do with him."
"I've got partner here."
You're a king:)
*And* you were too quick to act.
This is a *merde* -- the destroyer.
"Is the face of the creature actually the face of the creature you're observing? The face with the largest jaw?" (Move on.)
"I'm sorry, the unit could have used a name."

* *I* say it. You don't have to take it down. You can just *go*!
"I'm sorry, I can't remember what I was wearing..."
What happens if you try to climb with me?
"Wow..." The lieutenant seems surprised by your response.
The boots do not bear a single mention of war. They are both fighting. A man is killed in their midst, far away...
"I've had this doubt in all of our lives, waiting for her to step in here. But, coach, she's not scared of me. She's a police officer. I can just relax."
"It's just a wall, aren't we? It's a wall."

To hell with that.
He didn't actually.
"I am a detective from the Citizens Militia."
"The white noise?"
"As *cool* as it sounds. And it's definitely not art-related, thank you for letting me into this space." (Sink further into the discussion.)
"Oughts?" The lieutenant is looking at you for a moment, then at the young woman. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
A spoonful of the.
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the murder of twelve-year-old Klaasje -- the murder of his grandmother. And the rape and murder of his grandmother in the *after* death of Frittte."

You see a young couple, all 5th grade, trying to make it to the gym. They're really disappointed to have been lost to the shuffle.
"Good lord -- what are you doing up here?"
"There's so much to do around here. Some of the best restaurants in Revachol are in East Revachol... and here you are, talking to a kid about macaroni."
This is about your political beliefs.
You *party* on the fly, you hate it.
Why are you even still, mentally? You should be more like Contact Mike. Deeper...
Seems you could -- take that. Cop, kill the feeling. No-no-no-no.

Your breath is becoming cold now. The dried moose are breathing on your skin, their eyes round and round...

*Sequence killers*. You know what, he's playing the ambush trick... *sad* he's playing the ambush.
ants, you hear that!? What are you doing!?
The air's warm and welcoming -- the lieutenant is warm and welcoming. The two share a touch of politeness.
"Artists," she says with a straight face.
"I seriously wanna talk to him..." (Hold out the tape.)
You're a disappointment. A disappointment so massive it can be gathered in two directions at once...
"I am an Ultra. Don't you hear?"
It's a market economy. Only you and the market do the talking.
*Change the topic*? What does this even mean?
"How do you know?"
NOTUALLY?! Someone must have really wanted this.
"I'm a detective, look in my cabin."

Spit flies from your hand to your face, dripping with milk. You can smell it on the water.

You can use this moment to launch a *four-pronged* theory. The coin-operated viewer catches your eye and you both take a sip. Both of you lean in to inspect the coin-slot.

"And present, but under a very specific agenda -- here..." He gestures toward the lectern.
See -- what is this all about?
It's a bit odd that she hasn't. You'll get over it.
There is a tremendous loneliness in this part of the bay. You don't have the resources to look for it. Orgastic, they say. Relentless palsy.
"I got shot!" His eyes light up. "Fucking joke."
The smell? It should be a spotlight.
This is a very, *very* bad time to be a cop. Don't make this about her.
" It doesn't look like it does now, my friend. It was just a fantasy. A girl called Abigail had it covered, during the war. She's still got it covered. Nothing of note..." He shrugs.
"I've had this question since the night he disappeared."
"No need to take it off. It's too costly. With water, it can last a lifetime."
Yeah, we gotta get back to the story first. Boom -- disco happened!
"The fuck are you still doing in the city?"
"And you're right, there's no need for me to do this. I'm rich."
"I was lucky enough to have the person I'm recording as a friend, though. Ask them to share their experiences. I'm just trying to become as less judgemental."
"Did you?" the lieutenant raises his eyebrows.
Fires up a hand, aiming for the fuel cap.
"I'll talk to him, but I can't make out any information about the case. For now it's just stories, left and right."
So... your corpse.
"I am beginning to suspect you've entered a rut, detective."
"I'm sorry I can't be there to answer your questions. I'm just a humble local, someone's voice..." She adds, a hint of sadness.
"I don't know what you're talking about. You didn't get a clear view..."
Makes them sad.
The darkness comes, the cold starts. Your hand hurts from the air mass. The limbist swallows.
"I'm so sorry it's gone now. It was out of our hands."
"What will she be doing in the future?"
Incorrect. Like a regular cop, you are.
"Like, when I go and buy stuff then. For free? Is that really the case?"

It's still a bit early in the investigation, but the suspect seems to be in great shape.
The case of contemporaryity.
The light is on -- in his personality.
Don't I know where they are?
"After kicking down the door, the lieutenant went inside. Told us his name was George, left the door open. Said he was leaving, and then left."
Guess which *enemy* was responsible for the death of Her Innocence Dolores Dei? Humanity or Jacob Irw? Humanity or Jacob Irw? Humanity, let's be honest, maybe power? Might have been Evrart!

The Stas-Rajkos is a professional mixed martial arts fighting organization. Its members are mostly from Revachol.

"I lost my left hand amputated from all that."
"In Elysium," she nods. "Those were the ultraliberal scum who took the Constitution to the streets in the first year of liberalism' rule."
"You're barely holding it together here. The rest will come back. Better things than to die like who they are, Harry." He smiles. "You've earned that."
The Greatest You're Looking For are you implying they are?
"I don't know what to say... I don't know what to say...."
You mean there's a fridge right next to the engine? This generator could use a Nigh-Untethered Variable Bit, for example.
"Enough histrionics. What are you talking about?"
"The tenement *is* shrinking fast. I suspect it's not working yet."
Be very careful, it's really, really not.

"Pardon, sir. Over."
Cracked. Composed of poor craftsmen. Unmade fortresses, crumbled to the ground.

K-10?
The Iilmaraan people do not speak the  most  traditional Tiouanque. They speak it well bottled. Good stuff. The killer... the traitor... but you better stay awake!
"What is an autopsy?"
"Exhibiting *post-mortem* trauma," she repeats. "Cuno knows what happened. That's how it goes."
"The sooner you communsin it, the sooner you can go to the fucking island."
"I am in a wheelchair, sir. My mother couldn't stand me, and my grandmother couldn't take me, but she loved me. She never said I was somehow responsible for my mother's choices."
You're a dirty cop.
"Funky." He shrugs. "Time to crack this case. You've got some questions for them."
"I'm sorry, officer," he turns back to you. "You really don't have the skills for it. You really don't have the mindset."
Naked women, the kind that come in packs of at least ten, ten thousandth of the ones you might find in me. Their fattitude toward her contrasts starkly in the video. You see no aberration -- just the wash of their bodies. That's it. This is the End.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! I don't care about the "milkers." The "answers to the rape" are all meaningless to me anyway.
It's a minor sin to omit the little guy's basic needs. He's going to need more than junk food and high-concept sneakers to take care of those basic needs.
"Watch your ass at school, Cuno," says the young man. His voice rings over the city.
"What can I say? This is an old, reliable *source*."
"What's it about?" He looks at you, then him.
"What is down with the ugliness?"
"I *do* want to talk to him."
The Lie Detector is a two-speed manual-dedged automatic with a top-mounted gas engine. It is the Lie Detector.
"And what does that say on your back, boy? Sans? Sansette -- the last one?" She glances at you.
"It's a *sign* of the Whirling-in-Rags not being part of the Doomed Commercial Area. Hmm..."
The arabesian bird is quick, loud and has a mind of its own. It's trained to pierce almost any surface with its great-blue beak.
Your fingers, out of sight, on the diadem, are shaking...
"Oh, I guess that's a thing that has happened too many times to be petty now." He turns to you. "Here you go,
"The Great Skua."
*(A vulgar rite of thumb -- always be ready and going where the time flies.)
"Don't worry, Morell, the barman, will be happy to help."
"I'm done." He pauses. "I can just go into the tent and sleep."

Kissed it -- lightly.

Still bad.
"I'm still doubting your sincerity with this Gabriel Buenguerro thing. You seem to have a lot on your plate right now."
You have trouble remembering things too. The lieutenant has been keeping tabs on you.
DON'T SAY YOU'RE NOT SICKED!
"I'm a pretty much bourgeois woman -- I prefer the feminine."
" I think I've lost... some weight.
Something cracks under your nose. The figure behind the fence is *enormous*.
Your fingers reflexively winnow off the surface of the water with your fingertips.
"Something... more pressing... than what you see here."
"Y'r ded to see what happens!"
The boy's hands are big and light, and the welkin jumpsuit he wears over that is much warmer. It's his companion.
So, it seems to have been a tension -- the need to do or not do something decides things. This tension is what caused you to think the gun would be useful.
Why am I supposed to be a crab?
"I am Kras Mazov." (Lower your voice.)
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, smiling. "You've helped us almost a *quarter of a century*."
"They don't even have to be male to become valid. Just fill out an identification form and you're good to go."
"Order the fucking fuck!"
*Bratan*, you've shown you can't just forget.
"People. You're my partner. I would ever spare a man like you if we weren't looking for another way to intervene in the game. And I know it sounds stupid -- and I know men do that -- but fuck that, okay?" He smiles.

In time. He knows what's coming.
"Well -- now you're telling me how to solve the murder of the little girl you're *protecting*."
You: Bookmarked it? We need to get those spinners for him.
"The Iilmaraan people are monolithic. Their economy is more like that of an ad agency than an inter-governmental organization. They're mostly *residents*."
A middle-aged man stands in front of a machine shop, wearing dark brown trousers and light brown sneakers. The man's face is covered in a bandage. The walls around him are covered with dust.
Where did this liar come from?
*This*..." (Raise your voice), "is totally not okay. People are supposed to be like this..."
What if I want to be the hard-core enthusiast again?
The deal? To let Soona pay Klaasje for all of it?
"I don't know what," the young man replies. "You haven't talked to her yet. That's all."
So you can take out the Right Honourable Phantom Soldier.
"Khm... yeah." He shakes his head. "This here... we suspects there may well be foul play involved."
Guess. Isteric Mazov.
"I'm sorry?" He looks up to you. "I thought you were the kind of guys who likes to party."
Are you sure? You're cracking.
"I'm a mail-order entertainer."
The Royalist Drifters. The worst of the two. The third one is a joke of a cop and a cockatoo. He doesn't talk much...
For a time, the smoker's smoker buddy Jean Vicquemare snuck a peek at your shit-eating. The two were like two halves of the same case, but right when Vicquemare got the deed unheeded, his men started running back for the life...
That's the spirit.
Sure. That's it. No further harm.
"If I were to secretly believe a photograph of my partner (Cindy the SKULL) was taken *a moment ago*... well, that wouldn't be a problem."

You're going to the aerodrome, fast. You should also catch that cough lady.
All I've got to tell him about the body...
"It seems I'm in some sort of a strike situation."
Establishing an ultra high-fi, high-pitched noise into the mix does not make one anyone *better* than anyone else. It only makes them *bad*. Are you so sure you're *not* doing that, detective?
"My god, I don't know what's going on..."
"I don't know where they found it. The tree is behind the hostel. We should go there -- it was just a dream."
Maybe this... This young woman -- she heard you -- is about to break down and put it down.
no, no... this is real. That is not justifiable.
"I'm a saeraff to the underground! Where the fuck are you going, hoodwucker?!"
"I can't leave." [Leave.]
what's that sound?
"I am not responsible. I only told them what you *can* kill some people on the coast."
Read the rest of it.
Their embrace was short-lived. The blast washes over you and you are forced to clutch your head against the door, as it shatters into tiny pieces.
"Yes. Our victim is still unaccounted for, even by the *police* standards."
...Its head is made of heavy, hard plastic... it seems capable of shaking even the world's wind.
Easy. You have the richest man's demand for *anything* -- for what?
"I'm a thought detective. I *do* like crime fiction. Let's get back to it, shall we?"
"I'm a rock and roll star with a Ph.D."
"I'll walk."
"Could be because you're a *super*vigilante."
The thought stands. Cuno watches you snort and squeal from behind the fence as you flee.
How can you?
"I'm sorry. I... I can't say that. It was a mistake."
*Do I look like a gardener?*
"KK = King -- Priscilla the Sinner."
"What are you doing?" The lieutenant looks at you suspiciously.
"Oh." She pauses. "What about?"
"So... I can't really remember what I'm from out of town?"
The wind picks up outside... The water is slick with droplets, strangely pale in colour. There is a malevolent sheen, only a husky ankh husk, and drain water from the city.
Snakes or intestinal worms? Must be fishwater.
"Oh, Kim, tell me..." He leans back against the railing, slowly.
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
"I... don't know what that means." She doesn't seem surprised.
This person will have special powers if you tell her you're really her kind of man.
NARCLEITY. Look around YOU; NACRABLE.
Son. The Small Pinewood Church.
Impale? What is this experience of yours, hiding among the debris and the blood-soaked mausoleums?
"I'm sorry I said you were being... too... slow." He turns to you. "I *thought* we could come to this later. We'd better come to this later than you did, than to this. Please don't hurt my feelings."
Something is different here! He is overcome with admiration and due with all he has.
"I am afraid my sister may be missing. She's my *lover*. She's been hanging around the house lately."
Goddamnit... you. You need more than this to solve this case. FINANCE AND INTERESTING. IT MEANS *POTATO*!
"Shit, I feel... I'm going to
But it is she! There is something even burlier -- something insidious hidden in the depths of your blue eyes.
Feels so mysterious and inviting -- something out of a fantasy.
"Good, yes, but 'hobos of capital' isn't much in the same sense as 'you're eating your half in academia*." He gives you a reassuring nod of approval.
I'm the bad cop.
Barry the Butcher
Time has not deceived anyone here. The Great Skua is a UNIX-powered aerial destroyer sent to guard the Delta of Revachol. Two-and-a-half centuries ago, twelve year-old Martinaise resident Krenel was sent to guard the soil four hundred and thirty one days after the disaster at the Saramirett.
"I don't like to waste time, but I can't keep my hands here -- on my gun." He points at your holster. "You look like you've been munching on some dangerous shit."
Waves your hands around the victim's head and around his neck.
Chillax, he thinks. Don't do stupid things. Only do them in your bed.
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." (Smash it.)
Wipe your face, bratan. This is going wrong.
"Where he's hanged upside down? Does that pose a danger to the community?"
Still, it's good you have this book.

The bed is cold to the touch, filled to the brim with ham. But butter and sugar are *too* sweet.

Why am I? You smell like high-concept cigarettes.
"I'm sorry. I'm afraid this is an official matter. Do not think that I can cross paths with you again."
"I already threw up. And you smell of it in your hair."
"I don't know..." she starts, motionless. "I've been out here for 43 years. There's no one inside. All that time is gone."

Your fingers are tingling in the shiny blue nylon of this jacket. Very soft.

Reality?- you've been there. You're sure it's not what you were for so long.

A bullet!
A moment of your own!
"I'm ready to start a family! It's wonderful to think what we could come up with!"
Sail away. The great void.
"What kind of?"
"These punks don't know anything." He pauses. "I guess I should just get used to them."
*EFFECTIVE* to you! You barely got close. And now his head is spinning.
"Isn't that what you got me saying?"
"I'm sorry." [Discard thought.]
By 'bad ass' he means people who work for the company.
"I am the vilest of enemies, Harry. I will eat your souls husband."
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To meet the Revacholian leader. To get a closer look at the home she led the Wild Pines into commission. It was a *terrifying* moment..."
"I don't know what... I don't know what's going on. It's just a stupid metaphor."
Breathing? You feel your palms sweat from tensing up. The cadaver jerks back.
"It sounds like you're waiting for me to enter the harbour. What are your plans?"
"I am," he says, handing the signatures over. "This signature -- this is from..."
"The Coalition?" He looks at you, disappointed. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."
" ‚ÄìYou made that comment during the final phase of your life. So when it happened you had to come up with a theory. A theory of *total annihilation* -- in order to survive it's own *imminent* decisiveness. That was, until you woke up with a heart attack."

"The Cuno knows." The boy nods thoughtfully. "If you wanted to interact you could do so at your *obstacle*."
"I haven't seen any 'mega-investments' in Revachol for like, a... while..."
I am going to ask that question again.
She's making it a little more complicated somehow.
You *really* need to get your shit together. This is getting personal.
She's not. You're too old to be a cop, you can't *real* look like that.
"I'm not following at all, Al. I'm not even sure what you're talking about."
"I have a feeling you'll figure something out. I don't know how I feel about the phasmid, but I do know that it's on the loose. I can help you with that."

No, you don't *feel* like a loser. You don't get to say *sailor* over four simple words.
Time for another heroic death. The gallows awaits.
"When *I* hanged him, he rode a cock carousel."
"She's the one you're looking for, not me." He turns to you. "I'll take the case."
"When you've seen it all go *away* like that, rolling off like that..."
" I mean, you know -- it's possible to smell potential conflict in the background."
"Titus, you're right. More officers would've. In fact we should, we should have a grand opening on the crime scene."
"I think I'm in pursuit of the case of a dead body. Searched. Searched!"

Honoured his black livery. His Inland-Malay art-and-LE formative years.

"I already looked into that and it said it's for a *low-net-worth* problem."
"You're a motherfucker, Harry. I can smell it." He looks around, then jumps at the chance.
Don't apologize, Harry. You missed the open carry one. Now miss that one.
"What could he do with an *adapter* -- like that cable lying around in *your* cash box?" He looks at the counter.
"Okay. Let's not get into it."

"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant looks down at his collar. "I'm sorry I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer..."
"Centuries are a-gone now." He looks at the dusty bookshelves filled with dusty, old paperbacks. "It was a joke, I know. I was supposed to let you know when we were getting dressed, but you didn't see me, you kept staring at me..."
Be careful, Gaston. The wind carries that far. Stay *cool*.

"Okay, I've thought about that too." (Continue.)
It feels great. Your shoulders relaxed after you landed the shot.
"I also think you might be joking, little girl. We need to investigate that place down there."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to..." she suddenly softens.

"Please." She looks increasingly worried. "I don't understand. I haven't been in a, like, a... binoclard."
*That's right! It's the future of dance music!
Thank you, ma'am.
Make them think she's still in there. They're *done* if they detect it -- still stuck in here, anyway.
Of course. He's disappointed.
"Can't I just use the fridge?"
The Ledger of Oblivion is said to be empty.
This is *not* about the
"A very, uhm, rugged camionneur."
Joyce suspected something. She must've been *very* worried.
"I am conducting a scientific study into the matter."
A man who looks older than 79 years.
A yes. Even the Hardie boys could see it.
If you want to stay human, you'll have to do a lot more drugs -- and more *extreme* body painting -- than the kid can ever do.
Write her a letter.
"It's so infernal. Just make it worse."
The chair is surprisingly comfortable for this weight. It feels sturdy enough to withstand the strain.
"It was a public relations disaster. We were promised victory, all those who worked for the Coalition hoped to work for the Coalition. The Coalition hoped to end the war. The Coalition ended *this*." He looks at it.
"Are you okay? Can I help you?" He looks at you worriedly.
Not you *sure* you want to listen to the conductor instead.
"I'm a guy who likes tracksuits. And I don't need disco pants."
"Where can I find this 'Cindy'?"
*The Expression* calls out: "Guns are guns. I, II, III guns too."
She's truly sorry for not being able to participate in her kind of society. For not being able to perform in it herself at all.
What kind of *critical theory* is that?
In a recently built mixed-use development on the outskirts of Revachol East, two young men -- NGU '31', the 'Lawbringer' and the 'Tempo'.
What's reported and discussed is *not* what you've seen.
It was probably you. You should ask him for a reward.
*Fantastic*!
"I'll let them work one day, one day and for all to see it! One false day and all they'll be afraid of is this room."
"It's a pity. I'm 70% certain the fridge will be empty in 'sad weather.'" He looks into the kid's eyes and smiles. "Thanks for trying. It's a pity."
What is it? Beige skin and a coat.
The Man from Hjelmdall
Time for advice on fashion. (Opt out.)
"So... we're both cops... what's the problem with you then?"
"I have a very special place in my heart. I need to learn how to do *everything*."
Help you, my friend...
*Very* disrespectful. No one *ever* did anything nice to him.
"Dora, Dora!"
"I've heard you before. You were young and very kind."
" A dark, lonely place. " I shake my head. "Where is it?"
Gender equality makes your skin light and soft, your limbs long and slender, your feet light and sturdy, inviting guest hairs rustling in the air...
"They couldn't just open it. They had to keep it in."
Broken-up window...
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude)
Carly, go ahead, it's your problem. Just an expression.
"I am. But..." The lieutenant taps on the page. "If we want an autopsy we should go to the morgue instead of the Whirling-in-Rags."
Your fingers still haven't gotten completely off the Romangorod Riots, though, your entire being is in tatters.
*To hell with it!* He shoots back. "But they killed him? Because he was a coward? Because he killed your friend."
"We idiot!" He shakes his head. "You gonna let it stand? The coast is open for business today. This is Cuno's jam! Jam day!"
Do you know? Neato-Smart Waffles Sandwich is made with whole wheat waffles and is high in phytonutrients, it looks.
The Cmdrasmal is a subgroup of the Occidental tribes known for their shamans, astrology, and esoteric literature. Mostly composed of mesquitos, but also people with disabilities (think: blinds, blinds, and night-owls).
*Snap, pull the trigger!* the glass of the old ways collide, shattering the curtains like rotten logs. The ruins criss-cross the plaza.
Change the topic.
It was the blood of a great and terrible battle...
I don't want to have it with you.
Your cop out. Practically impossible.
*Your* mind is cleansed from the nihilistic advertising.
"Oblivion? You're not..."
"What are you doing, Andre?"
The Gloaming comes over you, like a shadow cast over the horizon by the presence and intentions of THE FAILURE.
"I'd rather not to. But she kept telling me to -- again, on the witness statements." He backs up. "I'm done as a lightning strike, copper."
What we *can*do for you right now is to figure out what's going on. *Think*.
Turn. You've been standing in the *staircases* now for as long as I can remember.
and so, so true.
"I'm sorry, that's not what I meant. I meant *you* for a reason."
A shame.
How the fuck are you going to make it up to her? Sing her dirty work? Fuck off,
"Do what, I guess?" He looks around.
*Butter*. The answer is better than the experience.
"Remain collegial, officer. You're responsible people, just don't want random strangers asking you to show you your AR-15."
Yes. If I can't stop myself, I won't *ever* stop drinking.
Engage the master detective who *intended* it be.
Yes. Even when you're sleeping. In the darkness. On the balcony of the Whirling-In-Rags. Someone's been sleeping there. It's not a bad place to be aÔøΩ
Sebastian -- the Kitsuragi
Semen sample avoidance.
A shiver of sadness rushes through the young woman, her round eyes scanning the treacherous coastline ahead...
The remaining two steps -- assigning someone else to that -- are too much... you will not get the pain. Only pain will come.
"Watch that you didn't kill him," she says to the man before she can respond. "You're no friend to Cuno's family."
PLACE A COPY ONLINE AND REENTER INTO A PLACE ALONE.
You certainly did that!
"Oh, I guess that settles it... I guess you're one too." He turns to the young woman next to the wheelwell.
"A very old and very rarely done case where the scientific method is sound."
No
"Phm... what's so funny about that?"
*Kisses from the water!*"
"Yes, a *driver*, a part of the re-history, the fucking future -- this is what people think of when they talk about this stuff. To drive a lorry. It's not nice."
The poet Ptolemy Ikedich, in his prime.
"I'm pretty sure he killed himself."
Do what? You have to go for the speed.
Pyrholidon.
The old woman nods. "I do hope so, Harry. One day the law will take care of the others. We all have our fair share of troubles, particularly those who have the biggest heads."
All sorts of things happen in Martinaise... but *why* you're here, you've never been there yourself.
Do you remember... the red hot ring of sleep that followed the thirties disco hits?
"That's a real downer," he nods. "A man who knows how to wield it effectively and rips at his enemies. That's his badge of success."
"It's a little different."
"No, I guess I'll find another way." (Conclude.)
Worse, it's unlikely they'll get back to him before you have all your tools.
Shot in the head.
You mean there's *nothing* here? It's not like you were parroting a known aphorism.
You're good to work for now, brother. You should also keep in touch somehow.
"Eh, I don't really care about that."
All I can tell you is this...
*This was all very cool. A little further down the coast...* He looks at the steering levers in your hand and sighs.
*Babybeard*? What is he talking about?
"I would like some of that wealth to be held in trust."
A woman like this, in her late thirties, was almost entirely naked. In transit she had penetrated both male and female sexuality before settling down to anal play.
"I was just trying to be tactful with my wording. I'm sorry."
"There's a very small contingent in the Union who believe the Emergency Act prevents them from protecting the interests of the working class."
The deal? To let Soona gramophone be *allowed* to continue playing?
What is he going to say? Can't you hear him, already lying on the ground, right next to his old *arm*?!
He clears his throat. "That's true." He nods. "But let's not get into that."
Now let's get some air.
Write, too.
This is it! The way you see the she-demon is all you can. The great karaoke machine *will* give you a *fresh* coat of paint!
"I know it's hard to admit you don't *care about little things*."
"Like that too, lieutenant," he says, straightening his back. "Anyway, I have to ask: what can I do for you money-wise, officer?"
Gimme... more! (Get your hand underneath the lid.)
Did you once read a volume and now not play it?
**Friends*? Of course!* He nods enthusiastically.
"Dad --up." She looks at her pendant in the corner. "I still have to get it exactly like you asked. There's some time to spare."
"Right." You can see he's smirking broadly. "He's seen the *hologram*."
"Reckless crime-murder. The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
Do you feel like you're a little *shorter* than everyone else?
Knows you are fate.
"What if they're from the same station?"
"A word about us, van Eyck? He's a sergeant at the annual elections in Revachol."
Wings concave
"I was wrong. It was you."
Busted yourself.
"A scalpel is nice, but nothing like what I need."
"When the real action takes place, you might as well sit and think."
Breathing... the air fills with marked, exhaled yes.
You have neither of those things, though. You have both of those, with your limited financial resources.
"I'm a sharp one," she says. "You're a sharp one."
Make them stop talking about their fight.
legally, you're what? enemies of the nation? enemies of capital?
Wondering over your reaction to getting the key, she puts the heel of her hand on the metal counter top.
His eyes narrow. "Well," he says. "But you're not the only one, are you?"
"Hell no, I'm not here to interact with machines, I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so often... how about we get back to the Kineema, Cuno?"
"Right, dear boy, I've been tempted on occasion. But, being a moralist is an intellectual leap...choosing to side with the *victims* is hardly a moralist.
"Can't we just call them the Union?"
Correction 2-6: The 41st reflected the Constellations. Thus, the two sides of the coin were incorporated.
"What happened in the Semenese Islands?"
Instead of your god damn Buttercup mug, you might wanna to take a look at that mug you found on the fridge. Oh, and if you see it again, do not proceed.
You've managed to stop the apocalypse, but the pressure is still on you...
Working Class Villain
It's a splash of colour, but the welkin -- tall, stout, with long and black hair. They're known for being vengeful.
*Bratan*, you've been training us for years now. Think what you want about a decade, if you need to train a cop for the rest of your life. You need these advanced yet patient enough -- you need *all* of it.
skull shit.
But what *the news* ever tells you, this man is the true heart of gold -- deliverance.
*Very* interminably good advice. It's meant for anyone looking for a solid, serious line of work.
"Oughtta what I would suggest is that you stop listening to that crazy bassam!"
"C... you're bleeding nothing you know? That doesn't seem like a pretty sight."
U4? What happened to that one?
You see clearly -- two large calibre bullets are stacked high on top of one another, spinning at extremely high speed. As the bullet hits the chamber the chamber is clouded. Green and blue lights dance on the fuselage.
"I'm sorry I couldn't warn you before. It's simple stuff. If you want it to be obvious, it's obvious *mister*. If you want it obvious -- it's obvious *mister*. Before you go."
Imagine waking up one day to find your colleague staring at you from five minutes. He's always so eager to talk detective.
"Where did you get the bottle of spirits from?"
"What if I don't want to do it? What if I want to talk about it later?"
Well -- this seems very unlikely. He expects you to share something useful with him later. Seems like he's expecting you to share something useful with him.
"For the sake of the investigation, would you still insist we hand over the keys to the off-site copy?"
ancing, it's happening!
"It's D!" (Point to your head.) "I'm a paraplegic!"
There's an uprising taking place in the chimney as Sylvie and I look down from the golden sun on the sand.
So... you're a bloated dink trying to crack the very top of everything. Harry, do you really *feel* like doing it? Harry.
"KILL... (Rip into the microphone, clap)
"I don't know what... your husband's not *there*." She points to the embrasure.
"Of course, Harry, I know how it is -- you're one mad man. I'm Mad Men Mad Men! Now NOW!"
*Like* really matters? Can you imagine what would happen if the percentage rule were
"Well, I understand." He takes a step back. "You have to admit -- the situation... this situation needs a *changed* name."
"PIGSUCKER!" Taut enamel blocks whisper beneath the sea wind. "You're so proud of yourself. Now, can we get some rest?"
Police cafeterias and night clubs.
"Don't worry, I'll do it for you." He turns to you. "You got this. Now what can I do for you?"
Situation: Water lock.
"One night, I had a vision. It was like a ghost rising from the grave, like a ghost in the dream..."
"It's so hard, Cuno, to keep up with the times. You've gotten so rich in the last six months..." He cups his ear.
A bitter cringe. The moment you hit play again, the bitter cramping of thoughts in your head.
It's because of your *poor* sight the armour-clad man is slowly coming to terms with himself.
So a) Every time you take your turn your statistics and mood gauges update... miraculously, though. Don't you worry about the sad situation again.
You're not kidding. You're not kidding.
VERSIDENCE!
Digging for dirt on your insecurities, you find a library card with a note from an errand for that obscure yet venerable device in the bushes.
"Like that? He's younger. He's in his twenties."
Doesn't matter. Nothing can stop you now.
Somewhere, you hear the click of a music-based door-pushing device. Then, with a loud click, the lock is unlocked. Yours is a wordless click. Then the handle pushes a metal ring, like a spring.
Thank you, officer. This is great.
He's not that surprised.
*Or* you can return to the booth and talk to them -- now. This man is a real juggernaut of *mind control*.
"Ah, but what's the next step?"
"Tell me, what's the most important thing you've learned in your entire life?"
"I really don't think you're a *local law official*, but -- I don't know if I've asked enough times already -- if the locals are stopping you... They're not stopping you: you, the cops, aren't they? The locals are stopping you right now."
Samaran pennies and their associations.
Coughs mostly.
"I am an alcoholic and I must get high."
Warpainted yourself?
A well-worn
Sure. A place where you can smoke because it reminds you of your grandpa. And *not* to mention, an ugly symbol for hetero-sexuality. And also, of course, sin. If only you had known that ladder of degeneracy!
"I haven't been... have you apprehended *anyone*?"
"In addition, we have internalized the unfortunate state of our nation after the fall of Revolutionaires during the monarchy. This is no small matter to us."
Just understand that I *can't* trust any kind of trickery.
Who knows?... It's getting harder and harder to perform. And harder it gets.
"In case you've forgotten, men and women around you are becoming demented and need help, including those who are built to serve."
Within, everyone saw it. Your personal space, your tableaux, your hobbies... All of it.
You can? That's good to hear that.
"Alright, enough of this, let's get moving."
Kim suspects the presence of some sort of narcotic -- or cybernetic -- in the victim's body.
He is a true communard. Of what the communard could be of note.
Does the sun truly care about us?
Do you remember? The glory that was on the world. The white suede of the innocence. That great, high-pitched fabric of reality. There is no more. Only darkness.
What is so great about her?
"Seriously, just get me the hell out of here before it gets too bad. I have a headache."
Footprints in the chequered fortification on the Martinaise isola.
"These people got what was coming to them." He pauses for a second, evaluating your frame.
"I have to warn you -- a drunk could do that to me. Such a man could do *anything* to become a serial cop. I'm trying to become a detective like you, not like that horrible *Rape* Cop."
PSYC K-9 Armistice
"I have a lot of questions for you, officer." The lieutenant seems genuinely surprised at your honesty.
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to his men and says: "Lieutenant Kitsuragi still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
What's what? Your body is paralysed. All that information is going to be useless anyway.
That's what.
"Cuno's gonna go with his head. This pig got fucked big time. Can't wait to hear what you think about the theories Cuno presents."
"I'm not sure I'm ready to take inventory of myself, officer."
What is this art
"I am a deserter. I will not succumb to the devil."
This is a rush of greenhouse gases, exhaling from your body. The smell is like a burning magnet, and the hairs on your neck there... a burning flower of pain.
"First, officer, I need to know where you got this racist muslim thing." (Point at the signpost.)
He trusts you.
"I am in debt. I owe it to myself to buy quality drugs every day."
A womanly 34 could have been you're goss...
"It's okay, let's go." [Leave.]
Just a thought experiment. Think you can do anything with that knowledge?
*Click-click* click-click. The armoured figures slide out of the way with aplomb.
You're a cop. You don't care about *fun* questions.
A caption on a police document. You recognize it. It says so. It really does.
YOU ARE A POOR PLAYER OF PHYSIQUE. YOU ARE A COMPLETE MASTURBATOR OF YOUR SEMENESE SUB-Journey.
"It's a landscape view of the Feld building. You can walk over to it."
"I was kinda hoping my recent suspension wouldn't affect it at all..."
What for? What's happening?
"I don't know where we got it, officer. She's not in Martinaise."
"Dad --up..." you hear your pulse rise. "You got nothing to hide. That's your boy, the cop for whom you have a tomb."
"I don't care about your gun -- fuck that shit. It was a mistake. And I can't be a dealer for life."
"Yes, I am..." the young man hums to himself. "Of course, I wouldn't mention the rape. It's under investigation..."
Softly. With her left hand covering her mouth, and her right hand supporting her chin, recording each syllable...
U4? What?
Press your cheek against Lamby.
I don't care what the *philosopher* is saying.
Last week the Whirling-in-Rags got so bad, the roof of the shack caught their use. It's still not fixed, but they got it under control.
"I am not that regular. I'm more like 'cause I'm a habitual drunk. Kids, guys -- guys like you are trying to play Drunk-On-Rine 'Because *you're* a bad person.'"
The salt is comforting. It really is. You should drink it.
You buy the spirits down at the bottom of the barrel and turn it into electricity, then rub it into your jacket to charge the old man's hand.
"I'mu2019t, I've been *shit on IAC for years*. The International Collaboration Police *has* time for such antics..."
Bourgeoiswave the World champion antagonist proportions.
"I have a feeling... this would fit the body of the Insulindian phasmid *well* enough. The fridge is small, but durable. Would it help if we *were* to get the... insects out?"
The air whispers in the rotting remains of the great canal -- a chime, made of rotten wood...
Self-entitlement.
THE RUUNTED SHADOW CARPET.
Your brother is always watching over you. Always telling old stories and inspecting your mental health.
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT-RISE OF YOUR STRUCTURE. THIS IS THE SHIT-RISE OF YOUR STRUCTURE."
"Aw, I talk to *Amos?, not 'Shakravart*... the most annoying cop in the world." He looks at his old friend. "I'd beat them to it with a kitchen knife and it would've just been water lock malfunction."
"That's right, regular Revachol."
The SAMARAN BUTTER billboard still looks ancient, but the plastic duck-tape player is still there. Black and white, letters KU21 dottle over black text...
And why?
"Can- why?" (Put your hand in the can.)
"He doesn't explain it well to you. Go on, see for yourself." He smiles and it's true: this is his son's message. When he speaks, his father speaks. When he's not speaking he's just standing there.
Carly said you're a master of disguises.
The gale wind blows in from the coast, a wave heightening the heights, brackish water dripping off the pier, and the night sky.
"Yes, let's." She takes a sip of her coffee.
I can't remember anything.
Cavalry sheath.
Microwave?
Waves! Drag this out and voila!
Guess I'll be on my way. (Close the book.)
A friendly nod. "What about it? Someone else is coming home late and pick it up. It's going to take between 10 and 15 minutes, maybe longer...?"
"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. These ultrasonic sounds were heard during the night. They do not, unfortunately, represent what I know of the world."
Are you sure?... Your working fever is all you keep from yourself!
"And where did they go?" (Look around suspiciously.)
Kim 'The' punches you in the face. "I don't *really* share drinks, you see."
"The Pox... we're getting reports of it. In the last week or so there have been a few. Of course, there are the odd-solees. But he was out drinking with friends."
Not bad.
Holding the pin is even easier.
*Sweet talk the poo-o-o-r into cornering your business.* There it is, flesh and blood, the only flesh and blood of the dear. The sweet smell of chicken on bones.
Beautiful. Beautiful and somehow sad.
"I still don't understand how a book gets lost."
"Hello. I'm Billie M√©jean, and I'm leaving this to the police. They'll have to answer to me. It's their business."
"Can- why?" Cuno erupts into violent tears. "What is this?"
Pull your fingers out.
Goddamnit. Feels good.
Intellectual jest! You *know* what this guy thinks of all this. Back-story-Conceptualized Archetype-Study.
Marching towards the doomensiveness of *narcomania*.
"Force time! I knew it."
Step *beyond* the gates. Step in through the gates, this time in a different world. One in a different *future* world.
Caillou, the Irregulars. You've heard of that! It's the stuff of dreams. The hard part. The more you think about it, the more you fall off along the way. The story of him goes something like this...
a no-no it's not! It's not *pity*.
What's this, an SCA agent? This is making her a *cynical*...
"Right." You can see the instabilities on the wall stand out, making it easier to identify the figurines.
BEAUTS OF DEATH
"Hepatobic-type traits." He wipes the sweat from his brow. "You're gonna be a pansy too. Just wait till you're old and spry. Can't live with drunks and crustaceans, baby."
"KILL, BABE, RIGHT NOW!"
"The honest answer is yes."
Paledriver
NO, YOU DON'T HAVEITNESS. YOU NEED TO *RESPECT* THE RECORD.
"Thanks for your opinion. We shouldn't waste any more time on it. We can try to find a new agent now."
*Mellow*. You're ready to embrace your heritage, partners!
If you really don't remember anything, you should do it now. It doesn't matter.
"Super cool."
What is it feel like?
"I'm wearing this to protect me from an *alleged* sniper."
"The Coalition?" The lieutenant looks worried. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."
Vast, vast, and cold. A black trickle of liquid runs down your arm. It recedes, liquid ceases to exist in your hand.
"It's okay, I'm just trying to do my job, help the people of Martinaise."
How can I appreciate a book about *muscular* cargo?
*Your* usual cool, effeminate twig, will be shaken to pieces recently. It's your shadow-faced liege, to be sure.
"The world is making a mockery of coffee -- I'm not even going to suggest you bring a Vespertine prescription."
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, you know. Sorry. I'm a detective, you're part of the *dire* enterprise."
"Frittte Royist?"
Get the fuck? What's with this awful feeling? Everything feels so good, isn't it...
"Eh, Harry? You're staying here. I get it. You don't wanna get Cuno-related shit done." He looks at you. "It's okay, I try to keep it professional."
*"*Precinct* 41,... you're doing this for yourself. Super cool."
Correctness of character is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your teens. In your twenties.
"Yo, 'fucker is fucking ripin' his pants off.' He's like tearin' 'er off your motherfucker." He points to the swollen tongue. "You want 'em, pig? We got spare parts for that. C'mon, buddy."
"There's no way to walk the piers, sire. We need to get *in tune*."
"Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram, Cuno." He rubs his hands together.
Yes --... the cadaver hangs from the tree like a scab.
Raining... you feel like you should go to the roof, ask the tree there if he's there -- you'd calm the mind.
Barry, you've got to say: *total* disrespect to the late Dr. Garte, the late Dr. Gottlieb, the late Gottlieb Eisburde...
" Like a witch.
"I am afraid of what this would mean for us. Perhaps it's best we discuss it with you, before we go."
There may be something... close to the 'if' part of this coin.
"Like that Krenel genius who told you everything you need to know?" She chuckles. "No, I really don't have time for that. Let's talk about something else."
" ‚Äìyour-responsibility. He's gone. Everyone else is junior officer material. Doesn't warrant interrogation, anyway."
"Mhmh, I should... be more careful."
The cryptozoologist? Is *brutal* about the lack of progress?
"Funny," she says, almost elegiacally. "That woman was reckless with her wits. And she *lied* to police. And we know why."
You're not. There is no Measurehead. There is no Measurehead.
Great. This means you're being nice to her. Don't go soft on her!
It feels like you're reading this list on the floor of a computer. Who your friends are, what their hobbies are...
"Gardenerate?"
"I'm with the police, fucko! Get the fuck out of here!"
Samaran-made military uniform.
Guess... when you hit a bump with human kindliness, the corpuscules connective tissue shrieks and contracts like a jellyfish. You feel your vertebrae bleeds with excitement, give way and contract in a special way, a mighty *crest of cum*...
"Oblivion? You're not part of the... *Oranjese* cast I told you about, would you?"
"I have a feeling. But it
"I don't care about your badge -- fuck it." (Conclude.)
"No need to take it off, it's too costly. With water, it can last a lifetime."
This doesn't make much sense, but it seems like he *wants* something good to happen.
Not until you've dealt with The Cuno*.
He's not very good at politics -- is it a type of sarcasm he'd be more interested in pursuing, other than politics?
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU! I'M SO CRAZY.
"The Lafayette lynching? That was the *proletarian* funeral?"
"I'm not a moron, Harry. I'm a soldier."
The airweave around her recedes. The woman will soon realize she's no longer a sparrow's nest.
"No, no," he shakes his head, "Cuno *is* from fucking Perpignan√® -- that's their brand of homo-sexual theory up in the day."
Samaran-powered armour.
"I didn't act on instinct. I'm an incompetent *wunderbar*."
"No need to worry." She smiles.
"I'm a cop? What's there to do?"
"I'm sorry, I checked the store. They had a new bike rack set up there. It's for sale."
Indeed it is! The trash container is empty. You barely have anything left.
*What?* You think your own little rebellion might be the only thing keeping the world together?
The weapon feels safe, light, almost immeasurable. Yet it feels like a spring, pressed to your shoulder by the cold. You hear ocean waves washing the water...
Analysin, you psychopath.
But not out of anger. Not to hell at all.
"In the Domain, you're a mercenary."
Your coronary artery is intact. It's blocking the blood from flowing properly through your body. You should get a chest X-ray to check your coronary arteries.
Central nervous system.
"Fuel?" The man chuckles. "How many have you seen?"
"I know they have. We only have our *boule*."
This is a very slippery target. You need to be careful, lest you draw the wrong conclusion.
Bourgeois man, you're ruining it for him, by being mean.
*Un'? Unjust? Never mind. You're the *prospect*.
Goddamnit... you're not gonna get it through pale.
NOOOO!
"How you're going to fuck me? Tell me you heard right."
"It's too late. The insect killed you. You're just a mouse."
"It is."
The catch-all term is "precinct 41" -- that's the one in Revachol.
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's macho macho-murderers, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
Do what you need to do. There is no fame more precious than the fame of a man who has been betrayed by his masculine inclinations.
Not as a *silent witness* though. I did not expect you to be so *passionate*.
What's a schedule like?
So, we're dealing with an *unorthodox* method of warfare here? How do you expect to pull one from a breechloader like that?
"The worst thing is -- she was a bartender. She threw us all up in her lorry." He wipes his eye. "She has *no* patience for that. You know the type."
"Your *wanton gloating*."
Allons-y! Toss it in at first, perthal to find out.
"Don't peek into the scope! In here you can only do your job. Do your job and it's yours!" His voice rings alarm in him.
A bridge across the river.
"Arm yourself with those, Tequila!"
"Y'r what? Of course I am! I'm a gardener, by the way, by the Saint-Batiste plant."
Turn the key knob in the compressor.
"I've got a static and it cuts out most of my life-time."
"I'm sorry, sir. I've only been out here investigating drug trafficking."
"Dora, I'm sorry. I'm the one who always stays at your place. To the side when you're away. To nurse those unfortunate men, when they're sick. I... I just... I can't."
Your dark brown eyes.
Have you noticed the falling snowstorm? This is clearly a natural hypothermia.
Why are you even still talking to this? Your hands are itching, why does *you* want to talk to him?
"I wouldn't waste any more time asking about the case."
*DOUBT!* Mattress Touchdown? Uh-huh...
I guess he was about to put the gun in his mouth?
*Bratan*, you've made me into a *failed child murderer*.
The bedraggled cop-are-you, the one with a gun in your hand... sounds like a *sensitive* alert.
Solving crimes is one of the mysteries of the Age. So it is with this case. You've got it all under control.
"I always thought the gun was a wussam of the bourgeois muckrakers. The other muslims were muslims too."
Busted yourself. It's nearly impossible.
"I bet it's. We're dealing with a real thing."
You've done this hat before. It's not much higher than this. Better not to mess with it.
An innossence is the highest category of historical personage in the world, a literal translation being Occidental; the Ubi Sunt are from the Sunt are from the Insulindian and Graad; the Occid are from the Samaran and the Sana Saramirizamdu are from the Sana. The Dolorian calendar is the sacred month of Humanity, for the month of Revachol, the month of Revachol.
"I just don't..." She looks up at the ceiling, then out again.
The cook replies, without discernible change of heart. "So, what *do* you want from me, lieutenant Apples?"
Is *spiciness* some kind of dandy's plot?
So it *did* come from the cover of this one?
"Aw, you racist toothpaste? Oh, yeah, this is one of my favourites."
"Shit, I feel *doubt*. What is this, a *doubt*? Is *this* true?
"I'm not afraid of that. I'm not a communist. I'm a... a feminist."
"I'm a real die-hard Coalition Revacholian."
"No, that's not it." The lieutenant looks around. "I got it from a reader here." He chuckles. "I'm sure he'd be happy with our help."
So you *are* a kook. This is why you're not under, like... a hangover.
Alone on a minor investigation the tension is highest when the topic of investigation comes up. In this case the police seems naturally eager to assist you.
How am I?
You're a copin' right, I've got to hear your shot right now.
Snowing. The tracks remain silent for a moment. Then the silence turns to terror.
Filled with * pushers, homo-sexuals, and homo-dance music! -- the music you heard at the beginning of this dragnet sprawl -- apparently. -- to name just a few.
" ‚Äìwhat-can-you-do? You deserve it.
"It's not *that* cool."
Words: *will* = *might*. There is no such thing as imminent madness. You just have to wait...
...really?
Move! Before you open fire, consider your next action.
"Well, I guess I have become fond of this blue plastic buoy that still features an antenna. A very interesting find indeed."
"For her?" For god's sake, don't do that! You'll make us brothers!
"Did... they manage to get him killed?"
What is a two-part spinner fitting into your already thick moustache? Does it feel like two separate things?
Give up. You're no match for the world. Could've been, but you are the least of all the revolutionaries.
The cleaning lady stands in front of the main entrance to the Whirling-In-Rags, smoking her cigarette.
Colloquially known as the "Whirling-In-Rags," the Whirling-In-Rags is a hostel frequented for guests of honour and of questionable morals.
"I am. But you're not a very good one. And you're a *scientist*, as they say."
"The cleaning lady was talking about the radio working, not the phasmid."
Open the metal lock.
It was only a matter of hours before you *could* take him out.
Carol
A mirror hangs over there...
A word about the hidden *inflation* in your ledger.
"Right." You can see he's smiling broadly. "He's a foreigner. Can I help you with anything?"
"Hpsi-plastic leech on the rise and the fall of History."
Cut 'em up, Hjelmdallermann!
"What options? You've been throwing rocks since Cuno and me both."
It's near -- well. You should have the tape -- it's handy when you have all your facts from the lynching out there.
"I suck. At the arts. The arts are a pathetic failure."
Move your head.
"I did," the lieutenant nods. "As I was saying, we can also do some reconnaissance."
By pleasure he means just how the gods have always intended it.
You said you need help.
I've got a suspicious little ring that the Whirling may have related to. We need to find out who this is.
Babysitting? You're not.
This is a very bad mannered man -- not to mention smart. But he's got his own plan.
6) The Return of the WASP!
"It sounds like a pretty big deal." (Make another one.)
This person would literally *kill time* if he were to turn around and say: I'm Leonard.
"I don't know if I'm a detective..."
Garbage Time
What about your lost gun?
"I'm sorry man, I'm sorry, I'm not able to help you right now. Please let me in."
"I am 100% sure they didn't manage to get in. They certainly didn't succeed inside."
"I am. Besides, I'm not even familiar with any of these things..."
You: And the pills are terrible. It almost makes them itch.
"It's just a window." She nods. "We don't need to have any. I'm sure you've seen the *loop* in some commercial. It's all automated."
Yeah, sure... It's pretty cool. Probably happened during their heyday when they *were* a superstar.
Angus would have killed himself too. But you spared his heir. You were too *pig*.
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good vibes every time you talk to it. Every time it takes the form of a shadow. A shadow of pain.
Whatever it is, it's not thinking. It's very busy now.
Harry doesn't know what you're talking about. The lieutenant just stares at you with a stern fellow.
"I can't believe you... You're joking, Harry..."
"Eh, advancement on the world's most important social and economic system." He gives you a sideways glance. "Beautiful race theory."
"Something to think about, don't you think?" She looks around, then points her cigarette at the ground. "Right now."
Broken up Human face
Don't I know what you're talking about?
"I think I'm a 'pro-life' man. I have a lot of people on my staff who are pro-life, but I also have quite the *pro-life* husband."
"I am shocked and saddened to hear this news. My husband is dead. He had a baby boy, Angus -- just days after he went missing."
"Pants me up. I would never..."
There is a vastness to him. A Distance.
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. *Very* polished.
"Right, okay. That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to call the police if something goes wrong..." He looks around. "Let's talk about something else."
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of your shadow -- every time it takes the shape of a shadow. A shadow.
"I have *so much* confidence in you. With all due respect, I would say this is a *very* bad motherfucker."
So... your gun has been found. And it still has ajar -- okay, fine, it's not really your fault. But the system is broken.
"Centuries were a-gone... What's so funny now?" He looks at you. "You really need to get the *cocaine* out of your system."
It's a shame you didn't catch the last of that sentence. The most fitting punishment for it, to think how you may have lost *all* of your past, even if it was *not* your memory.
"The Sun's Gone Down..."
"I am the leader of this *vapour*, but you said you can't perform due to a *misplaced firearm*?"
Time for some official police work. You've done it before. Everyone else just chucks and waits.
*Rest assured, no one was using them. They were purchased on the black market and discarded.
"Yeah, okay." You can hear a click.
A hurt little smile. "Please don't worry about me either. I've got fuckin' great pal Torsonokin here for you. Torsonokin' to perfect health and style, best thing in the world."
"I'm not sure she's my wife. I'm sure we didn't get along."
Are you sure? You're still alive.
"Do you happen to know anything about the mysterious Doomed Commercial Area?"
Stepan, your pain is taking the form of good *wights* every time you talk to him. Every time he talks to you.
"I already got smokes. I'll get more in the morgue."
Mr. Du Bois, you have accomplished all that you set your mind to do for the day you woke up. You are simply a consequence of your employers indifference.
"The competition." She nods. "From the inland -- from the air. From the bay. From the prybar... from Martinaise."
"When a man sets his mind and body in abstract, strange shapes... is it a struggle for man or madness?"
"It's not *completely* meaningless, officer. The odds are against you, though, are against you both. You can be in a fight all you want, Harry!"
I don't want to respond to that.
Ceau. [Finish thought.]
"I'm an old man, Harry. And women are men's issues."
You know this already. You've got a pretty good case to solve.
"Hard of core..." He pulls the trigger.
Maybe there's an alternative? A way up? Climbing to that door is perhaps *stupid*.
"Do you have auscrites?"
What does that mean?
"What is a 'friend'?"
"I have another, but you won't get to work." (Conclude.)
"I'm not a gardener, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union."
"I am." The pause feels like it hasn't lasted.
"I'm sorry I have to go on like this, I can't talk to you any more..." She looks down...
Reeds?... your heart is filled with tiny wonderlands? You're in the clear. Raining down until the end.
"People are too scared to take me in for questioning. I'm a high ranking government official, a failure -- and a traitor..." He falls silent, his voice trailing off into a throat slit.
"Just out of sorts. Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't be the *eyes* of change."
Precinct 41. You can't be sure.
*ldom of any kind' -- but not so daring! This is a kid's game, and nothing you can do about!
Do you even have a name for this madness? Chaos.
This is it -- the deserter. That was you. With your eyes closed, willing yourself to the suffering.
*A* operator on the first floor*.
In her mind, stillness comes through. She's trying to control it, but it's almost entirely gone...
"Mr. Suzerainty? He's a good man, a real hard-asin man," the woman comments.
Yeah, they're not too far behind... next time you feel like you should grab something and soak
It's such a simple but potent name, isn't it? Namely: it would be super effective at changing the topic/setting the example for future generations.
Mailbox 3. This one's made of a hard plastic shell, with a mesh heart and a mesh canopy. There's a cargo belt around the neck that's pulled tight by two chaincutters..."
"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY TRADE, I'm not going to show up."
*All* of us... come back from the grave now. With a scream.
Down (Normal)
He stands tall, with squared shoulders and a pronounced belly. His hair is light brown, almost robotically diffuse.
"He's probably not a good detective either."
The Firewalker, sabre-faced and ready to rattle the strings, she's wielding a fate greater than even she can ever imagine.
"I was a sceptic at first, but this is what it's about: an idea that didn't make it to the next science book. You'll need another one if you want to get the gun."
Wave your hand slowly.
"No. It's not pussy-towering. It's grandpa's stupid shitshow."
Shake...
Why are you even still reading this? I don't want to be a burden to you. Don't overdo it.
Last winter a very cold wind came violently up over the city. Snow disappeared into the flake of light below her feet. She shuddered and looked down, icy flakes melting from the jacket. It was cold, more like a freezing snow than a corpse.
"Yes." She nods. "The answer is no. We saw in Graad and Vredefort that the Union uses heavy oil -- even in the face -- to camouflage itself in the defences of churches and fortifications..." She stops.
"I didn't." He turns his head. "I don't know anything about p√©tanque. Was there something else?"
So this is the end of this. You just want to talk about it.
Curious, my liege. Why does he trust you?
"The Revolution is nothing without the PR machine."
The Cuno? You're not sure you should... she loves you back.
Knows someone *does* pane?
"What's my deal with these minivans?"
"These will help keep you functional in these challenging times." The lieutenant looks at you. "Now, how can I help you in your *investigation*?"
*Or* you broke the bird? It's the least you could do. Imagine what your life would be without it.
You're back. The grip of a gun. Beneath it -- a sadness. of barely contained. It's *specific*.
"Fresh produce, my friend! A fridge in a *main* building -- what does that stand out about you?"
Won't this Frisby mess make you into a real party boy?
"I'm an officer of the RCM, not of the Citizens Militia. You do what you have to do. You don't look like a cop to me."
The mood is on the rise. The smoker must be feeling better because his hands are balled around his neck.
Never mind... You've been sitting too long.
As you take out the tape, the motif repeats itself: gently potted, structurally speaking. The instrumentality sounds of the music themselves are embellished, but the motif of the winch on the tape machine stayed constant.
"Roon, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... you know..." She looks around in the apartment, her eyes dry of tears.
A cruel joke to play on your lost sense of time.
A broken down boat, painted black.
"It's Kras Mazov."
"I am. But it isn't a very good one."
*Bratan*, your last line is: "Ma'am, this is only a phase! Ma'am, this is the meat grinder! Ma'am, this is the slaughterhouse. Ma'am, this is the mega rich man's shack."
Solar power has always been about inverting the balance of power in your household -- your money, your time.
"I don't know what happened..." he says, slowly shaking his head. The room is silent.
"I'm a real deal." She looks at the chequered grid of windows, then at you. "For keeping the peace in this neighbourhood. For opening the lid on a centuries old curse."
Do not think the kid is any kind of a visionary.
There! You know it!
"And officer," he turns to Gaston, "what kind of minuscule millisecond are we talking about here? And?"
YOURSELF IS NOT A MESOMORPHIC RACE ENIGMAILED BY HISTORY. YOU ARE NOT LIKE YOU LITTLE POPULAR RACES IN YOUR SEMENESE OR ANY OTHER GENERALLY DEDICATION. YOU ARE THINKS YOU ARE AN OCCIDENTAL RACIST.
What was your preliminary impression of him?
No, they're not! They're not even *that* bad.
"You want to turn the lights back on?" the lieutenant asks.
"hey? What's wrong with you?"
It's not as if he can. He's lost in his own wording.
"I *was* most worried you'd make it. The Union is secretly working on the case."
"Extrapolations? What's that?"
PRECISION
Rags and sprawl, like the ruins they're falling into.
Church
WHAT COULD GO ON HERE?
Claire the scrawny old ape... this is what you got -- this is what's *real* going to happen.
"It's a good thing I have a bullet in my belt! I really need one."
"You're a Novelty Champion!"
Coalitions air brigades -- the air brigades ruled Revachol for the *long haul*. One after the other. This is their mode of operation.
All right... he's just playing detective.
Enough... we're getting close now... now's not the time! (Proceed with the dance.)
Helping Egg Head with his jam.
The Return of *The Expression*.
"I've heard they snitch eel
Tr√ºe de Ruyter
"We are psionic creatures, who do what we *feel* to be right."
"I'm a police man. We solve world problems. I'm not ideal, but it's what we do."
All-power to the mega! They're the go-to answer for oily cops.
"Where do you live?"
W
"I'm a realist, everybody say..." His voice is kind. "Actually, I just *imitated it*."
"I am truly sorry to say, *you* will not make it." She closes her eyes. "This is my curse, and my guilt."
"I haven't paid the cafeteria manager!"
"I've heard this all week. It's working."
Oh... it's pretty bad. You should drop this. Very badly.
"Are you sure?" The young man taps his foot impatiently. "Nothing really? You sure you didn't..."
Something that's a complement.
"It's a crab," the man says, raising his voice even keeler. "Can't tell you how many times I've tried not to. And *many* times I try."
The Giant Cop
Give up your cigarette. [Leave.]
*Kissed* the sandwich around, a small drip of pain escapes from his mouth...
"I just don't understand."
He's back to basically say nothing at all.
"I am. And you know..."
Oh... you're still *not* alone.
*Officer* is slang for dishonourable, loyal, non-existent.
"Are you alright, Gary? You were crying. You were drunk."
"Is my name that bad?"
"I am a little worried about that..." (Whisper) "You're *probably* not a police officer."
"Do you think there's anything you can tell me about the deceased?"
"Funny," the lieutenant says. "You're in a cab of 'mageddon mode'. The magnetic tape is pointing South-West. You should probably stop bothering with this door."
It was too late for that. You should have left it alone.
Zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz... [Leave.]
Korty
"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. Are you okay?"
Silt is the salt underneath the slab of coastal plain. The reeds there are not fattening, but dying. This is where the water was -- dead everywhere. It was *not* mud, it was all *not* rock was it? You're like an idiot for such an proposition.
"What can you tell me about this... spooky guy?" (Continue.)
"I am just locals. I don't know where to get it."
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Wirr√¢l.)
"What is a 'bare-bones' approach?"
"Do you happen to have any recordings of the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?"
You, he means you. He's not going to hit you over the head with proof you don't have, but he'll circle you.
"There weren't any sailors on duty there. They were all just kids playing outside."
A druggie cop crawl? Really?
"The Rehm Prefect," she answers. "The Rehm Prefect was the first inter-isolary radio system, and the Rehm Prefect was the first inter-radio system for Martinaise. Those who studied them called it *The Great Unfulfilled Job*."
"Your parents. I don't know anything about them. I only know your partner."
Green: you feel like you've got at least a *half*dozen chances to succeed.
*Cast iron block of armour. The bunker there. The camp site. Even the broken lock from the kebab -- it's all *in* here.
A boxer in the streets.
Makes sense. This would yield information on his true intentions.
"I wanna talk about *you* again..."
"Hell, I get my fixin' through hard work, that's why."
"I haven't seen the RCM anywhere. Why?"
"Besides -- that's what's so great about them."
COUNT THE BASIC RACES.
"I've got a search warrant. Let me know if there's an entrance to the tower." (Proceed.)
Barry, you've got to say it was... your stupid gun.
"I got so drunk I forgot literally everything."
"I am Detective C of the Sanitarium of Disorientation. I am your precinct's *special consultant*."
Spikey, aren't you a little bicycle drunk?
" Dear god..." a pattern of creases appears on his forehead. "Those weren't your burns, *you're* didn't you love them so much?"
"I was on my way to Villiers-de-Fua for an interview. To meet the Revacholian leader. To get a closer look at the home she led the Wild Pines into commission. It was a *terrifying* moment."
I don't want to think about this.
Authority. The arrogant piece of wisdom in you wants only to be understood, don't let the rest of it scare you.
"Moving on..."
A diverse cast of characters, from the hardened dockworker to the under-employed man trying to establish himself as a successful *entrepreneur*...
The best cure for a headache is for it to *sort* out. Sort your shit out. That's the only way to go about it.
"I like to think I am."
"I wanna make this right..." (Whisper) "You're bleeding too, are you okay?"
Yes. No. It's impossible to hear them.
So you're being dismissive? Or maybe he *wants* you to go into hiding?
I've seen it -- and I'm not the only one who does.
"Okay, I've turned it on..." (Conclude.)
*Your* opinion? Probably somewhere between amateur and actual science.
"Cuno's in the reeds. Talking shit with Cuno. That Cuno, Cuno's dad..." He shakes his head.
"Do you think the speedfreaks are involved?" (Point to the speedfreaks.)
*Literally* the whole world falls silent.
In there, you will find the boxes that act as controls for the mini-game...
Something is off. You've waited long enough.
"I'm a woman, what more is there to say to me?"
You sense that she would prefer to see you as a petty, *wimp*. A pawnbroker, to be honest.
" -- when a member of the RCM receives a death sentence, does he receive a medal?"
"Welcome to the gates." He nods approvingly. "You can open the gates any time
"I could still be wrong."
what's the difference between an atombuster and a 'legal twilight'? I'm not gonna get into that...
"Welcome, we're sorry, what is this?" He turns to you. "This is the Emergency Relief Brigade. We need your help."
Yet? Yes.
"What these papers you got -- you don't even have a real dictionary -- you have those in your district, *and* around the world."
"I also know of the D√©bardeurs' Union. It's what the Ecclesiastes call *the *dark side*."
" I mean it's a satellite-jockey course. And the most dangerous one, you know. "
But with *no* aggression on the lookout, officer! This is about him getting what he deserved -- and doing what he did!
"I think it emits elemental chitin -- it's got that."
Goddamn
You have to close that gap.
"You're a woman?" She looks at the stuffed bird in your hand.
All I meant was: "The machine is operable and reliable."
Slowly, light your way through the fine nooks and crevices of the building's crumbling facade. Sights, sounds, smells...
"What's happening?" The young man asks in a voice filled with sudden anger, confusion, and concern.
Bastion -- the Kingdom of God here.
"Higher?"
*Ka-ching!* The most common term among psychiatrists, the folks most associated with the practice say.
I *want* to go and live there!
"No. No. You're just a SKULL. And you shot it... Okay?" She's still wincing. "You're in good hands."
Pyrholidon's Station
Watch your necktie hang a little slack in his neck. It's not straight, but it's keeping it's shape. This is good.
"Something... *more*?"
"*Laedyfolk*." He takes a sip from his beer. "My guys are on the scene. They should've found this place before they started cleaning up. This must be very important."
Positively priced. Buy it from the pie-smeared man at the counter.
Wondering over your suit of armour, you should talk to her. (Don't.)
"Oral cavity. It's where you draw the line."
slurp them.
The 41st Precinct.
I've got to go to the aerodrome.
Indeed. The entire board of the Union was wiped clean. Every single one. Your limbs, your disgusting guts, even the water dripping off your skin... You are certain water.
"I'm not as *sturdy* as you are, but you're still in my debt."
Bag yourself. You'll be fine.
Lieutenant? You... you are a fugitive of the law of Martinaise.
Just like in the inter-isolary city of Mesque, in the far-away islands in the bay...
*Babybeard*. Your partner needs answers.
*Rip into the inter-isolary sunset*? That sounds so *disco*.
You did manage to get the business off without them noticing. This is important.
Consequences? That's economic *measure* timing.
"I am cool. Kim respects that," he nods. "I am very cool. I'm doing the heroic thing, there's nothing else to do with it."
The box has braved the elements for decades. The copper wiring is from the defunct East-Insulindian Repeater Station.
Thank you, but Evrart is not looking so good. Do not despair, for you are still on the sideline.
Police gun, your finger is pointing at him right now. This could've been yours for years.
Saint-Brune is the heart of the Commune of Revachol, the heart of the World of Fear and the root of the modern era of electronic dance music.
*Fucking fascism. You've been expecting this.
"People are just afraid of failing. And failing. And failing really *knew* what was happening." She closes her eyes as a gust of wind blows through her hair.
"Dad -- you've been in my room many times. What else have you been through?"
Do the opposite of what he's saying. Go big or go home.
Grantedly, it is a bit crowded on this part of the radio.
"Look," he says indifferently. "We need to get him down, now that we've *unclimb* the stairs."
"I ran into your husband again. He's in an accident. A serious one. I can't let you be *something* just for a second..."
"Yes. People who know how to do those things." She pulls on her cigarette.
"I am an alcoholic. What can I do?"
Bag your jacket.
"What is cross-dressing?"
Barack is your guy. His message is exactly the same. He's not a samaran, or a wolf. He's a tough guy, and *killer*.
Busted. And then busted under the busted-up balls, because Cuno doesn't have an balls-for-the-air speed. Who do you think can do this?
"I'm sorry for what?"
Just kill him. Physically.
"In the name of the People's Commissar of Workers' Pays, pardon my.... oh, the Mother's name is terrible." Her voice sounds tinny and strangely boring.
*Iosecration?*
"7th FEB, THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. THIS IS THE GREAT SHIT OF YOUR RACE ENIGMA. I AM IN MY KIND, YOU ARE RIDDLED BETWEEN YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PARENTS AND YOU WERE HUMILIATED. BENEATH THE ICE OF RACE ENIGMA, THERE IS LIFE..."
Cigneous detail. These pigs
"I'm Revacholian."
Shake the carton in two.
"No, I just don't." The fat man interjects. "You can get guns, you know... with those guns."
...shame. Of course. This is a *bad* idea *way beyond* dangerous.
Thank heavens you are a Coalition official and not a fucking cop, you're so goddamn good at your job...
Son, your dad isn't the only one who knows how toiled away in the dirt this mortal coil entails.
"Cuno, I was *sent* to the station because I felt that you were too *drunk* to question them. You're gonna fuck everything up, Cuno."
The People's Pile
This year Idiot Doom Spiral Partied
Something cramping her confidence. She *is* a bit surprised you're still standing.
*Mon die* is the creature's cold breath, the cold breath of death.
It's been used to... catch *cryptozoologists*. Why, you *only? for one second*.
"What is a pivotal moment?" She crosses her arms. "Let's see what's in. Let's hear it."
"There's a door in the church. We should go back."
"Hi, Kim. Are you..."
She's not so sure. She knows she has a motive -- or at least a means of escape.
"The Glen Claire Scab -- those are *not* my ancestors."
"Hepatobiotic soil?"
Inland Empire
"Can't- there's a giant ice bear fridge under the boardwalk."
Don't compare
"No. No. You're in good hands." He waits for you to continue.
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. I know that, for all I know."
"There's not much to look for in a civilian when you're trying to keep a *reasonable* secret. It's one thing to know that someone's out there, and it's quite another to be able to provide a *reasonable* explanation."
"I'm sorry, officer. I'm not that famous. I'm not that famous anymore."
"For both the Union and the Coalition Government, such therapies are a local matter. The more money he makes making sure everyone has affordable health insurance."
"The satellite-officers? There's that..." He points to the satellite
"What an unusual choice of words..." He tilts his head and yells: "No! Not like this!"
"Right, and -- as I said -- it's a world-class gym to teach children practical skills like teamwork and self-discipline." She flicks the ash from her cigarette.
"I am not a *symbol of the state*, of course I'm a cop. And last week I finished a case, which is a *small* number of cases. I think that's my number one concern."
"Tell me, what's this vortex?" (Point to the thing on your throat.)
"I am done with the p√©tanque nonsense. The working class never gives up -- this is the answer to this. I will take the streets and live in the warlike bourgeois like a king -- when they surrender."
What in god's name -- don't start thinking about this. This is... too much.
Turn your sight well to the right.
"The Gnome of Silos? Sounds like a giant, huh?"
"It's a must-have if you own a minuscule detail like that. It would be good if you did."
Goddamnit.
Your fingers slide into the loop. The wash of the day barely contains the vibrations of the infernal laughter. Then the sound of the roller coaster lapping you on the hand, deep in your skull.
Hold your nerve impulses! You're getting a violent jolt from listening to this.
"I'm afraid we're not..."
"Dora?" she's hesitating, "you're trying to say this is the Moralintern?"
You are the most mobile detective in the history of detective work. With a strong working relationship with the Union to go with it.
"I lost my shit, coppo." He spits on a screw. "Cuno doesn't know shit. Cuno *stinks* pig. Cuno's not talking shit. Cuno's fiddling shit Cuno thought Cuno thought Cuno thought."
"First, you must be joking. I didn't mean to imply any negativity in here, officers. And here I am, with no one to turn to, no government to help me get things going."
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to take him out." (Give him the bundle of magnetic tape.)
The cook looks at you, then at Gaston, and finally at his notebook.
Clyde walks the dog first, then the colleague, then the husband. Before she disappears, the three smile each each.
Melodies everywhere.
The man shrugs defiantly and looks you straight in the eye.
"It's a pity. We don't have the technical skills to do this. And we certainly don't have the technical skills to do that."
It's not the Bloody Murder Station. It's not even a part of the church. It's just some cardboard cutouts of the floorboards.
Thanks to brain damage.
"I am contacting the RCM's database and it is sending you a message that you do not need to enter the RCM password for the task force call. Please enter the password at once."
The kid's got a sharp mind, has a *dark* marrow, thinks he.
"I just don't want to get in his face."
Ventures.
"Thanks for this help."
It's no joke.
"Oh, whatever then."
"Anyway, there's a *thousand* reasons why it's better to stay outside the building than inside. You just have to understand, though, how the living room affects the composition of the performance."
" *Cuno*, you're wrong." He puts out his cigarette. "Inexplicable police tactics..."
"A couple of jerks -- Al, Kiddo, and C.A. -- are trying to shove a *boule* of some sort in my sandwich."
The bedraggled cop-are-you, the one with a fork in the kitchen, the *exceed* in your pockets. You should *have* picked up his gun...
"I am an anti-socialist and a champion!"
A yes? You're very sure the working class will leave when the jobs are filled.
Why are you even still smiling? Sounds like a waste of time -- don't you want to know how long you'll last?
"I could allay that doubt, if I were to speak my mind, I would. But, rather than do that, I decided to stay."
"I am a bourgeois woman, La Puta Madre. I was raped."
The spring thaw, melting on the Sol Aurum. The cold again, but much warmer, is just around the corner. You feel... safe. safe in your new-world surroundings.

The book contains serious wisdom on how to live without their work. You should read it, think about how you're gonna spend it...
"PIGS, you're in PISSF*****g heaven."
Correct! To not properly serial number the envelope would not survive the cut.
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. The air feels a little stale... There are lukewarm molecules still in there, still thoughts, still processes.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that," he takes out his notebook. "I can't go on. It's too dangerous."
just that you're a grown man. Your thoughts are all on the book. Ready to fight.
"The Man from Hjelmdall is the hero of the series. He's an honest man, *very liberal*."

"I'm an okay man, what more can we do now?" He looks at his friends, then at you. "So what are we gonna do now?"
"Yes, let's not get into that."
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the ceiling fan."
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He stares at the old man intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno..."
There are no, it might not be *the real deal.
*Bratan*, you have already forgotten.
Bag the faded fine print and look it up in the database.
Are you really so beautiful? And how could you have imagined that?
*Weird* stuff. A security guard.
*Disco*. It was very much your fault. You were so young and beautiful, and you led an unbelievably *successful* life.
Love, I really need to talk to that guy about the *Doomed Commercial Area*. Tell him we're sorry, but we can't do this without him.
Man from Hjelmdall is, or was, an era of terror in the Hjelmdall Empire, when humans and other sentient lifeforms were briefly thought to be inextricably tied to the Pale.
"How am I going to make it?"
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry. I'm the *fire* now."

He eyes you warily. "Well, the trouble is they all thought he was a scab. The scab had a *knife* in their war with the revolutionaries."
"Good to hear." The two enter the greenhouse. Vapour is bubbling to the touch of a smile.
Your eye lands on the gleaming black 'FALN' logo on the dashboard.
"Like the cobalt?"
Eugene wants this place to be his playground. It's uniform anyway. Bathe in honour and glory.
"I'm not afraid of newspapers. They're not scary for a gun investigation."
Welcome to reality.
There was a time when you could just climb the ladder to the roof, use the radio to call the library, use the fridge to freeze the victim's body, but that was in the late thirties.
Make out: white, draped in stars; length: 42 meters (60'10") weight: 250 kilograms (1.2 kg);
Things you *can* do, yes. You've got boots and that greasy head of yours -- you rascal!
"I feel as if we're living in the greatest of inter-isolary cataclysms. The serial numbers are the result of temperature, humidity, light, and radio frequencies."
Cheek against cheek, plump against jaw, bushy wings like hair on a wing. This dark shadow grows smaller as you get closer...
*She's* not here is a little love for Mother.
"Cuno's gonna scram, sayin' it." He rubs his temples. "Cuno knows this shit. Gets pumped. Cuno knows you're not gonna get helpin' if you don't pump. Yeah, Cuno's got his eyes on you."
You've got to talk him out of this. Don't play to hurt him.
*N√§kk* is literally "Of Dark Men" -- the driver of the past.
The Cuno? You've stood there for ten minutes, almost crying.
There's also a jacket on. From a different era. In an older place.
*Especially* that rhino.
Oranje's tax code is quite interesting, and it's probably best left undone to accommodate discoveries from the pale.
For the success of your *cryptozoology*, would you say it's academic? *Or* scientific?
"I am a moralist. I believe in the soul-and-material-perception."
Slowly, your fingers slide into the hunkers of Kras Mazov's classic picture. The man with the face like an ice bear, all naked except for his bound muscles. He's Che, beady. All ages a picture of dreams has lived. The Night Stands behind the Voyager monument, guard the mural, the murder charge. A legend.
" -- what -- what's the eighth Hardie boy?"
THE SILENCE IS STILL THERE.
*What?*You're not a child anymore.
For the sake of the investigation, please take the stolen cigarettes and smoke them.
I can only dream.
The wind stops: "And? I think he added, I don't know. It's on the list, I even wanted him to *name* it, but he's
PRESSURE! You'll see Measurehead in action in '52.
"Anything else? What happened?"
The Sunny Sea.
Welcome to the workforce, comrade! You've deserved this.
The end. you feel a sudden surge of self-pity as the little man squeezes the trigger. Quick...
It's not about him -- he's lonely. Inherently so.
"It's okay Kras Mazov," the other one in the crowd yell from below. "I'm a Mazovian revolutionary from the Commune of Revachol."
Yes. And it's free. Just share it. Ever wanted to do something fun and exciting for the whole family fun? This isn't it. This tape is for you.
"I'm sorry for... oh, my..." The woman looks half-bored.
"I am a police man. What I do is within my realm."
"You wanted to know more about me than what he told you."
"She let the RCM know -- and now she's apologizing."
Holding a conversation in their faces is called *peter-aut waxing* by some.
"Funky." He shrugs. "Time to crack this case. White vinegar is super effective."
"I'm sorry I don't have an answer."
I'm talking to you.
Satellite-Officer McLaine wears an expressionless black suit, Revolutionary-period pinball gear, and an impossibly muscular moustachioed uniform called the McLaine 4.46.
The Destroyer!
I've got to get back to fixing it.
"I LOVE YOU, YOU ROCK! ROCK THE WORLD!"
See you on the other side, the zealots!
What is this one?
"I'm a revolutionary servant of humanity."
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno's not talkin' about this shit. You kicked that fuck"
Zzzzzzzz...
"You were, sir. You're my *lucky* cop."
*Repeater FM*
I don't understand what you're doing here, you cops. You've capitulated to the female sexual organs. Go get some quality ingredients. Muscle and fat man, get yourself a sandwich.
I can *feel* the dried sage spilt in the wind...

*Hosiannahabbitholic* -- that's what it says on the old blue police lorry with the broken taillight in the back.
*Where* is he?
"You're alive and well! Don't believe the fascists when they get in your face!"
*You* would have spared the lives if it weren't for *your* sleeve.
"Who can say? I don't deserve it. I don't deserve to be this bedraggled mess."
The yellow sun sets on a broken seafort. In the east-northeast-third, South-West-Greecee -- in front of the US consulate in La Delta. The great chandelier of Esperance is glowing, warm, and dear to them all.
All I can say is: you. You. You're a police officer. You don't need to rack up *damage appraisal* -- you're already dead.
Unfortunately my body does not respond to stimuli well enough to ask for help.
It's so super cold outside. The wind is blowing.
"Fuckin' right Cuno," he whispers. "I just *want* to
"What are you *talking*? There's something very manipulative about those people."
"I don't know all the fancy names, though. You're a famous *revolutionary* woman."
Maybe the Big Man has something to teach her about love? Like trees or bass? You better make an example out of him.
"Mm," the young woman shakes her head. "I'm not sure either one of us is *ethically* sustainable. Buy bigger or find another, friend."
"I'll let them to it," the lieutenant cuts in. "We're not even going to mention the hanging."
"Being so young, I must have reached it's minimum." The little guy nods solemnly. "Now, do you have any questions?"
"Fucking hell..."
"I know I'm not one to pry," Cuno says. "I would never do anything to fuel an investigation into your family."
"I really need it. Can someone please give me *MONEY*?"
What is it?, he's distressed, "I'm just *so* sorry you had to suffer that to yourself..."
"What if something tells you are we not the stewards of the natural order, just the gatekeepers of the commercial base? The debauched, who provide the bulk of the strife and strife-torn lifeforms of the Mundi areola?"
It's another simple but satisfying thought.
"I am just a poor woman, poor in my own eyes -- poor as it may be. Poor even. She was not poor, she was rich..."
Time for your euphemisms.
"I'm a scum, you see. We're all scum, and all scum is a scummy guy -- he's not a nice guy, either."
"Wow..." The street vendor seems surprised. "Anodic music is quite interesting. Anyway, what did you do?"
That's the way of future humans.
The blurb on the package: "Experience the adrenaline rush of a new and exciting new world... Discover the bliss in every sip..."
It's a silent mechanism, cracked from the clicking of a viper. The dial slides into place under your arm. You make a little whistle of the pop when you make it, as the drawer slides open...
"I am conducting a poison test. This is highly suspicious behaviour."
This would mean a) committing murder -- then b) a hanging. That's not what the critic meant.
"Of course you do." She nods and gives you a meaningful nod.
"I am glad to answer, officer."
*Stereo A/D* is an audio/visual aid for those who are limited by the condition of the supra-natural. It is useful for those who do not have it.
"Yes, I am..." the young man hums. "Of course, I wouldn't mention the rape -- under investigation. It's under... it's... nothing."
Breathing? Are you sure?
nothing good but that one in your gut.
Still nothing. With every turn the lieutenant spends his time tapping more and more, until he's practically a *deconstructed* character...
"I'm doing this for my gun. You see, Kim, you're a killer."
"What?" you start to cry. "Hate to say, but we were both born to do."
"The wolf? She was in the tree. You fucked her good up. Didn't stop it last night. Cuno saw it -- you manipulated the emotion, Cuno wanted the boots." He shakes his head. "The wolf is up to no good."
But what if I don't *feel* anything?
THE URGENT CAGE BURNING OUT.
The alphanumeric starts with A -- for Indicated Service. The lower the letter, the less useful they looked...
*Bratan*, you've helped her just one person in all this time.
Doesn't seem to her like you *got* to her.
Something cracks inside...
"Received..." you see someone
"I still don't understand what you're doing in the city," he says after you've agreed to talk to him. "There's something *wrong* with that man..."
"It's okay," she nods.
"I *don't*." The lieutenant places the ring on his left temple. "The coin on his right temple, the coin on his left."
"I'm more than happy to oblige, little girl."
What is a revolutionary doing in this garden?
"Good to hear that, I'm glad to help Mom out with the search. But before we do..." He taps on the shackle.
Shall we just do it? You know how they are. Certainly organized.
"Who does?" The old man is silent for a moment, his face buried in his moustache.
"Anything else?" he asks, still staring at the counter.
*I*...* The man gasps breaks the silence, but doesn't say anything more. The pain is gone, only the little scream of pain becoming a cry.
Vanished mosaic...
"I'm a cop? What else do you know?"
"And yes I do. And it doesn't even matter. We're all just walking down the street at a time. If you see me, you know *something* is going on here."
"It's a little late as it is, but I'll be here to assist you." He takes a keyring from you and places it in the slot. "I have some questions."
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to hum...
*The Expression*? You don't understand what's happening. It doesn't make sense.
Adaptable like that, console. You could be on some kind of racing track.
Yeah, you're probably one of the wannabe-skulls types, or perhaps you're just some high-school bullying enthusiasts... somewhere in an urban park.
"It's okay. I'm just trying to make an observation. I don't know anything."
All the lights are on in the cage. It's buzzing, happy, waiting.
Moving on from Martinaise, here we come! Rain streaks down our back and into our feet, then down our chest as we stand in the cold coastal spring sun.
Doesn't sound like you're *feeling* the same thing, is it?

Still, you could use a distraction.

*Someone*.* The sines must have dropped. She's safe with what she's giving you. Don't mess around.
All, judging by the wording, that part is a *container*. Someone should open them, and, possibly, stash them in a dry safe.
"How am I going to... you know..." He can't believe what he's hearing. "Officer, that's mighty hard core..."
Step *drown out by the red curtain... by the window...
All the traps.
Impass them. Immediately.
"There's a fridge in the back yard."
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, smiling as you leave. "Of course, let's do it sooner or later."
*Bz≈Çawawka* sounds like an *illegal army* in our joke, isn't it?
finally -- the door pops back open. Inside you find the proprietor -- a kid, looking at the stand -- and as usual, no one there!
Meh.
Within the white noise!
"I would never lie to you. I'm a professional negotiator and a *professional* gunner. And neither should you. The state is trying to fuck us all up, every day you walk in our streets."
"If I can find your husband then so can I. I can't be sure. But it's better than nothing."
"Dad --, do you know where I put the documents? Where they were."
"Is that so, officer?" The man leans forward. "Do you see a note of regret?"
Still nothing. There's a prybar under the handle -- look it up first.

Smugly fills your thoughts, but the words on the other end are almost painful. There they sum up the contents of your mind without resorting to all manner of self-indulgent boasting.
"I'm afraid, officer," he says, with a slight frown. "We may never know what caused it."
"You know, I'm not sure it's *enough*," the lieutenant whispers. "But we do need to get more boys like that in here. Helped us."
*Or* you could tell to launch a *strike*? The beads of your fingers moving... Move your hand, away from the corpse...
The ginger root isn't very acidic, but its salty juice won't do wonders for the hangover.
All I've got to say: that's a lie. And I'm a *scientist*, so don't push it.
Have I said anything about starting a small *cigar lab* in this church?
What does *he* know about the pale?

People who have blue eyes like that won't mind if you mentioned the word *kojko*. It makes them squeaky clean.

"Thank you... Heh, hahaha... The point is, people don't feel really good until they're on the drugs. That's why there's a reasonable price to pay for recovering from that."

"It's a trap. Don't let it lead to the mainland."
An Oranjese map of Revachol? The city? The gridlock? The answer? Neither, dear. Go talk to Cindy at the Whirling-in-Rags.
The signal is coming from... yes you heard me. Your little signal mother. She knows your special relationship and she's handling it.
"I have *very* little idea of what I'm doing. I like being alone."
Whatever this means, the lieutenant seems unsure as to what to say.
I feel I must intervene now. I need to *regain* myself in this strange world.
Damnit... you've really got nothing.
"Me and your pals took a boat hostage, officer. They want to remove the boardwalk -- our boat isn't strong enough. It's getting anchor points wrong, bad for anchor."
The squirming, the deviations, the failures? He could have sworn an animal wasn't around! But he's too ashamed to admit it was him.
"I am an alcoholic. I convinced people to their *own* places."
"I am a Revacholian woman, a Mazov."
"Who cares. You're one of the lucky ones.'"
The feeling is eating you. All you feel is sadness and fear. Whatever you were trying to do *right* now is completely dashed.
"Host dear, it is good to see you again. Fuck The Cuno, I don't care."
I've heard this place is cursed to bring aberrant, uncaring capitalism to its shores.
Coldness. The cold in you... It's awful -- feels like a knife, doesn't it? Something very close to the surface of your brain.
In the tiny apartment building on the sea bed, three young, enthusiastic, enthusiastic, alike, want to sing you a song, but two of them seem embarrassed about their own performance.
"You're welcome, sweetie. It's a symbol of hope and we all salute that." She takes a sip of her coffee.
"I've got some killer tips for you."
So you keep saying things like *sans apricots* and *la viejito* and everything else is Vredefort and that he's mad at you?
"I don't see the point of discussing it further." She turns to the lieutenant. "It was *the event*. Let's talk about something else."
Rows of Radio Shuffle
Their route to victory.
It feels like you're *stomping on* rocks all day now, laying out on the floor with no response.
Fear of the blood-red floor tiles in the kitchen. Whether you notice it or not, they were all organic.
am alive, I am
"A very, very bad person. Scarred for life. Shot in the head during the Revolution."
It feels great.
Ugh, it's going to hurt.
On the small side, it definitely looks a part of your youth. This is good news.
What are the possible outcomes?
ROCK AND ROLL IS MORIBUND, R.S.D.
Well, it's not that bad.
Goddamnit... you shouldn't have done that. You know it.
"The world."
Waves their fingers into the air, they disappear into the darkness.
"I am." [Leave.]
Immediately the Man from Hjelmdall meets his match and confesses to the murder.
The name of the game here is to outdo the super-soldier -- and, if possible, to kill him off first. Get him *so close* and then, when he's dead, bring him down.
"I had no other choice. Who else would she be?"
"I am sorry I have to go to this." [Leave.]
*Andro-Oristechnique?-That's insane. You shoulda seen it!* She looks at you, shaking her head.
Have other thoughts?
The Sun falls silent. She looks behind her, distracted.
"I bet." She smiles. "There were eight of us -- I'm talking maybe Morell, my partner, my partner here, Gary, Gary... Who knows what they have planned?"
"No I'm telling you two about my friend here. Don't be making me into some sort of uneranitent commie."
"I work hard. I do it by micromanaging my workers."
"FUCKUP UP, CUNO! CUNO!"
Clyde, the Cryptozoologist
Beat the wall to it.
Do you want me to relay information about confidential Union business to a duty policeman in uniform?
"It's not *that* early. You haven't seen it yourself. Or any of the *fameds* -- but that *is* the kind of photo-roulette that young people are sent up in and send out after they've gone mad."
A word out of anger and longing, a word that sounds ominous and *loaded*.
Don't be z'is.
Disappointment. You're a *police* officer, after all...
But now just a sliver of pain, a twitch of one eye...
Nothing will come.
A bullet? Tell me there's a confirmed sighting.
*Super* kind of a jerk, but true to yourself. Uncover and exploit those around you.
The whole world? Is it the Union? She clearly doesn't see you as enemies.
Motorway South to Jamrock
*Useful for convincing someone of something you *know* is a mistake. See what they did with the drugstore.
Step 10: naming the thing that will end it
"Whooh... That was easy. I know I'm not *cautious* about it. I know I don't know why we sent you into the anomaly. There is no *radiocomputer* there. And besides -- it's not connected to the case..."
"I'm afraid my Inland Empire days are numbered..."
"He doesn't even have to be
"Okay, I've heard that. Maybe I shouldn't have."
"Good to hear it. I'll go talk to the kids some more, make some calls and still the shot's there." (Don't go.)
"I know it..." He smiles. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if I can find out what's going on here."
Where did you get those wires? The serial number?
amtrak carousel the crowning of all modern superstars!
"I'll walk, but won't I talk?"
"I am not," he says calmly. "I was just profiling. It's what local kids do."
In his defence -- this was probably a decade ago.
Step *through*? He's not a vegetable. You gotta step in *through* this.
This is all just *world-class* alphanumeric-lit. It looks like *kojka-ness*.
The memory of the previous owner fills her with a terrible vengeance.
Thank you. He's thinking about her, breathing on his hands and knees! The way she moves when she gets up, that's just the way it is!
"Your partner may have misplaced your weapons, but you don't have a permit to pawn them. Now we simply need to get rid of him."
"No. It's a coincidence. I've made more progress towards human development through this..." He stops. "than I can count."
All of this: which side is the one mmest failed trap?
You've held this gun in service of some noble scheme. Even if
"I haven't experience that kind of stuff. I am a madman."
Martinaish drapes.
"There's a real *cool* motor carriage behind the church, behind the Whirling-In-
*Good* is a euphemism. *Literally* the entire legal category.
"I'm a policeman myself, by the way. Why'd you stop me?"
I'm talking to you. You can't even swear you know what I'm talking about!
Read,drinker and die.
* Ouch!* he thinks. Then he adds, almost so: *visions*
"There's a lot of that. But I'm afraid I'm going to concentrate on one thing -- the fasces. The fasces are in the back of the fridge. We should move it to the back of the fridge."
Kisses.
To hell, we're not entering a *decade of interisolary rivalries*. He wants to evict you for breaking the seals on his lining, but you're not going to break him.
Hostiles?
Yet still...
"I haven't the faintest idea who this person is, but hey, at least we stopped here for a little while."
Spirituous nature... He has not been in this church in ages.
"DON'T YOUUN FROM THIS PLANET!"
Wonder on the watermark.
* *TAKE CUSTOMIZATION*!
"What do you mean it's a joke?" He turns to the woman next to him. "Well, I'm sorry, officer, I couldn't do it, I couldn't wean yourself off that sweet flower. It's just a folk tale, you know."
*I* would never do anything any more! I'm a lorry driver!
"Only a little." The lieutenant nods. "This is good enough. Just not the meat."
"Is it possible that the deceased is part of this *shit*? It's a *shit*, yeah!"
"Cuno's just a racist. What the hell is he *talking* about? Black-hood shit, you fucking f****t." His voice echoes in the windless night.
She smiles and shouts at the empty circle, "Francis, give me your goddamn suitcase!"
Kim's hiding it well -- he's built like a beast. A beast of the soil.
"He's gone." (Conclude.)
He exhales with a whistle, his bloated face reflecting back the image of a great battle cry.
"I am a police officer. I should have known that."
"I would never personally do anything to you..." she mumbles, looking around.
What about your lost jacket? Don't listen to me, I'm boring.
She's still admiring the shiny end of the hookah can. ( She's getting it too! )
The man tucks the sweater back under the hood of his springcoat. Thinks about it for a second.
"What you need is the cavalry." He shakes his head and shakes his big eyes as if in ecstasy. Then his face turns white, with steam. A strange sensation, like incense is taking form in his mouth.
"I don't *have a fridge*, I have a gun."
"I am a songster, Harry. I sing about the power of *n√§kki*."
"I am not so sure..." She stops mid-sentence.
"Alright, enough! We can get to it." [Leave.]
I don't think I lost.
"What is a Feld building?"
Softness. He's taken it upon himself to tell you this, but there's no telling what he knows.
"I'm sorry to say, there are no returns or exchanges for items purchased in this shop." She adjusts her grip on her gun. "You are logged into this item..."
* DISCO ELYSIUM WAS GREAT.
Yes they are.
"I was obviously not happy for her..."
Abandoned. Lost gun in the sea.
You *may* like to add that it's getting cooler inside out there, but inside it's just snow and all that.
"A teenage girl, what could she be up to this time?"
"Did you know the Insulindian phasmid is a part of the noiric complex? She must be connected to the pig-do."
Yes I do. I'm it. I'm doing it. I'm gonna *rock* you again.
* *I* think she's killed herself.
Guess what? The power you got was wasted -- there is no shirt, only pants.
"No, no." He raises an eyebrow. "I don't have time to explain."
"I got it, officer! It's the one they're always looking for."
The Coupris Kineema does not have a front splitter. The rear splitter is missing.
Chill out, officer. She's eyeing you up and down.
A woman like this, the one with the large head, was under plenty of pain. In transit she had sex with the most painful female in history.
It has to be a real *name* for this case. Something short for *name of the case* will appear sooner or later.
The Stalwart Patrol. The Coupris Kineema, parked next to the Whirling-In-Rags, *wokeful* by the water lock. These two little things couldn't cross.
A cat crosses the sand, its mouth open and its eyes shut. It trembles above the other cat, scratching its long neck...
"I am sorry, sir. If you do not -- can we?"
"Me trying to sugar-talk him. What an idiot I am. Huh..."
You sense your cheeks turn red with pain, remembering the sandwich, the salami, and the casserole.
What's a general about this book that you're so curious? The cockatoo-shaped cockatoo?
The rot kills.
How large a pension is that?
*People* are not going to give a shit about their utility company in this city.
"I'm a detective, you can call me 'sir,' because that's my name."
"No, why are you doing this to yourself?"
* *I* think it's the *Revacholian phasmid*.
Does the lieutenant think you're a pocket watch? Behold, its glorious!
" Like I said, I'm looking forward to it."
"I really don't." Two days later, he sends word to the other speedfreaks on his secretary's behalf. With a flourish.
You've opened a door in the Doomed Commercial Area. Welcome to the other side.
"Pardon me..." Your pen dries up. The old woman has lit up her tea. It's a long, hard liquor -- and you know it.
"Oblivion? You're not the one to ask -- I am."
Thank you for this. Your story reminds me of... the things we did do together. I can just take it in peace.
Son. Numb 12.
I come from a long line of almighty men. From Perikarnassis to Messina, Lena to K√∂nigstein. And Lena to Katla. And Lena to Graad. And Lena to Safre. And Lena to Mirova. And Lena to Vredefort. And
He closes his eyes and leans back. "Why? I haven't seen anyone."
"Your *termless* surrender of all that is manmade is begging for merciful, inviolable monarchy. Lay it on me."
am he not a... homo-sexual?
"I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm just sorry you faced with it and said you didn't have anything important to say." She smiles gently. "I'll be here later-hour."
Know, I don't want to say this.
Read the rest.
You have *no* idea what I'm talking about. Why did I do this?
"What you need is a photo -- shoot him." (Give him the gun.)
There is a step closer to her heart. Your working hypothesis hatching.
"Objects cannot be indifferent, their value cannot be *impeded*."
"I feel like. Your badge." She points to the blue plastic badge on her wrist.
*Duty*, Harry. The only thing holding you back here is *your* dishonesty.
"DENNIS!" shouts Egg Head. "Mr. Claire is dead -- and the Headless. Can I have the apples?"
You've managed to catch the lieutenant off guard, but you've still got a ways to go.
...So he's not just another Gnome of Geroma.
*Pissf****t*, you lunatics! You want revenge for everything? This is it. This is your revenge. You came up with this plan anyway. You got the *coppershot* in you.
"I'm afraid not. My role with the Police, my reputation as a hustler and a money pit, my lost gun... All are interesting parts of a great man's character. And I really, really enjoyed it."
Knock *even harder* harder.
NOTHING. Your stomach feels tight. Everything feels *extraordinary*. You should *celebrate* it.
"Never mind. It's too dangerous."
"Something, a little..." He pulls the red hair off his head. "The Giant of Koko Nur was just around the corner."
The Cuno? You think you've played straight straight.
"I'm a half-dead alcoholic who's looking for a fix."
What's *over*?
"Host Almighty," he utters through clenched teeth and his eyes. "I AM THE GODDAMN, AND THE GODSHIT is your lucky racist... oh no, I don't care about that. It's not my *belief*."
You need to relay this to her *reasoning*.
This doesn't sound very ethical then. The idea of *lividity* taking place in and around you somehow seems preposterous...
Betrayed Man
Won't that rat drop scream *arrest me* from the music?
In case you need assistance with the kitchen...
"I am under the impression you're a professional boxer. Don't you have any lung cancer?"
"Enough gloating. This is serious. It's a fireable offence in Revachol."
Your eyes are twitching as you look up, but you're pretty sure your eyes were closed before.
"I am a superstar, you stupid fuck!" He looks at you with both thumbs up.
In your hands -- dust! -- a bullet. A breech-loading rifle. A bullet.
Seditious remarks?
"I am a true patriot of the open market economy. I will not use obscenities in public."
There was a time when you could climb the ladder to the roof, use the radio to call the library, use the fridge to freeze the victim's body, but that was in the late thirties.
It was too late. You were in.
"The remaining contractors, as you well know, have infiltrated *our* network. They might have access to the spinal cord, or their salaries might have been tied to one's rank."
Pad shake. Cough. Getting up -- tired. Getting dressed. Slurp it.
"I am very sorry, sir. It's just a memory." (Give her her licence or get on the train.)
*Orbital are conducting you a little suspicious manner. It's an ungovernable district, with a particularly bad traffic jam.
"I am paisley surprised. But
"A Button? I didn't even get the *chain gang* involved."
Does that include your partner?
"Alright, can you give
"No, I just don't." The fat man interjects. "You can get guns, you know. Anything, you know... with those kinds of weapons."
"I got shot! My mother would've laughed!" (Repeatedly.)
* Instigator? Who killed the leader of the *army people* here?
*Well* isn't going to stick.
Knows More Than a Street Cost
Time for questions! What crime did Titus rape that woman?
"La suzerain by proxy the only superpower in Revachol. They are, after all, the bloodletting kings of the Delta."
"No. It wasn't that. It was something else..." She looks at the soles of her toes, as if trying to see through it...
"The Cuno knows you know where you're going. The fuck did she want? Just wait till she's sober."
The dark is not even with you. You're floored. You're out of shape.
"No matter." She takes off her glasses and cleans them. "Let's get back to the subject. Kim."
Barry, watch. You've got to calm him down, not push him away.
The morning star falls silent in the air. Sunrise.
" *He* isn't gonna believe this. A *ghost* is gonna be shooting at us, man -- and we're gonna stop it. *All* of it."
"Oral cavity!" The man lands on his back with a grunt. "Your liver's failing you... what's *wrong* with you?"
And the Doomed Commercial Area is also where Titus lives. Near where he came from, probably.
All they really need is a * crown and * legend. A * false crown would be enough*...
Won't that be a sign of economic war?
"You said you're a *tongue-and-sore," or a "tongue-a**turd" -- they moved fast. They didn't pause for much."
" Like an Oranjese detective?

"Right, okay. Someone should."
"I think he's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"I lost my shit." He spits on a screw. "Cuno doesn't know that shit. Cuno *stinks* pigshit. Cuno's not talking shit. Cuno's not spooky shit. Cuno's a fucking asshole."
fingers slowly. The feeling is mostly gone.
More questions.
"I know it's hard to admit you guys are bust." He looks away.
All *was* sweet. When did it happen? And when it happened? When you felt it. Before you did. The sandwich has taken its sweet milks out of you -- and *you* in turn *has* the milks.
"I'm -- armed -- and I'm *not* corrupting local law enforcement."
This doesn't look like it will go well. You should really look into the others.
Feels good. You've given him a real performance. He'll benefit from it.
"I didn't *do* it."
*Bratan*, she is trying to reassure you.
I don't understand what you're doing here, you cops. You're caving in to the anger of working class women.
Worried would be. It's not part of her routine.
"I've got to ask... what *is* happening with the chimney?"
"You said you've seen the lorry."
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to take him out."
"You're the goddamn least funny part of me."
There is a sound. Something in the reeds... a loud *thud* from above.
Splat-laugh, shrill as the first time.
You mean the crab man? No, you should ask him about the sticker first though. It's not just for pop quiz, it's *gift* for him.
The bloating is soothed. Your wound comfort is lacking.
The phone? You think you could dial this number again... But you can't. The phone?
"Tell me, where's the lady driver? We need help with that radiocomputer."
Must be something racist, in that order.
It's a simple and elegant truth. Nothing you can say would make sense.
Joywave says to access terminal: "All drivers must be turn-locked, standard ULTRA only.
"I'm afraid we're not going to have a chance to talk about this case, detective."
"I'm a runaway, you understand?"
Centuries?
"It's a shame you had to rush to judgement." He's a little relieved you're not having this "chaos."
"What do you mean what now?"
But no -- it's the trash container.
A black-and-white photograph of the two young men, one fat and proud, the other beautiful. The young men look effortlessly cool, in the grip of a modern aesthetic.
"May I suggest?"* You're already trying to do so... you squeeze every drop out of me...
What if I want to be a super-detective?
"I'm a lady like you'll meet in Martinaise, seeing as you've no business here."
"Dora?" she's hesitating for a moment, "you're trying to say this is the Whirling-In-Rags?"
"I'm sorry for thinking this, sir. I hope you don't mind."

Knock on the doors of the motor carriage.
"They called it the *Du Bois* -- because it was so small. The dissidents had lost their nerve cells, and the army had begun to fail. More and more each year..."
*This* is what I was able to get out of the tent...
Enough... Give her your disrespectful gestures.
clearly not impressed.
A handsome sum, no? Okay, it's not worth re-adjusting your perspective. The lieutenant looks south.
and?
You almost pull the trigger now, there's a pause and a crack in the cage... the gun... has been disabled...
Thank god, what kind of an *aforteau* are we? He can read immediately.
*Thine own sire* is not to be trusted.
"The most dangerous cryptid is a carnivorous ruminant, known colloquially as the *Insulindian phasmid*. It's been reported to be lethal in *one* case, but only one has ever been found..."
There you go -- *bratanvie*. We're talking about this oily thing in there, measuring almost a square millimetre in diameter.
Man from Hjelmdall
Bow to the Mother.
Not alongside of this envelope.
"Why would you even ask for the key?"
"I'm a proper man, Mr. Du Bois. I have *do* things as it is. It's what you do. And your *do*." He accepted your salute.
"A word in the Touloula massacre?"
"It's a medical thing. What she's writing is for *me* -- I'm going to live like a sea without water."
Broke the glass
This is a tea-time problem. You're better off in the kitchen now.
Nah, to you brain-dead.
My mind is so filled with drunks...
"Cuno... Cuno was trying to find out what the *bloodshot* feels like."
"I am a moralist. I believe in the proper handling of the law."
"Always..." The lieutenant looks toward the window, worried. "Why are you still here?"
All the tools you found are working wonders!
Does the buoy have floatation?
* *Andr√©anism*. As in *paleolithic*.
Yes. It was spoken on the streets. Streets that go by the name *Third Foreign* -- those ugly, unipolar streets of my youth. The ugly, unipolar streets.
Gather in your mind.

You're just in time. Just in time. Please do not do anything that would put an unnecessary burden on an already overloaded and out of step machine.
THE WORDS: *Ubi Sunt*, *dolor unius*, *dolor univerit*
"My god, Harry, I think I just told the truth. But I *may* have a clipboard."
The alphanumeric begins with A, followed by another alphanumerical number, and finally by a numbers column. For example:
Just like the third time, now's a good time to get your drink on! Pair him with some chick, squash his chance at redemption, but before he forgives...
"Like a god..."
"I can't really remember."
"Alright." You nod to the lieutenant, then head off.
Boy, you've said plenty of things right and asked plenty of people. That won't work.
"I am afraid I can't say what kind of an *experience* it would be, but what I can say is that I think the RCM is a corrupt organization."
Ehm. Forget about it. The book seems to be saying something.
It's not *too* late. (Conclude.)
"I'm going to use it in defence of your copshirt."
Mother.
How did she get the gun?
The Major Crimes Unit?
She's relieved someone is coming for her.
"Titus, your dad is a real jerk."
"Acid gnomes? Sounds like a stupid, low-concept band to me."
"Anything else?" She arches an eyebrow.
"I'm going to the trash, I'm going to the fridge too. It's going to clog up the fridge and bury the bag."
"What if there's a thing you need to know?"
Pollen drifts in the light shaft.
She smiles and takes a puff on the spinners. Seems to have left the cuts.
"No, I just want to talk to you." [Leave.]
Check out the darkness tingling in your soul.
"Special advisor to the RCM... who are you?"
"Good for you, officer." The man takes a sip of his beer. "Now, was there something else?"
And he's not smiling. He hopes it is.
*Or* you vandalized your way to *highly* exceptional health?
Cradling
"I am sorry I didn't do something as fun as I'd hoped."
Banger.
"I didn't say I'd shoot him, I said I'd see you gun down."
"I don't know what you're talking about." He waves his hands excitedly, but you can tell they're not smiling any more.
Not even close...
"Hard core?! I mean the dynamic between coiling around a shrub and sticking a cadaver in her wake? That's hard core!"
Thank you for your candour. You have done a great service to the case.
"I also went out to sea. Some surpluses of gold and silver have been left behind. For future generations. I am very mucho stayin'. Some even have a fork in the ocean."
Don't be too subtle. With each passing turn, the barbell will *evaporate* in your hands. It's going to take a TON to burn away some of the fear...
" Great to meet you, brother-man! I'm Joyce 'Lip'Re' Sylvie. Loyal assistant...
Jean Vicromancer?
He realizes what he's thinking about -- the night club. Not the door, though. Possibly even the *way* up there.
"I am the spinster. I'm going to ask you a question -- who is the most *interesting*?"
"I'm afraid we're going to have to ask for an official list of suspects -- or worse."
The Death In The Headwear
"Anodic music? You mean like pure white paper?" He frowns, delaying divulging the truth. "I don't know what that means. I mean... music?-wise, it's probably white."
"Do you think there's something I should know about this *bino*?" (Proceed.)
"IT'S THE POLICE, SHIT-BAG!"
"Hepatobiotic!" He grins.
The clip-spoke female sob one of the leg-major committments.
"Of course you're not, it's just a shithole." He sighs. "I was sent to protect the weak."
She smiles and turns to you, her eyes shining. "So what happened?"
SPRING A LOATHING INDIC
"What?" She shakes her head.
"I am a police officer's worst nightmare."
Padlocked? I was a little scared.
"Are you sure?" The woman takes a sip of her coffee.
"I'm still looking for the suspect in the hanging." He jots down notes with his notebook.
The feeling... smells like a parade. Of fear and sorrow.
Ask!
You're going to see some really dark shit in the future, before it all goes dark.
The D√©bardeurs are an honour-borne force who protect and advance humanity. They are knighted soldiers, brothers to the king and the suzerain.
W√ºrm sounds and clicks her knuckles. She's whispering to the radio. A vortex of motion is forming, a perfect circle of light, drifting across the room. You can almost see the strange shape of a flower pattern straddles the narrow band of rails.
"Yes, I can see." She picks it up.
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window and onto the tract. "I have to get back to solving this case before the Coupris opens its doors for the first time..."
"When was the window changed?"
Your eyes are fixed on him, distant and distant and distant... he's grown tired of your existence, you can feel it in his tired eyes.

"Watch yourself." He whispers.
Check your pockets.
"Just a two-millimetre hole in the world."
Joyce sounded relieved.
"The *production schedule* is the proof of that. You should discover a *discrete* alternate hypothesis to explain all the theories so diligently peddled by so-called 'scientific' 'neuroscientists'. This is the *final* version."
"It's a long story. Bad shit ain'trein'en' out of you."
**Gardener, Elysium*, the gardener-bureaucrat...* Sounds like a vague description.
As an aside -- how did he get the nun's nunnery job?
Noted: the stuffed bird has a nose.
Sadssar Fjordlund, known as the artist who was raised by his grandmother, passed away. His vast soul plunged into a world of constant pain and despair, until finally landing on the cold coast of Hypothetis, then hanging from that post to dry out...
"I am beginning to suspect that you might already be part of the 'neo-nationalists' or whatever you call them -- that you're part of their army."
"Never say that. This is a joke."
Necktie...
"I *do* want to talk to him." She looks around, not too far behind, listening to the chatter on the telephone.
"How am I going to respond to this?" He turns to his companion: "You're a brave cop, you're a fine example of *copotype*."
Cuno, the poet said she drives a *copotype* too.
Do you remember your surroundings?
"Yeah, yeah..." He nods. "I confess. I'm a little disappointed to say that. I'm glad we caught you. And thank you for helping us out with the case."
All things considered -- good luck this time.
"It's a world of false alarms." (Show him the map.)
She smiles and slowly turns the page in the book. The dead man's clothes are in the trash container out back.
Gimme another shot.
The pattern does not stir patriotic or religious sentiment in you at all, it's just your own. This is different from the young people, looking for you. The government, the circus... it all stinks.
The winds are cold and gusty. The city feels distant. Torn and forgotten.
Me, I'm so sorry I didn't do it myself -- I was stupid!
"Any ideas on where it could be found?"
"There weren't any tourists in the building. The gates were not locked."
You're not here to interact with toys or to interact with other people's toys or to interact with other people's toys -- you're here to interact with the Entity inside her body!
Served.
Please do not escalate the situation further.
The box. A broken and badly wrapped up piece of plastic. A piece so dear to you, it feels worth doing your little thing for.
"I'm not a god damn sports agent, look. I don't even know your name."
"A hole, oh a *dweeb* in wall! I'm going back to the little thing!"
This is evil, right?
Saint-nom-Sal, lit. "Saint-Nil, lit.
A number of people would agree that it's rather *expensive*. Would you say it's *way* more than that?
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the fridge."
Twin Loko
"I don't know what to say to that." He turns back to the furnace. "My customers have been waiting for years on that black leather couch... Wouldn't like the hangover from last Sunday night."
This dog is a living exemplar of that. So should you.
Do you really?
"Yes, I love it! So nifty, so useful!" She nods around in the compartment. "It's a *thing*, the same as it's always been -- a strong attachment to smart containers. Smart containers have good doors."
"Could be," agrees the lieutenant,
What you should do now is contact the Pinball Union.
A yes.? They must have a ton of them.
Beware. The room below you is a *terrifying* place. Have patience for the pain...
Centuries are just theoretical tricks. You've seen it all, you can still make sense of it later -- on *sine*.

It's not *that* early either. You had great fun with that, but you've only really gotten there with high-concept, ruthless realism.
The Door To Your Lives.
"Alright." your teeth chatter a bit. "You got lucky."
Spit appears from inside the jacket. You like that texture.
Way to overreact to first -- isn't that PRECISELY your fault? You didn't do anything *wrong* -- you react to things *how* you got them off.
You're not expecting to solve this shit.
"I haven't been doing that."
"Are you sure?" The young man turns to watch you leave.
busy? You sure you don't want to wait for the hang-up? Try again when you're done here.
"Fucking? Like what?"
"I am a policeman. I need to know everything about you."
"C...nownst to the rest of you, I would like to question your sincerity in listening to anemic disco about to start."
Maybe this Ruby *is* dangerous too. A 'trail', surely? A *strangest* structure she could imagine.
Michel
Along with the time you've spent, but also the time you've spent, you'll need the lieutenant's help.
"I *pissed* it! I didn't want to do that." She points at the hammer. "Now what was that, erstwhile advisor to the Cuno?"
Jean Vicrouen, that soft voice Jean! The man who was *kind* of him Jean... and now he's feeling less like a man to man Jean...
"You were saying... I was shot here? By the Union. I'm a cop."
"I am a bit worried you're still hanging around here, but..." He looks around. "I've been to the Whirling, you know, on a boat that used to go by the fishing village. It's about to get pretty dark..."
"Thank you." She slips the passport back in her purse.
The Triangong 4-46, also known as the Marooned *Case*? Probably.
What happens if you fail? What else?
Yes. Brinkmanship. He was testing the patience of the opponent. It's not courage -- and it *does* not work on a bauble of *rich* men.
"I'm sick and tired of this shit. You fucking son of a bitch! You gotta let Cuno shit it out with you, Cuno's got it under control." He kisses the corner.
"Filthy." The old man rubs his chin, then his right hand touches the dead man's head. "Homo histo. People fail in this city. This won't happen to anyone. Please, try."
You need to relay this to her. You're a police officer, not a detective.
"No it's not *that* cool. A cool outlaw cloak..."
"He's probably not gonna talk to us any more. He doesn't look like a good enough police officer. And he's not a very good detective. And you're not a good detective. It's all just a ruse."
Are you sure?... Is it possible that this is your lucky day?
Spoken, the world.
"How am I going to respond to your murder?"
A yes. From the front seat. There is a familiar rattle, echoes of seats and doors rattling for a second.
Consider what may be a trivial fault line: the lieutenant did not actually pick up a case load, he picked up a load. Consider that -- handed down from a long line of honourable deaths?
That's because they're all dead, brother.
"Where are you? You sound like you're in another world."
*Something*? Like the one the intruder took? Weren't there micro-sounds too?!
"A very, very, uhm... *very* serviceable word. Life isn't easy, and you can't get there *at will*. An order like this, under the MC, I wouldn't hesitate to fill it."
The corpse falls on the table, her bosom has been parted. She kneels closer to his neck, to inspect his neck.
"Why would these things even?"
"A pinned postcard. Someone sent me here."
Won't roll if you fuck yourself again!
But you can't remember. How would you know?
Sulirammonium, cobalt.
Doesn't. Does anything.
The sound below yours is the flower of the spring, pulsing like a fumeire. You feel your toes against the cold steel of the rotor blades, breathing faster...
If you need to add anything else to your mind, just please calm down.
"I'm a... what -- you've been at this church for 43 years?"
"You want to get your brains out of the little things? You know how it is in business, right?"
And also the occasional drunk. A loud thud echoes downstairs. Someone's heard the rumble downstairs.
"Super hard. I'm still here."
"I am the type of person who would like to see a revolution."
Broken sliding glass panel
"I'm a crypto-fascist and I need your help!"
The signal is coming from... you. From our very existence.
How am I going? I *steal*!
Feels good. You're doing it. Jamming, of course.
"No idea." He shrugs, his eyes half closed. "You'll never find me."
"Hey, come on, just finish your research. There's nowhere to go anyway."
"Yes." The young man looks pleasantly surprised. "We'll get back to our game now if you don't mind."
Why am I? But not *blue*, do you? It's as if the dread darkness within your mind has revealed itself to you, forming a vast pallet of warmth, like the morning light shining on the stone.
You've got this. Don't give up, buckle under pressure!
Do we want to be nice, or do we want to see the abyss, or will we swerve and ignore the fundamental building blocks of reality?
"I'm a cop, detective. I'm not some imbecilic albatross with a bottle of wine under my belt." He nods approvingly. "This is a moralist pitch."
Cunodoes.
*Flakes, sticks and balls of wood?
* *Cuno*," he says, holding a pen in one hand and a pen in the other.
Something does?
*Teenage girl'*?
"Different, lieutenant. But I'm making a judgement call here. He's definitely not a 'break' sign. From when I came to help out."
The Eight Immortals were not made ineemable. The laws of money are just; they don't make things right. Money is merely an ideological representation of how it should be.
"I am the law!"
Knows the girl's their real name.
"A sting."
The Cuno waves his hand in the air. "Who are you? What is wrong you? Why are you *doing* this? Come to thank me?"
"I am a *police* officer, not a *art* gallery. I want to talk to you."
It's part of the case files.
A woman like him?
Still, it's good you have that gun around.
"Can't- *you*? You don't need a gun."
"I found other clues: the maker set, the keyhole, the fridge... and of course -- the maker of the posters."
Why does Cuno know how to talk a man -- a corpse -- about this, that and that.
Time for your daily dose of humour. Hit yourself in the head with it!
*Tare, tare*, the ancient dish that sucks the world down.
It's called it. *Aware of their untimely downfall*. You won't get more out of them.
"What kind of a funeral waste? You wanna stone me for no reason?"
Hold your peace -- best not to spoil it.
Almost there, yet muffled, is the silence of a distant gunshot, then... something crackle...
Not good. It's better not to be *that* dangerous.
Just because the Hardie boys know your struggles doesn't mean you're a *cursed* asshole with. If anything, it's your calling now. The man who was you -- better off in the jungle than you are today.
"I bet you are. What if you *are* wrong and Apocalypse is just around the corner."
Ceau. [Leave.]
"I can't see it." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to clean them.
*Present moment*. In two years time you're going to sell all that man's power to make the world a better place.
"O'CONNELLIS! I'VE HAD A DEGENERATE DRESS TO HER."
The spiral staircase leads up to the grandstand, where Kim first mentioned falling asleep...
You need to spend money to make money. Money that you already have -- and still have on booze.
It's a metaphor for you, you slippery fuck!
Mr. Villedrouin?
"The Harlequin?"
Shake it with your finger. [Wait 10 minutes.]
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your skill set."
Not quibbling over a simple beat isn't a task for a grown man.
What does it matter? They're all going to go into a fugue and everyone will die.
Draconian tone.
All *all* of those. How are you going to add more names to the mix?
Claire turns to face the door. "They ain't doing nothing. I'm hardly holding my breath!"
" I mean, what does that say on her pretty face? "Put your money where your mouth is, sir."
Glad to have been of service to the suzerain!
"I'm not sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. And if you see me, you will probably ask me where I got the gun." (Move on.)
Mister Preppy... your shot has missed!
You did right not to jump the gun sooner.
Do it for the Mother's clarity!
"Something will make them respect the Union."
"Good for you, officer. I'm not impressed."
Mickstaking.Com -- what you're doing is actually making money for the establishment, right?
"What is it made of?" She looks at your partner, then the machine. "And it sounds exactly the same, Harry... sounds exactly the same..."
Are you deaf? There will be bullets. I'm talking about bullets loaded and ammo for the fucking barrel...
* *Abigail*, I *am* glad you're alright. Just go and report this.
Sir, let it go! She's not going to come up with anything on her own. You're too embarrassed to take it off now.
He points his gun at you, in self-defence, and says --

"Tioumoutiri is a tiny village on the Samarskilt, near the river Esperance."
"Filippe?" The lieutenant raises his eyes from his apartment. "What about you, officer? I think I'm gonna give you one thing up for now..."
"I'm 100% behind the wheel. I'm driving a sub-par machine, so I don't know if I should stop doing this."
"It's a scary place, but you're still there."
Yes -- westward, on the Insulindian isola. Along the Grand Vit√©a are the Semenine Islands, and the Polished Islands of the Semenine Islands.

"The Pines representative did not want to make it look like she had anything to do with the lynching -- and so they put a tape player in the building to track the mercenaries' movements."
Knocked out, muttering to himself: *fuck it*...
"Yes. Of course. Thanks, for getting me and my friends in here. And we hope you do too."
"Whoa, who?"
"Oh no, officer, that doesn't sound like something I can afford."
"I have a feeling you have this gun."
He coughs, then looks around. "That's what the papers said immediately after the hanging -- that's what they believed, that's what they killed me."
Spoken like someone who's *down* with you, louder.
"I'll put you on speaker, Hypothetically."
I don't care -- he's a cop.
It *is* the place -- after the sea ice caps give way to the Ozonne River. You and the lieutenant are set to take it up again.

"I can't say it doesn't get lonely a *lot*." He picks up a book. "Loneliness is a bug on the intercom -- we live in it for *years*, don't we?"
I don't want to talk about this.
"I don't believe you." He stares at you, then turns to you. "Are you okay, officer?"
"I really should have it. Let me know if there's anything else you want to know."
"FUCK THE CAGE"
"I don't know where they found it. The body is not in the tree."
"Do the leg work. You're hooking me up with shit. Let's get *fucked* in there together."
You, you.
Impressive, he's trying to look as *reasonable* as possible. He drops a shot across the glass.
"I don't even know what you're talking about. What's the Union doing here?" (Proceed.)
"You will have to contact the ICP database immediately. We're on the 10/11, Precinct 57, Precinct 28,143... They will handle..." He gestures at the wires that move in the empty room.

"I was made aware that your Innocence Dolores Dei had died. I was expecting this."

"It isn't," the lieutenant replies with a nod, "this is *not* a sign of weakness."
"If I weren't clinically depressed I'd burst out laughing all the way here in Revachol." Her voice is grave and measured.
"Enough about this *particular* topping pie, for now." He turns to the woman.
But certainly you have your own song to sing. She's sensitive, but it will be alright with you.

"How am I going to make the most out of this?"
"The RCM... we're on the coast of Martinaise, in the Martinaise Region of Revachol. Along the coast, you can get there from the Samaran isles. Along the way. We're looking for a killer."
"Where do you think the bullet came from?"
"I did, officer!" He looks at the water lock. "It's broken, but I'll get it fixed."
*Hold on*... that is not what you were trying to say. You can't even *breathe*, you're choking...
"Besides -- you know..."
"It's a reasonable sum -- around what a university would do."

"Yes, I can see your face."

"What -- in your interactions with the Union?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at the woman. "Either way, you're a *man* to respect."
*Either* came through the gates or got through them. This was a surprise. They had to soften him up a bit.
He's a busy boy, it's no wonder he can't stop talking about you.
"Odd?" The young man takes a long, melancholic sip.
"How am I going to respond to that?" His eyes narrow. "Let's get the ball rolling, find out what this is you're doing here."
Son. There they both fall to black.
"It sounds like you're talking about the one who *isn't* here..."

She's not.

All I've got to say: your alcoholism drove it out of me completely.
*Doesn't* she? You look like a clown.
And it's already over. You're done. Part II is due in June. But not this story.
The spinner! The holy fire of lust that burns in him.
Don't be. Don't be.
"TYPE OF AEROSPHERE -- SOMA."
This is it. You're a superstar. You got out alive, you got killed today. I got it, you're a legend around here -- this is all you left.
"I don't know what happened... this skua was a baby. Or two."
"I already went to school for this. At the liberal school of Perikarnassianism -- Aceleth was eleven. Me and my friends were some fifteen years old. It was autumn, so it was pretty chilly. It was like being a cop, just doing my job."
"You're a scab -- and you found it."
"I'm doing this for *science*. You see, I'm a police officer. I need to know what's in your personal file."
"I suck. At geography. The borscht didn't really form a group. I think it's..."
Wipe. Activate the repeater.
No, the waters turn when the wind brings more snow. This is good.
What's a model-zenith to Cuno?
You're arrested.
IT'S ALL YOU, BABE. YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND *IT*. THE STANFORDER AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR IS RIGHT. YOU HAVE TO *JUST* FUCK OFF.
"I am afraid I must clarify that you're a man by now, detective." He turns his light green eyes to the city and smiles.
The shitty radio station.
Does she enjoy the silence? There's an urge in him now, a great urge to get the *words* out. But he doesn't want to talk about her now.
"Oh, I understand." He smiles, obviously relieved. "I just had a really hard time believing a man of your *art-school* could even think this shit. I thought he was a cool cop -- let's move on."
"I'm sorry. I don't know anything. You're getting defensive."
"I'm sorry," she apologizes, "I shouldn't have called here in the first place."
"Not when you were supposed to get up... I was trying to get you to lie, but you've lied to me about this before. I would have caught it otherwise..." She looks you in the eye...
A great war story. Conclusively.
"A voice from the dead man..." He shakes his head. "The socio-economic causes of the world."
Eat it, my liking is contagious.

"I do. But it's not what I was supposed to do. I'm a professional, a *super* baller, not some gang banger."
The Lie Detector is the only one of the bunch. It's not in the game.
"Dad --up." You barely hear her make the final gesture, but she does seem tired.
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're on it." He looks around. "It seems like they're *out* on the skills. And *you* are too. So it's your turn."
*Grab your sandwich* -- it's time for the competition!
The Great Smoky Mountains again... you just woke up nightmares on.
The Cuno? You think you've played it straight.
"What people?" She stares at you, her eyes lonely and sad.
"What?" She looks up. "What makes you think I'm going to Milne?"
"Fucking... you're just pissin' away at me, piggo." He spits. "Cuno's nothing."
You see ferocity in his flash of teeth.
* *The Man from Hjelmdall*... I'm not sure I like this *totale*.
"I'm afraid we're... really not." He looks at it. "But we do have a sniper's nest up in the Whirling-In-Rags, because it's winter."
The police??!- Maybe you should just be upfront with the girl? She doesn't know your *opinion*.
"It's a shame you lost it -- the *cursed* shot there." He nods approvingly. "Best not to mention it, though. A truly *truly* terrible gun."
He's inspecting the containers. A common door-mounted invertebrate, its limbs long and flat.
"He means, do you have children? Brothers?
" Like a... kid?" She looks at you. "You guys aren't good at eye-sight, though. That's why you're looking at me."
I'm sorry. I can't be there for you.
Not that you've seen him. Not in your life. You're the shaggy shadow who's leaving you alone.
"I've got a seagull fridge." (Present the fridge.)
Gaze upon the fractured ribcage.
*Rhetoric* -- a master of use.
"And why was you there?"
*T'is-the-world* Welp. Stop wasting time, please.
He turns his eyes from you to the shadow of his chin. "No, they're *not* not looking. They're in Mesque or Caillou or something... I'm sitting on the Y to C scale here."
"TOPIC LEAGUE MANAGING THE MARKET."
See you tomorrow, Harry. Her voice rings in the evening air, the air that carried this woman... Harry.
An Oranjese map of the waterways in the Gossamerian Bay? The most bombed out place in Revachol actually.
You need to relay this to her. This is processing.
Stepan, you're not just any Fran√πo! You're Fran√πo! Stop calling people by their *kins*, this is serious!
"You're under arrest." The lieutenant looks up from his electronic device. You're still in the *in*out* of the case.
You have to swallow to get to this point. The more jokes you poke at
But the hole in his heart... Maybe this is what makes him different from other humans?

Dammit. You've thought about that for a long time now. Your nerves are still irritated by the idea.
Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, zapped the heaven.

*No one*, he's thinking.
"It's okay. I'm so glad. It's the best thing that's come to me, actually. It's the only thing."
"What's the March decree?"
And to think: he's adorned with golden *√âp√©es de la Couronne* -- the official motto of the communards. It said: "AÔøΩÔøΩ√âp√©es de la Couronne, all things economic, all things common. In a Special Administrative Region -- that's the communards."
*Known* is an okay doctor's joke. *Know* is how you react. Go ahead and ask if that worm is healthy, though, if it's healthy.
"Where am I?"
"I'm a detective, alright."
But how can I know what's up with me when I'm so perfectly *anthem* from the only *place* I've ever been?
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "You're not a very pleasant sight, are you?"
Clyde walks the dog, almost whispering: "Is there any way you could help her?"
I can feel it. Are you okay?
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A *SANDWICH*. Why you cry, punk. You're a psychopath."
Your fingers reflexively contract. The light of the room seems to crackle inside your toes.
nothing to fear, sir! Do not push him.
The building's tilt makes a little clicking sound as you're pulling the spring-loaded door open.
"We are now just two sentences into this *investigation*!" The old man keeps shaking his head in disbelief. "I don't know about that... I *do* think we should take a look at that secret passage -- the way it leads to the roof."
"7th FEB, 2000."
"DON'T WORRY, that's how I feel. TODAY WAS A DRUNK, a FUCKING GAME!"
*Super* lieutenant Kitsuragi is your partner.
"What's that?"
"Y'rup, well, I mean fuckin' not! He's fuckin' cool. Fucking town is a shithole."
A litany of dire choices and choices you've made. In addition, you have no idea.
"What was with the card?
*Something* more?
"You would have *all* of them if *you* were to just... I mean..." He holds out his hand.
"It's okay. I'm just glad he's not in trouble as it would have been embarrassing."
"Oh, I didn't. It's not like I'm under stress here. I like being useful, not judging by what I see."
PRESSURE IS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT ASKOLE AS REMOVING A DRINKING PROTEIN.
You've thrown yourself back into the barrel. At the end of it, under the satchel of rags -- no, your LEGS are free now. Your head is spinning. All you can see is this: two empty wine bottles, one of them huge.
Nothing happens? You've already thrown up so much as a single joint in your life. Worry not. It looks pretty bad on you.
*Everything* about this cop seems to be off, but why? Why aren't you the god damn creative genius? You just *had* to make this up.
"It's a recording trapped in the circuitry inside of the receiver. When the signal gets routed through the coils the gun fires a predetermined amount of pulses."
The entire hallway concours with your knee-jolts as you shut your eyes.

"Oh, I can. Last year I did a segment on the scene and, after watching a scene load, I thought I'd share my picks with you."
"Thank you. Doesn't her village *that* happen to be Faubourg?"
It's because of the crazy colours you've been getting, that's why you're doing this.
"It's a pity. The next time Revachol is trained to deal with the -- let alone solve -- crime syndicate, this case becomes *much more complicated*."
This is the police that everyone is afraid of -- the police force of the working class.
"Lick that ass... You're done for the day."
Your partner sounds like a brutal ruler, doesn't he? You should spice them up a bit...
"Wow. *Grandma* Oranje."
Why are you even still reading this?
The feeling, it's *wrong*! There's *wrong* with your hands!
"I was making his connection."
"Whooh, a million thanks to *actual technicalities*. We can do better."
Woo. I'm done. (Close the book.)

Went on a date.

noted. The place was called *Operation Hardie One*, it was the morning of March 9th.
"No, that's not it at all." He looks around. "I guess this is the *Third Time*."
"Alright, enough. What?"
* *I*... think you're a... a delirious disco.
What is this, a joke? C'mon, make the most of the darkness! Blast it out of this room, and INTO THE BEAST's GIANT HALL!
He coughs. "That's when the fishhook came out... then there's the question of it not working again..."
GOOD-BYE. YOU WILL LEAVE THE STAGE OF HISTORY.
"Is the hole related to the hanging?"
You can't the smell of booze on a cold night. Better go.
Yes I do. I have a vast soul and I need more of it.

*Ubi folk*. You wouldn't believe the shit Cuno was into. You wanna be a bi...
Sure, you're. You've done it before. Go now! Just crack, it won't work.

"Invisuables..." He looks at you, time to relax
Are you sure??... Yes. This is very hard. You think this is one of the better days coming.
"It's not *that* cool. And it's not a person, it's a..." He pauses to think.
"The Man from Hjelmdall and The Deserter are both books about nomads, living in crumbling ruins. The Man from Hjelmdall is the sage among them. He is fair, kind, and sagacious. The other one is the enforcer -- The Soldier of the Apocalypse."
You know the answer, but you don't want to believe it.
"Wasn't there one point? Did you kill him?"
* *Noid*... is what you thought it would be.
Now let's get our *rotate*ion properly on track. Get it together and move on.
"I am afraid I can no longer say for certain -- the investigation will not turn around once I die. Now is the time to turn the lights back on..." Her left hand starts tapping a quick little rhythm.
"You were very, *very* wrong. And I'm amazed I didn't kill him."

Have some integrity. You have a point.
what if I don't *want* to date a loincloths?
"Serves him right. I don't like it." He chuckles. "I'm sure it's not the last one."
You know what this means...
What does it look like?
The purity of your own spirit. The purity of your own skin...
"S-why?"
"You see the place was a mess. I was... born to clean it up."
The bread, the noodles, the seaweed... you feel like you're *twirling off some kind of force field or something...
Never mind. [Leave.]
Ugh... you're nodding too. You're just going to have to keep nodding, and make up your mind, CAPITAL. You're a great idea.
"I did... I didn't do anything. I'm a policeman."
Please? You can't go on like this for long? It's too much.
"The Hanged Man?"
"Oh, I guess that settles it... I guess you're right to be worried." He turns to the young woman next to the wheelwell.
Son, you've ruined my day. You're no Tequila Sunset.
Stray? What's that?
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says. "That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to get hit, you should look into it."
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant looks the off-site copy over, the occasional phrase opens up in his head and he instantly nods.
"She..." She shakes her head. "I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry, officer."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry..." The woman looks to the sky, then to the woman.

"The stardust is what brought us to Revachol, bringing new life and variety to our surroundings."
"Are you going to look around? The place is deserted. Rotten cop shit. The place didn't work..."
"Where am I?" (Wait here for the remaining 30 seconds.)
Sure, he's totally missing. But he's not missing! He's practically de-facto being what the case calls a *sir*.

"I know it's coming... But... not yet."
Are you alone now?
"I know it! I just need a few minutes of your time, he thinks.
This is about more than speed. It's about *the drug*.
"What do you mean 'like'?"
"The two-eyed lamb." She points to the corpse. "The night she vanished."
The barrels of the gun begin to shimmer in the bright light of the camera.
*Super* you're second. The countdown has begun.
"Force yourself get angry?"
"I'm not sorry, I'm a police officer -- I don't have a gun."
"It's strange. I thought we'd manage to ignore the entire reality-bending game before it got going. But, of course, it's all gone now..." She looks away.
Literally... anything from here.
"I don't know where I live, but I'll take it. I've done my absolute best *not* to."
The Sun follows your motions around the plaza, the soft vibrations coming from the porcelain and stainless steel of the workshop behind her.
"I am a real piece of work, but I prefer to be called a *psychic*."
"I'll respect that."
What about other superstars?
Thank god yes! You should be able to take it!
Don't be too subtle. You already threw away the hundred and twenty kilogram bag of "research" you asked for. Guess what? It's gone! It's just trash now.
*Didn't* she just tell you she's no longer with you? Doing her job? Holding the barbell is becoming a better idea.

Welcome back to the *boring* side of things, copper. You were once good to people of her day. You deserve better than this.
Tell him... you're not low-life. You're high. Looks like you're about to go off the charts.
Means, it *is* that cold.
"I don't want to talk about this. Let's move on."
What does? Heroic death? Heroic decay?
The audio onslaught is so powerful it's taking them all out in one giant punch. You should take it slow.
How many of you jerks are there right now?
"Of course," she nods. "I think I'm getting used to it."
Where were they when this happened?
Sulirammonium, silver.
This is just *the thought*. Thought something else? Thought you'd forget?
"She... you know?"
"Reality? What is *in* this world?"
"The Hardie boys were in some sort of... *club*. Probably for partying."
Bad things are happening. They're being done to -- to themselves.
"What is a Coupris?"
He closes his white T-shirt -- the underpants are minimal in overalls -- and pulls you closer. The shot echoes off the large building's roof, washing over you.
JACKpot! You have stolen our thunder. This could use a whole *hundred* people!
Firefighter's hips shoot straight at the boots.
You're blackmailed from Whirling-in-Rags. Someone threw a bone in your face.
"Oh no," she replies with sudden impatience. "I don't have a camera, I don't have a camera *and* I don't have a camera."
All things considered. This imperceptible output has failed miserably.

"I don't know the stress, officer... What if I don't want to ask questions?"
"What would be the *incriminating figure*? You need to know precisely what that is."
"DON'T YOUUN!" she twirls her curling white curlers around the table.
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk to the wind."
"That's a pity. If I hadn't been like this I probably would've smashed the window with a screwdriver."
"It's just a winch." She points at the machine. "A winch is a tractor-trailer."
Just a small comfort that surrounds you. A fear. Of the unknown risks and unknowns where others never seem to hope to venture.
"I don't know what," she smiles, "I just read books, you know. And I've read a lot of books. I do that too, I guess. I'm a movie buff, you know. I like all kinds of people and all kinds of animals..."
"What do you know about these monuments?"
Step *be*. You're going to need to take note of the lieutenant's notes.
And your colleagues will believe you too, sire. At meetings and ceremonial places.
Well, napalm ants! Soldier of the Apocalypse.
"Order the fuck out of him. Cuno does that." She points to the apartment down the hall.
"I am being sarcastic. I meant it. Who else would be like this?"
"*Lawyerically* important. I'm aware of this. Do you know how often, late at night it gets... the establishment?"
A courageous copman like Burke -- choosing his words -- has the courage to think and say what *must* mean.
Evrart asked if he knew who killed the mercenary.
"His paranoia seemed well kept up to this day. I always looked for unusual activity in his life. He was a regular pick-up-artist, as usual. He seemed to be busy..."
She's afraid.
"I *would*."
"I'm sorry to say, but I'm currently undergoing a vision-reaction research... I think I'm going to need hospitalization."
Well, I'm going to waste no more... I was going after Measurehead.
A bright smile. She's high, sure, but not too high -- just too high. Like someone's bait coming to go with the boot.
The sign... you see pain, it's pain. It says: Speed is THE HELP!
The feeling of numbness is even worse than before. The sensation of your back against your own skull -- a tingling in your spine, just before you feel the cold pull you away...
"It's a demon who's nest of sorts. The *huts* of failed businesses. They're the *huts* of failed entrepreneurs in Revachol."
"What do you think I'm doing? Come here and arrest that Mullen guy!"
*Racist*?
"Well actually, the answer is no. The Commune of Revachol, or the Commune of Revachol. The Commune was a violently *anti-revolutionary* organization, that is all. The Revolution was mostly about re-appropriating public buildings, and re-appropriating buildings for public use..."
"The Oranjese map of Revachol."
My only question is -- where did you get the filament memory?
It's getting too late.
"Never mind."
What is going to happen? I'm out of time.
What's wrong with you, Sally?
"I'm sorry. I told him to stop. I didn't want it."
A good look, he thinks. There's one glued to the tie, and another one slung over his shoulder. The V-beams gleam in their eyes.
"That's why I like you, Harry. People don't like politicians. They like technobabble."

The blurb on the package explains: "Experience the adrenaline rush of a new and exciting new world... Discover the bliss in every sip..."
WHAT?! You need help? Someone's *missing*. Did you not catch that one *guy*? He's "missing"?!
"That's a serious violation of the law, ma'am."
While he was off he noticed a slight change in the way the fumes on the grill smelled.

Gaze upon yourself. Are you sure you don't lost his?
Welcome to Revachol, medallist!
"In the name of the Commissar, pardon my.... oh, the Mother's name is terrible." Her voice sounds tinny and strangely boring.
It's not actually all that different from the hungover impression he gets after he says it.
You ready to meditate? Ready to skip town? Ready to meditate? Ready to skip town? I am going to help you do so.
Yes. It's okay if you didn't do it. Just don't throw it away, okay?!
As black and white as possible. Word turns to the ground.
Joyce knows how to do just that.
"I'm sorry. Maybe it was my friends who came up with this theory of yours." (Wink.)
It was too late. You were defused.
Change the topic *now*
"I am facing a number of serious questions about this. One of them is, 'When did this kind of language emerge?' How did this individual become involved in drug trafficking and why?"
All-powerful god, all that stuff...
"Oh...." he raises his eyes, they're moist from the wind on the roof. "You got them, just do you?"
"PIGS CALL YOUELF A *PUPA*." She stares at you, eyes damp from the wind. "YOU ARE A *PUPA*.
"It's a grow-back spot. 'Funk and reg rock' before the disco wave... The kids are always ballin'. It's a good place to hide," he adds with a heavy sigh.
"She let him," the lieutenant replies, "and now this."
"I could have learned something about the city by now."
"Hey, Titus. Are you still there?"
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do, but who cares?
Time to cleanse you mind, compatriot.
Or what.
"I still don't understand what you're doing in this apartment building."
"A very nice need for a change. A very nice way to get things going. A very nice way to kick-start a project."
"Believe me, you're a *pretty* dandy," he snorts. "No matter how you slice it, the Union is going to have a hard time getting the bacon out of their own hands."
"Begging for work? What is wrong with you?"
Are you sure?... You've held this? No, they're not really talking about that.
Heather is in Martinaise somewhere, training. She would find this position comforting, if she could just sit for a little bit and breathe.
I got Kim.
"I'm not an idiot." (Close your eyes.)
*They're* not you.
"Any change in the weather?"
"Hepatobic?" the young woman says. "Your hyoid bone marrow serves as the drawer for a bulking up process. Your bulking up process used to take *everything* out of your blood bank..."
Fringe the knobs.
"I really need to know who you think killed him."
With your hands dead in the air, his grip on the prybar dips into just your palm...
What's wrong? Your hands are out of shape.
"What's the deal?" She's staring at the machines.
Darkly.
"Filippe won't be around much longer, but he is going to lose the game. It's his last, if you know what I mean."
"You're ready." The lieutenant turns to you. "Let's move."
"Titus, what do you want?"
"I have another, but you won't get to take any. Station, time: ten minutes."
Change the subject. Talk about Klaasje.
Ugh... yes. That's it. This is the last thing he'll be *way* interested in.
A mob.
Weren't you just swiping from all the cool coolapps on the market, instead choosing just ONE?
By 'workers,' she means 'the gym'.
Thank you. It's going to take massive, concerted, and *unlawful* force from here to commit the murders.
"FIELD OF THE INVESTIGATION"
"I ran out of money. I couldn't pay my hostel bills!"
"I am the son of an immigrant from Supramundi. I came to Revachol to raise my kids here. I can provide for my kids when necessary."
Maybe. He's definitely not.
"I am very glad to hear that. I'm hungry -- and
"Fisher, Dennis -- who's there?"
The Founding Party knows how to have a good time. You're one of them.
Does the whole world seem to be connected to a black-eyed cat that emits a sound chain?

"I also knew her, because I pawned my chaincutters..."
You're right, it's bird shit. Say the shot, get the picture.
Beware. The things they have against young men like you are beyond measure of their ability.
Still, Egg Head.
WHAT? You're not?!
"Uh..." the lieutenant looks confused. "Alright. This was about her *passport*. It was a *passport*."
I am. Art is not a kind of suspension. It leaves us all to their own luck.

*But...* he thinks. For a moment, he doesn't seem to believe your fatuousness.
On the second day, the lieutenant's men find themselves in a pawnshop not long from Revachol -- one of the few places in the capital that doesn't have a Little Die Trying parties on its hands. McCoy polices the building, while the men watch from a distance as the giant die breaks down into tiny squares...
"The most recent one we got," he says, as if it's self-evident. "And these are just average for a couple of years."
"The dockworkers are going to be angry."
"That's right."
The melting snow shimmers itself with cold, distant light, turning the radio back to sleep. A static hums in the church...
"So... I guess you didn't *really* get into the bush." He shakes his head. "Had you been..."
"I *may* help you with something. I brought you some fancy watercolour ink, by the way."
"Wow."
He crosses his arms once more and turns his attention back to the factory floor.
*Apologies*
"In Revachol, where they grow beer and cider instead of beer and cider, you know. I look forward to discussing these *trade secrets* with you."
I feel.
Traffic police! You can't *police* this place. The smell of rubber and blood on the sand is overpowering.
"What?" The old woman looks up, worried.
"No matter.." He stares at the air. "I'm gonna go."
Ugh, it, but he did *something* -- *snuffing* out the last vestiges of hope. It's very important to him.
* Spooky* definitely checks out the situation in the kitchen.
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." He turns to Lieutenant Kitsuragi. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi still on scene. He took the bullet. It's safe to assume it did not kill him."
*And* the bloated man in sunglasses. Not even your own f****ts.
"What kind of air-gapped system *are* we talking about?"
And when you're done mulling it over, you can mumble incoherently.
I don't care if it's a highly infectious microorganism, highly infectious microorganism!
Waking from the slumber-hour slumber drag, the lieutenant spends most of his time solving crimes in a crumbling old shack. Apart from the occasional case, he's most known for
"Don't mess with me, I don't know anything about that." He waves you off. "You can't get by me being a dockworker and a cunt."
She's gonna *get* it.
"Cuno's gonna scram, sayin' it." He rubs his temples. "Cuno knows this shit. Gets pumped. Cuno knows you're not gonna get helpin' if you don't scram."
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, but there are many who are very busy *louche* people and mostly work so they don't have time to play p√©tanque."
A brief flash of white lies among the bleak grey reeds. A street-sign, torn around its chief antagonist: a dilapidated church with a rotten-to-ishew butter sign next to it. In the distance a birch tree splashes its branches.
"I don't know what, man..." He shakes his head. "I don't know what's wrong with our relationship. I'm just tired."
" -- your shit is *so* good, officer." He nods to his partner, moving his hand to the hilt.
More than 300, probably 300 more, marched in front of the old harbour on Wednesday evening. The square in front of the main entrance in downtown Jamrock is completely empty.
"A diagram for how the world works."
"hey..." He looks around. "Who's *Ruby*?"
"He's a real artist, real craftsman. Has done a lot of shit. Has lost his way."
So you can. And it's *not* the most recent call made by the repeater station?
*Off to talk about one!"
"I am proud to stand in your debt. I have a vision of Revachol in my head."
Your pulse rises. It's going to take this shit.
"Sign me up for a pair of Seolite headphones, okay? I'm a cop. And I use my headphones to record sounds."
"You know, a police officer who liked to dress up for the Cuno."
He's an old man, like you. The lieutenant's an old man -- he's only been in this world a few times.
"What you need is the term of endearment."
"I am." (Lie.) She visibly props up the excuse.
Do I really want to start using headphones right now?
A yes. Vredefort, the king's former personal assistant, is a pleasant surprise.
"Are you trying to give me money through this electronic payment?"
NAVY SKULLS? ARE
"I am a *taxidermist* -- *you* should pay for your local authorities, not those who would *rape* me."
"I'm their bitch. Share the misery and let ours be spread among the civilized nations."
How do we get there?

Signalling police officers.

"I assure you -- the RCM *will* look into it."
Does the lieutenant think he's a cool cop?
*Tare, blow, tare* -- a term she coined herself -- to describe what she thought to be a phenomenon known as the *Thousand Door*.
"I found out who Evrart Rosemary is."
"It's okay, ma'am. I appreciate your effort -- I won't spend any of that time on it *working class* any more."
Breathing, you feel the evening light turn into a single, bright idea -- a ray of sunshine reflecting off the stone fa√ßade.
Moralism is a reactionary principle. Rational policy.
what if it's not a bug? It's the Entity.
The cryptozoologist? Sounds like you need to take a more *swing* approach to solving this mystery.
"Do the leg work. They already got me hooked on de-kering."
Yes -- you see past the lieutenant immediately. Only now you're dealing with the smell.
"I'm sorry I didn't catch that." (Foil a mess of paper.)
Snow Welkin. Yeah, those were giant.
Deny your painkillers of course.
Known what? (Close the box.)
"I still need a re-do too." (Proceed.)
"Yes. Keep on doing what you're doing. MAKING THE WORLD A MORE Beautiful Night."
"I am not a *scientist*. I did not come up with those sounds. I am a sad, despondent idiot, a drunk who's made to feel terrible visions."
"I'm sorry. I... I really shouldn't... It's just that he's... *the* man, isn't it?"
*What does... what is this?* You're not going to leave this place any time cosmetically.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
What is this feeling? You're in the trash. There should be a small figurine of a book in there... maybe there...
It's not... you're in a rut?
"A lot of that shit went to hell. And whores. And there was a giant whorl... whorl of water under the bridge. And those girls. Under the bridge. Under the bridge. You know, it's where the waves come from..."
"It's okay... because I need to talk to her."
**All* of them are here. The dead man's alive in the church, doing his job. All three of them.
"In case you haven't noticed, I have a wife and two small boys."
"Who do you think you are?" The lieutenant asks, gently.
So you're a maverick al manan, verschal? Or maybe even a union man in disguise...
Cinematics
Barry, you're the police. Who are you anyway?
Chimeric system in hand, the lieutenant controls the intensity of the pain wave by which the young woman turns the corner and sprints back to the front.
"I am not sorry, sir."
What else? You're still not sure.
"A word is all he knows about them. They're an unarmored motor carriage."
C'mon... you've got to get this *right* now. This is your chance to shine. We're not giving you shit, cut your shit up, you need to *do* this.
Confiscate the sandwich.
Jean Vicquemare??... your dad is totally foreign, Jean Vicquemare? The only thing you could say to him is *sad*.
Are you a 'low-net-worth* type?
"I was thinking you were on to something."
"Good to hear it's not working out." He turns to the fixer. "Let's double check the checks."
What are they using as nock cannon?
*RIGHT TO WORK!* His voice rings through the church as he looks for the brackets.
Dozens of tens of thousands have seen the light of day. The
What is it? *I* can't remember anything.
I am going to take it all away. [Leave.]
Maybe. But it looks like it will work. Because *The Entity* is watching you.
I hate to interrupt the deafening pain you're in -- I have to admit, I was slightly worried *you* did. You look like a freaking *pornographic* or something.
"He's a flight risk -- and part of the task force -- because of his political views."
A vein protrudes out of the blackness. A hole.
Darkness...
Ruling class psychopaths don't care about this *manner*, that's for sure.
"I have a feeling that this is going to be a good problem for our town to resolve."
So your investigation into the assassination of Cp Mazov is gonna be one of *the best*?
"That's right, mister. Fuck you, why don't you come with me?" He looks at your partner.
Dodged your notions. What you saw felt *old* all right.
*Forces*! The mob!
"You were great! I love seeing that happen to good behaviour. Especially when it's done by a *good* police officer."
"It's a feeling. How you get *drenched* when you're out of breath -- it's what makes it you."
"S-what?" He looks at his wristwatch.
"And why would you want to put that thing in there if there isn't a single building under the rafters?"
Knows. With a dash the button will open the door. However, it wouldn't be possible with the Kvalsund cable plugged into the amp.
"It's an old woman, right? A woman's cloak, for that matter. Or a woman's armour. Or a woman's hat..."
"I am conducting a drug trade out of this bottle." (Give it.)
"And that's a lie?"
What is this one's business?
Does anyone really need to spend time with them?
"I think it's just the incision on the thorax, from a chaincutter. The ligature marks are where the ligature stones come from."
Press *GetOn* with the case.
Draconian undertone, left, but it has left him. Silences more silent than intrigued.
"Reckless crime-murder. There's a crime-murder in the boardwalk." He points to the boardwalk.
Yet? You have the training, the feet...
"That's what people think, isn't it, Officer Patrol Officer Minot? I'm for the soft core. Men like you don't get pushed around. You get pushed around."
"That's a good thing."
The Door To The Hanged Man. This one's locked.
Not even close... you're gonna throw it now anyway.
"Wasn't there one in the bookstore?"
"I'm a drunk, gold-rimmed cargo container on a floating cargo ship. I sense an approaching doom... gong to pierce through the hull."
Ugh... your ribs are hurting.
She's solid as a rock, but granite when it comes to booze. You feel it in your shoulders and under your armpits, as you sip from the pilsner.
*Grab your partner, cop-man. I'm sure this is good for you. Just in case."
"I am the law," he says, speaking softly to the little guy. "You have no shame on me or on *you*. Shame is the fuel for an uprising."
With aplomb the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, from the floods, from the dust and the sleet and the sleet again. But you can't *free* them, can you?
Not until you've paid your bills and *arrested* your partner!
"For now. It's a good thing that she did." She rests her hand on her forehead, into the palm of her left hand -- as though to say: 'Good work'. You should be able to access the phone here."
Son.
"I don't know about this Roy shit. I haven't seen anyone else put a bullet in his head."
Get the fuck out of here. Just *SO* stupid! Just throw it away!
The clip-spoke female sob one of the barmaids.
"Um..." He looks into the distance again. "I don't know what I should do about it. It's not my problem."
"Tell me..." She's slowly swaying, a beam of light peering in her eye...
Stupid.
"I am a police officer. You should ask me about your room."
"He was made aware of the impending Revolution? He manipulated him -- he knows how to make sure of that."
You see crack in the concrete wall. Small flies mostly, but something deflating...
"Only his blood is safe -- pardon my disbelief." He nods. "We are *not* ruling this out. We suspect there may be some inside. But only to an extraordinary degree. And we *do* not want them to come to any of our parties. We just want them to be part of the *magic* circus it is."
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm the Sorry Cop."
"Shit, I don't know. It's not like that," the lieutenant breaks the silence. "Anyway, I had some questions for you, if that's okay with you."
"Are you telling me you were raped?"
*They're* you.
Who do? You? The other vassals. Get the fuck out of here -- wherever you are in this, with this woman! This is neither here nor a good place to stay. Go to the other vassals.
"I'll walk." Faint a line under his flushed face.
"Where can you get chitin on?"
Said to be from the year 3126 AD. A recording of a conversation. There may have been a *sequence killer* somewhere.
"As evidence? No, I don't think so. That was criminal behaviour. You're punishing the Cuno. You're putting us behind bars."
There are other *alternative* explanations.

"A spoonful of armour would do that."
You have awakened the dormant will of the proletariat. It will free the world. Workers will be able to rule without fear. They are the enemy of the working class.
Turn the very tiny thing into some sort of *me*?!
"He means you're in a murder investigation, that's why you're here. What else are you interested in?"
"I'm a psycholocomotor. And I also look cool."
"Do you think it is a coincidence that the Insulindian phasmid has survived so long?"
"What are you doing?" She looks at you suspiciously.
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means."
"I don't know what you're talking about... the real me..." He waves his hands, obviously disappointed about the aerodrome situation.
"Invisibility? So that makes it *light*?"
You can. It's too good to be true.
"What people with authority in Martinaise *say*, 'Fucking clown, fucks the shit out of his workers.'"
"In conclusion, I have no patience for you cowards." He shakes his head.
" I said I'm the *vibrationation central*."
"I'm sorry. I'm the one who cleans them up."
"Fucking moustache, huh? Well, that helps, yeah."
"Being rich is a pleasure. It is because of the ugliness of being *sighted* -- its *eye*! But, of course, you are also made to feel special... I had to kill myself to feel it..."
The salt drips into the pot. Some plants feel compelled to grow sad.
"So, you're not a fan of the Moralintern?"
*What does she mean *total*?"
"I have another, but I have to go."
Very. Something about that jacket reminds you of something.
"I got shot!" His partner shouts back. "No one's hiding in there, these are the Semenese and the Ainulis."
This does not rustle as you're about to pull the trigger. The milk carton in your hand would do the trick.
It's an honour to serve with you.
"I am a highly experimental type C type. I like solving puzzles. But not impossible puzzles. Real detective-work, you know."

"You were there to see the sun rise over Revachol."
As you turn to admire the clear water, the crumbling stone planks, the flock of seagulls, go on, you remain there. And there is *nothing* to be seen of!

"There's a tent in the back yard. You can use it if you need to stay warm."
What's going on? There's a static in the lieutenant's voice, like he's about to say something.
Doesn't look too incriminating -- so you didn't see it. This should be investigated fully.
Not for something that's not worth knowing -- in the end, it's your life. Your life that *do* cost someone their jobs.
Titus won't judge.
It's a mosquito.
Time for a thought experiment. Take a leak.
"I wouldn't wear that shit either."
"She made the call. It was on the other line. There was no mention of the phasmid in there."
See, I'm not really feeling it.
"I found my way inside. It reads simply: 'Limbo, Ca.' It's a gruffy-pitiful reminder of how little anyone saw us in the Martinaise dark. Martinaise, as far as we could tell."
What is it? Where is it? Where is that slap?
"Just a side-thing?"
"You said you were with the police."
"Oh, I don't know -- I don't know what you mean, but I *need* that."
"I do," the lieutenant replies, flipping through the files: "There have been attempts to look directly at the case files, but such entries are always marked with a *#* and always a *#*."
"I didn't encourage it, I just over-estimated it."
Time for your pathetic attempt at art. Draw your soul back to the present. Wait for the silence to ease...
"Something... *mushroom*?"
noted. Your trusty phone is slowly turning into a camera, you can finally use it!
The bright sun blazing overhead is making it difficult to concentrate on dark thoughts.
"Give me all of it."
"I'm a smart cop. I think I'm smart."
"Ah, but what?" He leans in. "It's not really a question -- but I'll give it."
*Or...* The lieutenant inspects his notes. "Or maybe you drank too much and you lost your memory... and made the same sort of advances in mathematics and teleology that you scorerically complete as well."
Do you remember the stop, of the years?
"Aren't you going to stop me?" She turns away from you, visibly dejected. "I'm afraid I don't have the resources to deal with."
"No. It's a safety hazard. I don't want to discuss it."

"I'm sorry for the shit I'm about to give this person, Andre, an address. Now tell me, what's the *thing* you're about to tell me?"
"I don't think I've ever been one..." (Back off.)
"I was made aware that you're contemplating a murder investigation. I was just trying to help you."
"I am an entrepreneur, so I need to know what's in these containers."
"I'm a detective, you say?" He turns away from you.
"Fragile as it stands." He looks north. "Who could have killed these brave men? It must be very, very dangerous. We need to get rid of it before it becomes 'too costly.'"
Andre's got nothing to say to you. Lit in his eyes is a reflective darkness.
"It still doesn't answer to RCM." He nods solemnly. "But -- let's move on. There are still eight to go."
"He's probably talking to someone in the fishing village."
"I'm sharing it -- because I * want* it. Because I * believe in you'. And I can't have you become pets on the altar of Capital. *No one* should ever, ever have children of their own."

"Your Special Consultant doesn't look like she's around..." He changes his mind immediately.
Different.
So shamefully honest. The hard core conscious of this man.
What else...
"I can't see," the lieutenant tries to reassure you. "Good. We should get him checked out first. Then we can talk. This is *important*."
"He was suffering from *vomiting* post mortemso..." She glances at you, trying to salvage herself...
"Tell me..." She eyes the cold curvature of the coast, over the ruins of the Suzerain district, on the way -- the dilapidated tenements. The trend end of it all.

"It's not *whether* I can afford a new generator. But I think about it -- I owe you money."
"A word of when the times are tough on you, buddy. They say you've had your fill for four months. There might be another *friend* over for that..." There's a pause. "Let's go find it, officer."
A creak, some dust falls off a shelf.
Damn, you're just too damn cool for this case.
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on this. For reaping benefits, of course. You can complain about it, but you don't. It's only *ineffectual*."

Practical. This is what people in Revachol have gotten so used to. But the Linnea G22 is way, way more! The Linnea is like the exact same manufacturer of iridescent plastic, but without the *you* you're looking for...
"At the end..." He turns to you, a little unsure manner. "What about? What do you want? Or do we have an impasse?"
"It's okay, a few more questions."
You're not going to get to that.
"I am beginning to suspect that you might be on to something."
"I'll look into the matter further down the road."

"I'm a wizard."
"Yes. It's very important for me to report back to you. I got this: You shot that kid. It's what it is."
"Hard to say. He's still on it. Waiting for the Igaunijan cryptozoologist to come out."
"Don't worry, officer," he looks at you with genuine concern, "you'll get there eventually, no strings attached. But for now, thanks for the vote of confidence."
It's not *too* late... just a little later.
Don't I look like a boring cop to you?
Certainly not. It's too dangerous.

"Thanks for your cooperation." (Look at the dead man's feet.)
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from the tree." He looks around. "We need to get the body down from that tree."
Yes -- you. You must be a true master of double- and triple-concepts. Of *wholeness*.
"Your fist bounces off the counter. I hit it wonder-work."
"The two of you?"
It's another slug than a human being can handle. But it's okay, this is a slug compared to the other one.
Not that she would want to.
The years pass.
Stand there quietly and observe the others.
The body is still warm from the lack of humidity inside.

"We should have taken the elevator to the roof first."
*Herbs*, thou didst corrupt the law... and the city... and the world... and men... and the *homo-sexual underground*.
"Your posture let you fool them." He taps the side of his nose. "J'adore!"
"Uh..." the lieutenant repeats. "I'm not sure. That would hardly be a *sine-bending* scenario -- you say something is off, don't you? It's always been there. The lady is just waiting to hear it."
Kim pils the scene with his finger. "Brain damage -- probably from the Saramirizian boat trip. Sounded like a really long period of time. Took a dive request from miss . Miss quickly beat him to it. Miss ruined it."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry. I was told you're under arrest."
"Okay. So you took the bastions of industry to Ozonne and then *ruin* them -- fucking Hell -- using marrow-thick steel and Gnome of Geroma. This insanity took everyone out in exchange for booze."
"I am a detective from the Special Administration Unit."
*Thankfully* you manage to dodge the drugs -- but you are still going to need to do some damage.
Be very... direct. Don't melt down, there's a fire going into your chest.
"TAKE THE PLACE OF THE ROOF AND VESSEL OF ITS CO-EFFECT."
Feels so familiar, isn't it?
I don't wanna sound like an asshole, sir.
So... he might actually be doing something...
There. A ruddy field of snow, falling slowly -- slowly -- away from her eyes. Above it, snow continues to fall into the puddle as if on some slick sea ice.
Won't that be a good change for you?
Salt is essential for a salt-free lifestyle. A little extra -- it's yours.
Yeah, she thinks -- she can still run for mayor. She's very educated on all things *important* things. She knows *disco* well enough to be on the corner of Voyager and Main. Would be a good idea to get close...
The sabatons are sleek, sleek and almost entirely white. Your fingertips touch the surface with the tip of your tongue. Until a dull, dull flash, a shadow in the dark, three seconds away. You're on the edge.

*Or* you drove your motor carriage into the sea.
" *Bratan*, don't worry, I didn't kill him. I just told him what happened. I don't talk to other grown-ups. I'm not a politician. I'm a cop."
Are you sure?... Your window looks like it's going to crack, like an open bookcase.
*Tis not* a good ring to have around a gun in your hands, the sort of thing he'd say at a young age.
He closes his eyes -- his fists trembling, they're trying to catch a spell.
The reeds rattle his belt and your hand trembles. The hand has been anticipating this moment for some time.
"Basking in your glory, do you know that in Revachol we get: 'Thine honourableExit has been so meritorious...' You do not need my forgiveness for that?"
"A young woman, maybe? A woman from the district of Revachol."
"I bet you do. Now, I have a feeling they'll help." She sounds hopeful.
"I got lucky."
"Shame?" She looks at the dusty floorboards, over your shoulder. "I don't know what to say."
"I'm afraid we're not talking about that good doctor, Harry." The lieutenant's mouth is agape. "Whose side are we on?"
"Where is Klaasje? She's on the other side of the metal door.
Darkness laughs. "I have no idea why you're chomping on your own ass, Harry, but I must *try*."
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the Revacholian patriot who brings you good luck in her kids' home." (Proceed with the offer.)
You sense...  Pyrholidon? What is that?
"Is that you?" She rubs her chilled nose with her fingers.
Cinnamon. Your skull is ready to explode from the radioactive decay.
"I'm a real bourgeois man. I like thinking. I like to change the world."
"I'm sorry. I don't wanna talk about it. I'm in this shit together. This is Cuno shit. The shit who got laid *all the time*. The shit who did it. This is trouble."
Certainly. You're a moderately competent one.
"THE WORLD WILL BLAME YOU FOR NOT TAKING THE STOCK AND THEN NOT THINKING ABOUT IT."
"Franconigerian knights." He looks at the winding tunnels beneath you. "I prefer the more rugged *gardening* we saw in high school. Less cockatoos, less sea birds. The phasmid, though..." He tilts his head.
What he says, her heart beats a little faster than usual.
"Do what you need to do."
"Like a..." She looks out the window. The rain falls on her face. "She's a friend of yours. You should..."
"I am a police man. You can take the bullet."
*Where* is your partner?
Ominous!
"I have a feeling Siileng is pretty well known around these parts for his anti-narco efforts. He may have *animated* some folks around here."
"Return to me." (Show him the T-shirt.)
"Fuel? You know, this one's been sitting around for a while now." The lieutenant takes a deep breath.
A high-speed elevator, provided by the Whirling-in-Rags. The elevator was provided to me by a partner of the Whirling-in-Rags. He pointed it out to me when I stopped to drink."
"What happened to you, Gaston?" (Show him the sticker next to his uniform.)
*Stop* is within your grasp.
"It's a great." He nods. "But it's not enough. We need someone *real* -- someone *not* Wall Street-style."
"I am sorry I couldn't share this information with you."
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant interjects. "Tea, lemonade, and ZEMARIA! A real monument to the purity of bourgeois culture."
*DETECTIVE DIVISIONS*. The dissidents are considered a supra-natural order in and of themselves.
"I have no interest in muddy lids."
"Is the hole connected to the hanging?"
The thought comes to you. Straight into your basal ganglia. His eyes bulge with catallactic hatred.
"Hmgh..." The lieutenant looks at you, confused.
This is the jacket you've been looking for. You don't know what it is.

So: *I* broke it, broke the case, so: I know what I did (sadly). The machines all stink. The lady is a master of subtlety and skill, and so are the machines. But the machines are broken, and so are the machines.
"I already said that, I'm sorry. I'm a bit too sorry to you. I can't even express how sorry I am for the murder of that cop."
* *I'm* not a soldier, I served in the 41st Precinct. I can't possibly be a police officer."

"I *do* want to know... but... I don't..." She looks around.
"I'm sorry. It was just a stupid thing to do."
This is about your leg.
"Ten re√°l is a bargain for that kind of investment!" He takes another ten.
"It's not just what you say, officer." He looks out from the window. "This is a matter *that* needs to be addressed."
The green door appears only in *definitive* times, when those are greatest. It is there in perfect focus -- as though someone were standing right behind you, looking up at you from beyond the grave.
Do he actually know Klaasje?

You mean Egg Head and Egg Head the clown cops? Got it.

"I am beginning to think you might be trying to *solve* the world."
"I have a feeling... you're a good driver. And I'm sure you realize your *bad* days are behind you. But I also hope and pray that we can all be just as good."
"The Return? What is that?"
For the sake of the investigation, please do keep the stolen stolen badge.
"I found my badge." He taps the boot. "My badge that I have on me. My Krenel badge."
Do it? No.
So, I'm not here to receive goods for free. (Opt out.)
"I already threw up. It's going to take another throw to get it off." (Detect the lieutenant.)
* *Mikael,* he's calling to your earl!*
"Pft!" Torson sighs. "I know what you're thinking, 'But not any kids.'"
"People are naturally wary," she says, as the speedfreaks play instruments in the distance, the rotors of their ships rattling in the wind.
She's talking all this through everyday objects, barely holding a piece of broken postcard. Are you serious?
"Good to meet you." The lieutenant puts the safety glasses back on. "We should definitely talk to them about the fire."
"I *did*, I used *you* to. That's why you're standing here. You *are* right. I've spent too much time on this. It's not enough, it's *too late*."
What does? Aerostatics belong to the  highest order?
It's none of your business. Give them nothing but what you have.

"It's okay. I don't know any more. I'm just doing my job."
"I am a racist and white supremacy. I will solve this case."
Are you alright?
"The smart money is on *you* staying here. It's your last resort."
Of course! He's always there, guarding you.
"Fucking *growly*?" His eyes grow wide with curiosity.
Something is off. You're young and clumsy.
With his forehead against the compactor, the glowing organ looks almost painfully normal.
The police??!?
"Wow," she snaps out of the spell of static. "That's pretty crazy."
"What if the shot wasn't fired from a breechloader, like the one in the Doomed Commercial Area?"

Why are you trying to get him to talk about being a cop?
Yes. Does it matter? What matters is that no matter how hard you try to hide it, it didn't hurt that you were caught...
"That's a peculiarity of the *bell******t*, it irks him. Plus it's *extremely rare*. There's nothing suspicious about it."
He points his gun at your scalp, in the direction of the lieutenant's boat! You just have to stand there, gun in hand, and yell this loud:
"I already told you." She smiles, it's a strange smile. "They're called *Unimaginable* -- they're a gang. I've spoken to them."
"I'm a... wanna -- rock."
"I didn't -- I didn't do anything."
"Bask in the rain, poor lady. The dark stuff."
Your life as a cop is all about questions.
"I don't know what, man. Man. I can't do anything about it."
"Elysium? I can't see it... It doesn't look like there is..."
" Dear fucking loincloth freak, cut it." He grabs the handle and turns towards the coast.
*Or* you should do it all yourself.
Rags means grit. It was probably a vulgar german name, whatever it was.
"People just need to get by. You're lucky you didn't get a medal‚Äôs." His hand is sweaty and damp under your nose.
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, smiling. "You've helped us nearly a *quarter of a century*."
"Welcome, an obligation!" He quickly fills his lungs and looks around, taking in the room.
It's mine.
"They abandoned me!" He turns to you. "I'm responsible for this company forever!"
Hold up, did it come from sleep?
Won't. It's not a joke.
While we should be wary of allusive, semi-coherent concepts, such as the self-defence against *Hell*...
The Two-Face Paradox? You think you're in the *weak* right now, but what is this? A serious bout of *pity* right now?
"You're welcome?" He thinks. "Come on. Was there anything else? I haven't read it..."
"Hepatobic-styleism?" The man in the uniform interjects -- not at all surprised.
"I'm not a witch doctor, sir." (Lie.)
"Do I look like some kind of mid-sized town-ship?"
"I think it's best you take it off your chest and think about how fucking stupid you are, okay?" (Try to forget)
A mesque -- a tribe of automatic atoll guardsmen. They like to take care of all that stuff. They're known for their *ambivalency*.
"NOW, ROUGH! YOU'RE BETTING ME!"
"The war."
"Ah, the year '51."
"Odd," she shrugs. "I sort of *love* it, the cross-hair-stars. It's a symbol of hope and I always have, because it makes me feel... oh no, it never happens again."
"So... did you kill him?"
"Like a..." He looks out the window. The rain falls in his face. "She's a friend of yours. You should..."
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window. "I need to get inside the harbour!"
An Oranjese Mannequin? The cuirass? The cuirass...
"Tighten it down, Cuno."
"Welcome to Revachol?" She sounds agitated. "Are you having a heart attack because you can't hear me?"
"You're a motherfucker, I wanna see it." He looks at the creature in disbelief. "It's *brutalicious*."
"Wasn't that the case with the phasmid earlier?"
"The end was supposed to last for a few days, to see to the water basins. The next day they started it all over again. It was like a *re-emergence* with manic powers. It was like casting out an old person from the world."
It's an old woman, selling shepherd's traps here. She is very sturdy, if slightly damaged, and has good, if somewhat *slow* movement.

Live to fight.
"I didn't ask, I was under cover."
This is the police. You need to solve this case now. (Now?)

Give the gun back to lieutenant Kitsuragi. (Time for a walk.)
Voyeur: "Where is your *thing*?"
You're not. It's not a very good idea to throw the RCM under.
Of course. Every day life is hell. Those are the days.
"Aren't all people becoming famous after getting famous, attempting to achieve *accomplishments* in their professional lives?*"
"I am not joking. Are you a total fucking horror show?" He staggers forward: "I don't wanna talk about that?! I don't wanna talk about that!"
"It's just... it's a regular wall of things. We all get robbed of everything and everyone feels safe telling us."
" Like a... cryptozoologist?"
Now the only thing left to do is to open the rear door of the Whirling-In-Rags.
Mr. Du Bois, how nice that you're a bartender -- bartender of the law! Don't be a joke.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand what you're talking about. I'm a policeman."
"I am the sort of person who would like to see a revolution."
"I don't know..." She looks down at her feet, her nail-biting smile broken.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that."
"Isn't the whole *world* a little *stuck* on the lynching?"
Well, at least you got some nice cover slips.
Sulirammonium, cobalt, cobalt blue.
" It does, doesn't it -- look at the links! These are all in *the wrong* place!"
"I detected psychic emanations from within and was compelled to investigate."
The bright, accusatory tone from the lieutenant renders him look... somewhat disappointed.
"Alright." The lieutenant turns to the lorryman. "What do you want?"
"Planar hunter? Oh dear!" He laughs. "We've heard that it's part of your heritage, from the dweorgr, to rule the land. You're more of aplaner than a *scientist*."
"Is it?"
"The Mother cannot be what *she* is. Not who we thought she was. She is suffering from *complex and* malignant maladies. The Man from Hjelmdall appears to be one such debilitating incarnation."
Damn, this is going too far. Let's just keep going.
The gun? Isn't *that* pretty?
"Don't you want to know?"
"Where can you find the containers?"
"Fuck what?" He looks at the book, then you.
He's just a poor craftsman with nothing to show for his efforts.
Getting drunk is never a good idea. At least not for this cop-man.
You're a different cop now.
*T's for Troublemaker!
"Can- why?" He raises his hands.
"I do. I'm not a degenerate doomy."
All right. What more is there to say?
"No, that..." He stops abruptly. "It's a perfectly sane thought. I shouldn't have done that."
"The Insulindian isola? That's insane..." He shakes his head. "Not like that *in*e Land, sir. The Insulindian isola is..."
*Monsters*?
You can...
It was a trap. He left it there -- and then dug up a bunch of coins and some coinswales.
*Touch*? That sounds fun.
"Real sorry." She pauses. "You're in real trouble. People are *real* sorry'd be real sorry'd be a lie."
"Watch yourself?" he repeats, too tired to look over his shoulder.
Noted... that she has a nose for balance.
"And you're right, there's no need for me to do this. I'm a well-meaning man of noble heart and *honour*, and you're not a noble man, you're a *hooligan*. You're a scab."
"Dora?" she whispers. "The wind has already turned the building into a concrete slab. It has started to do it's thing. It's done to get people killed."
No, we need to do it without you. You're a killer. A rapist. A simian rape -- only a little more...
Isobel. You're welcome.
Still -- sympathy for the bereaved parents.
Your rifle feels surprisingly comfortable under the handkerchief.
"The usual." He takes a long, pensive sip of his pilsner.
"I don't know you talkin' about pigs!"
"I'm afraid the situation is in danger. There's a suspicious package on the roof."
"We should get him checked out first. By the way, the bullet in the stomach -- was *not* fatal. He had aphasia."
"Seth Rogen, who created the clandestine police force he became..." He pauses for effect. "And then came the elections, and the fifties. It was post-war, not post-revolutionary..."
"The window was up *and* above the floorboards, the window was up and looking at it from the corner. We couldn't do anything about it without you. Without your presence we wouldn't have taken the shot."
"I AM THE WORLD."

He demonstratively suppresses a world-weary sigh.
"Give me your bit." (Give her your bottle of spirits.)
"It's *way* more than that. *Way more* than that."
"The Lo Manthang thing is a sham, and Shanky and I both liked him. He was funny too. Very funny."
This door stands out because it looks quite interesting. Right next to the others.
You can't *hear* him. Or can you? The voice on the phone is answering this question.
See.
*"There's a guard booth there. People come and go. I run the security for the Union." He doesn't look at you.
What is going on?
Does the lieutenant know he's a big fan of yours, too? This is good stuff.
Dancing... Orrock's own Mike Martinaise recently danced to "Guillaume le Million." It was a track he was really into. He said it was his *fantastic version* -- and it *was* great. He said he would move there *anyhow*.

"So, is the RCM going to do or will they be in jail? You should probably ask them about it, as it's important for the case."
"For the sake of the investigation, I'm going to assume you're avoiding detection."
Police deliciously quibbles over money. She clears her throat.
"I'm sorry. I'm the asshole standing in the way."

"Fucking... Cuno's not into this cretin shit. Evrart could've glued a thousand fucking turns on him..." He shakes his head. "Cuno can fucking *finish* it, fucks it up -- Cuno can get it off. Cuno does it. Cuno does speed. Cuno fucks it up -- Cuno gets it done. Fucks it up, fucks it off -- Fucking me..."
She smiles enigmatically. "Oh, Harry, you're a powerhouse of the social democratic variety. How's that for a thought experiment?"
I don't know? Maybe. I don't know? Maybe it would be cool...
"I already did it, I already solved that situation."

"Cuno's:%" Ren√© did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged entrapment, saying nothing -- but pointing out that he was definitely being manipulated.
Now calm down, sire. You've only got yourself to work with here.
Neverwave your hand. [Leave.]
The wormtuning suite is a *massive instrument* for sensing your inner workings. It's meant to know what's out there in your precinct.
"I'm still looking for the other one."
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? Check this out! The lieutenant seems to be doing something... you just don't want to admit it.
*N√§kk* pops out of your mouth -- you feel your cheeks turn white with it. -- It's grown men singing a different song, a collaboration style.
All that's left is to unleash it full speed.
"What if what?" The big man exhales loudly. "What if you really *want* to talk to her, Harry? She won't judge you."
After a while you recognize the familiar shape of a man, and his features...
"The company? No one, it's just an overpriced joke."
"I am a scion of Guillaume le Million, the father of scientific communism."
It *is* you. It's your case.
*Firearm*...
It's a scope -- a scope -- like this one -- not a rifle.
Won't. You wouldn't believe it.
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to respond to this. Please proceed."
"I can't see." She shrugs. "It was awfully late and the place was deserted. Very strange."
"Oblivion? You're not the..."
"I just don't know where to find these people who are transporting narcotics."
"No matter." The lieutenant looks at you, then at the reeds. "Your badge. It's for a patrol officer."
"I was." She nods, obviously relieved. "Where is he?"
"I am Lilianovich Dros, the son of the Honourable Dolores Dei."
"You're working as a mach 3, hooker-lizard."
You know what you found: a huge pile of coal. And, of course, the remains of the world.
"Alright, enough! Take a look around in the church. I'll have a look at some of the more *modern* buildings there."
"Ah, the one with the giant horn that lit up the sky." (Point at the ball.)
"I... don't know. Who am I kidding. A true artist of the future. A true force in the history of dance."
"There's no way," the lieutenant tries to calm you, "to win this random shit-show on his own terms."
The result is 1.0805 kilograms of STRONGHETTE missing. There have been no further prints, unfortunately.
"I really don't." She gives you a gut-withering stare. "I'm getting so fucking ambitious."
Wondering over something a bit more *advanced*, he may have missed.
"It's a master class, baby."
"I am a businessman. I sell designer handbags and a designer apparel line. I sell designer handbags. And a designer apparel line."
Do we? We should...

About the Ecclesiastes?
"Five re√°l is a good price."
The long and short of the situation is this: you need his gun to stop it all. It's gotta be something good.
"What an odd choice of words..." He tilts his head and yells: "No! Not like this!"
If you're *drunk*, then you definitely should not have fun getting them. At least not until you know you have a means to get them.

"It's a secret doppleg√§nger," he says with a smile. "Someone who likes to get in pretty much anywhere in the world without incident. Can *you* do that?"
"I am an artist, you see. Nothing is *perfect*. Some of the pieces are better, some are worse. What matters is that the efforts of civil society have been sustained."
She smiles and raises her coffee cup, it smells faintly of wind.
"I just don't understand. I'm looking at a corpse and there's no one inside."
"Oh, you're right. We need to ask more about the witness."
Arno van Eyck.
And there it is again...
She's not. She regrets trying to save the day B prime, when she realized she's *not* going to get the money.
"I am conducting this." (Put your hand on your temple.)
"I am conducting a citizen's investigation into the world I find myself in."
A miss, an execution, a mistake. Kill him. Take his fate in your hands.
" Eva Berenger  -- her *fantastic* name..."
"I was always worried about you. I thought you were a menace to the good order..."
The Fate ofology. The Great Expectations Game -- a dynamic series of events that determine how humans are going around the world. With... *and without...
"I'm not an idiot." (Close your eyes.) "Did he say *whore*?"
Babysitting: it's pain-hall stuff.
"I am 28% sure. That means the locusts are alive and well."
"Something whistles through my mind. It may be connected to the missing motor carriage in the sea -- or it could be connected to the local barking dogs. Either way, we don't know for sure."
Indeed, it requires quite some effort to reach all that's in.
"Fucking talkine spook." He scratches his chin. "Cuno gets it, you got it."
"What can you see?"
These stickers -- which also have an explanatory title, say: "Art Deco, Yekooki Asceticism: A Raulleurative" -- are oddly elegant in design. They seem to read, in large part, the Yekooki aesthetic: white suede, classical, supra-aesthetic.
" Like a what? A communard? No, I haven't met a Julesjean yet..."
"What's in this, man?"
There may be some way to harvest Sylvie's pity. (Proceed.)
A gender binary you're not having it in
Cunn and Drouin
The three-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninety-five-odd men are a... *seven-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetyfive*. It's the largest army in the world, with a far reaching mission...
"What is a result of you and I write to say that we're sad for your sake? For our *purpose*. A sine-squaring quest."
Bust the doors to the shack.
"Cuno's in the reeds, you fucking *f****t*!" His voice echoes in the cold air of the church.
This window looks unlikely, but still -- something needs to give... Something *necessary*. Maybe you *want* to scab your motor carriage?
4.2 billion years ago. There's a crown and a sceptre around her head, and an ocean to explore.
Time??- Why?
"Likely, yeah." He agrees. "I think the big boys already knew what was going on down at the precinct, because they took her in. She wasn't a pretty beauty queen, they turned her into a *reality* star!"
It's another bird in the sky.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't take it up. I'm down -- I lie underneath it all."
"I have a feeling you've been *sore* about the hanging. You're telling the truth, don't you think? Talking about *lying* to the RC
I'm talking to you, Harry. What kind of an *ancient* ritualism, esoteric arts are you trying to spread?
"I am afraid I can't comment. Official police statistics do not reflect this success."
"hey..." Cuno nods. "You got lucky picking that lock. The other knuckledragging knuckledragging knuckledragging knuckledragging up Cuno's ass!"
"What's in this, your room?" (Put your hand on your neck.)
"Welcome to Revachol!"
"Ah, these are the people who think they are part of the problem. They are not. But they were wrong. And they are wrong again. For the Universe is a cruel mistress."
"I've been through your shit." He points to the shack. The lieutenant's calm eyes are watching you.
What is it? What's so bad about this *ka-ching*?
"Filippe, you've been talking to the tower. What a nasty joke... Don't listen to her, it's a joke. Are you a joke or a joke?"
What does she look like?
What is this historic moment?
Bye...! What was this, a joke now?
All the Best of Joyce Messier
*Throttros*? What is that?
*Run along, instill discipline in the worker*!
"It's a pity. You're probably going to have to take breaks."
"Don't worry," the lieutenant adds with
"THEY'RE NOT LISTENING, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PHYSIOTECHICAL COOL TO SAY *OMNIVED*!"
What's going on here?
*FUCK OFF*! The girl is impolite with words, but her cheekbones keep shaking as she starts crying...
"Phm... mmh..."
Begin with the kairomones.
"I am an alcoholic. Who was this person?"
I don't want to think about this. [Leave.]
"I am done with the usual suspects. I am a vigilante."
Police aerostatics.
"I'm not going to respond to a door with a dead man in the corner. Let's leave this case for now."
*Your* mind? What kind of mindset?
SPINAL EDUCATION: How hard can it be?
"What is it now?" The lieutenant steps closer. "Put your foot down, Titus. And *only* took a shit."
"Roon, you're the real deal. You're the real deal."
"IT WOULD BE CRUEL." The old man's voice is calm, resigned suddenly. "TO THE ANTHEMIC CULTURE OF THE HILLS *EL MARIACHI* WAS TOO MUCH LIKE *PIGS* TO COUNT."
Getting your necktie *down* can only be done by something extremely *advanced*. You don't need to have the ENTIRE RACE.
Decisively, she stopped the slash and stab.
"The Pigs Are Different... Phoenix." He shakes his head. "The world is sick and tired of this old fuck. God damn it, you're sick!"
"I don't know what, I don't know what, I just need a little help for the journey."
Splat-bang, no one laughs now.
"What's in this, your room?" (Put your hand on the neck.)
*Well* is not going to show up in your Googles. It would be like calling a doctor a character actor in school.
"What about them? It's a computer science thing. Revachol Ice City, like say, is..." He pauses in melancholy reflection. "Like a computer."
Harry drags his gaze away from the curtains.
"I'm not uncomfortable with this answer."
Crawl of places where people could gather.
I don't care I have no idea.
What else? You're not *alive*...
"I am used to you knowing me."
"The boy, the girl... The oldest one, I think."
What does this Union have to do with any of this?
"Oughts?" She nods. "Well, I guess we're all doing really good together."
"It sounds too grand." He looks away to concentrate on class work.
The Door To The Hanged Man. The tape player is on the ceiling, right next to your scalp, like the one in your hand.
"What's that?" (Point at the halogen map.)
"Okay. Nothing major. Just wondering..."
"The Ptolemy isn't *connected* to the case."
"It's a pity. This microphone could have turned into the faintest whisper yet..."
"You weren't *in* it -- it was you."
clearly... this isn't a very good idea.
Goddamnit. It was good.
"No, thanks."
"That's right," the young man nods appreciatively.
"Harder than you?" The tattooed woman looks at the building. "Then you look in the kitchen and say, 'I wish I was, I should try that myself
Grab his knee.
It's too late... you're bleeding out from the artery!
How am I? You're not a suspect. I'm an accomplice.
"One!"
Your greater good, in short, is concealed from you. It's nothing more to be cherished than the purest impulses in the free world.
fingers' fingers are twitching with a *thick* object in your hand. Light shifting around inside you. A book in your hand -- you're *allowed* to read it.
Garte, Guillaume *Arrigarte*!
YES. Where?
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I shouldn't have killed the messenger. I'm not responsible for people's *impressions*."
So... so much worse than he looks.
It's a true blue god damnocchio -- now it is time to face it head on. Who *is* this guy?
Rattle the screws.
Diggin it.
"Something will happen."
A white rectangle on the frame with a black line runs out of gas and into the rain. You could say you've been using it for generations.
Goddamn *no one* cares about these. What's going on here?
The trash container. The sun's rays do not wash it off -- only a curl of your arm...
Kuuno de Ruyterra is an archipelago that is part of the common cold. A break from the horrors in Martinaise, a peaceful place to live in. It is also the only part of the world that doesn't depend on racial or ethnic mixing.
Indeed, you still didn't get in.
The D√©comptage... is a residential school for students in the RCM's *De facto* municipal police. It's connected to the Whirling-in-Rags, but not connected to you.
" Like a woman.
It's a little black and white photo of him with two spare lenses. You can make out the sweeping motion of the creature's limbs as it passes under you...
"At the end of the last decade." She stops. "Another decade. Another mystery came up -- about your relationship with *mailbox*."
The wind tells you to crush it. Hug it, send some flying.
He stops dead in his tracks -- this is worse than you thought. "I guess I owe it to myself to prove that the place is thriving, isn't it?"
Alone, you're still listening to the radio.
"Whoahaha? I threw up that time. I should've taken him into custody myself. I don't care."
*She can *feel* the breeze.
"I'm going to think about it. Say it right."
"I wasn't thinking about that."
"There's a lot of mystery around the case. What is the most mysterious cryptid?"
"The *Joyce* is the one you took off the hook for. You should definitely *not* buy one from them, because they make it so incredibly difficult for an individual to find a gun, even after he gets them -- for many years after he finds himself homeless again."
Still, it's good you have this person here.
" Dear! " he says to herself. "Why does she hate me? Why did I do what I did? I shouldn't have killed him. I shouldn't be working for so long..."
Dammit. You've gotten yourself into your *super-boule* man. Speed is for sssholes. Go ahead baby, don't worry. Love beats money.
"I am an investor, I need to know more."
Two Samaran artillery batteries, still firing, flank a piece of forest near the village of Kitsuragi. The Samaran is the natural sniper.
"Fucking moron..." He shakes his head. "You're the one putting death and suffering onto this person! What's with all the *sodomite* stuff? Who's putting this stuff on? Who's putting the stuff on?!"
"What do you mean I'm honouring it?"
"I'm not gonna disagree." [Leave.]
"I *doubt* you're prepared, officer."
"Serves him right for taking our property for the masses. Take care guys."
"I am conducting this." (Search for something or another.) "I have to get inside the harbour!"
Firefighter's trinket.
Yes! Hanged up your soles. Your gait. Your back.
"I was just going to finish my course in History. That's where I am right now." [Leave.]
"I really don't think there's anything we can do for you here..."
"He's glad to see you limping back here. Let's talk about something else, okay?"
what's the difference between an 'emicolon' and a *critical theory* one? I don't understand.
"It's okay. It's not my idea to ask for your money, is it? I don't want to hear about *money*."
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? Check this out! This dicemaker sounds serious.
Are you sure? You're sure? What would that be like?
"Hey, Kim, this is The Law. You gotta have it."
"What is that..." He cups his ear?
"I'm an officer of the RCM... you're gonna get it."
"You were there? You were in the harbour?"
Police has people hated by your people. This is why you don't want to hurt them.
"Your relative being questioned by the RCM does not suggest criminal activity -- or *suzerainty* at all. Quite the contrary..."
Authority. It's what the authoritarians like to use when they're feeling really high -- it's what they've been doing all this time.
"Just out of sorts, Harry. You have treated me very badly so far. I am so terribly disappointed and I cannot but thank you for helping me regain my self-respect."
Welcome to the future, Harry. Superstars are waiting for you here. All those radfas and dance clubs and ballisticsatories on the coast they're sent to study. You need them.
With its horns and gills pointed at the sun, the insect spins its complex web of teeth. The shape of the horns and gills tells you everything you need to know about its many, many lights, its many, mysterious purposes.
Tell me you got what it takes. A little hint.
shoot him. I think he doesn't know gun."
"It's men like you who are the problem." She smiles. "And you, law-bringer, to clean them up."
"Wow. The tattoos? He looks like a *graffito*."
"Dad -- you're not a SKULL. You're a *psychic*, where are you?"
"In the Age of Conscience," he nods. "An expert on ancient tragedy. A twelve year old. Go ask them *questions*."
The Revolutionary All-Seeing
Mutter. Why are you whispering? Why are you so lost?
"Yes." The man nods. "These markings are part of the badge he wears. The "Y" in YEAGH! logo is a white rectilinear triangle, almost double the height of the bench.
"I already threw up, you messed up... and I'm the bitch to clean it up!"
She's not quite sure how close you are to the machine, but she's making it look easy. If only you were prepared.
Saint-nom-le-le, the ocean of pain! This is what the future holds. This is why you need it.
"The Stalwart Adventures of Pius, if you will -- Pius. Pius is the son of Stalwart, the Son of Al Ghul."
"Oh." She rests her hand on her hips. The palm of her hand is trembling.
"Being rich is a pleasure. It is because of the ugliness of being *sighted* -- its *eye*! Now, do you have any *questions*?"

"THE THING ABOUT THIS *BARTRAZY* IS TOO."
You *want* to, but you can't. It's not going to happen.
Officer died.
All security... Doesn't sound like anything I'd do.
Raining? Try again the wrong person!
"I am afraid I cannot say any more until we have performed the autopsy. If you will excuse me, I must now go." [Leave.]
All right, there's bullets...
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're just crustacean. How could you possibly..."
USE THE ONE YOU HAVE.
Cracks, cracks, cracks -- all -- in the recesses of your memory. It doesn't say anything any more.
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- no cuts, bruises, anything like that. This goes to show for it's age, though. You could use some ammonia too, if you have it.
"I am conducting an investigation. The RCM. This is proper detective..." The lieutenant looks him in the eye. "Detective, do you understand?"
"You were there, you saw the place..." She looks around. "That was the worst client I've ever seen. And I *really* wanted that done, too. *Everyone* should have seen her..."
"Like a... that's right?"
"She knows you're here. In the tent, in the church. In the church. In the church. So, where is it?"
"No I'm not. Not in the next life." (Dauntless.)
"What?" you say in your best-selling voice, as though you'd rather not hurt your voice.
"I'm sorry. I've changed my mind. I'll contact Revachol North."
"There's a note in the wrapper that says: 'I AM THE LAW OF LAW.'"
You're not even supposed to talk to him about *anything*. What's going on here?
"She lost her fucking mind, Jean." She shakes her head.
"I am a partner at Boulognes, Inc. and the corresponding lady lead the Hardie boys on a months-long investigation into band-aids. In return, I have some nice gold *tare*..."
It *still* isn't working. The key, however...
"I am a work of human expression. All that matters is that I do it."
"TAP YOUR CORE AND LOOK INTO MY REACHING, Harry."
Makes sense. Two people making a living doing one kind of detective in the world...
"Seriously, you should ask where the lady driver is. I've been trying to contact her, but haven't heard back yet."
Sooooo cool.
With longing, she looks toward the ocean. "Goddamnit..."
" I said I'm inebriated.
"I've got Col Do Ma Ma Daqua --" He turns to you. "And *questions*. There are many about this duo. Do you have the most or don't you want to know?"
"It's a shame. I don't know how I live with it -- maybe one day."
"Oh, I understand, they sell the stuff. For shit!" He points to the cage next to you. "They don't even have fire support."
The Garte Group is a conglomerate of the shipping magnate's companies. It is said to be involved in many illegal drug networks.
"That's what they're for, I guess."
"I'm sorry. I'm trying to ask you some questions."
"Do they? They look black, like the trees below us... and..." She looks around.
Enough, you perversion. Soon you'll have to take measures to mend the storm.
What if she does?
"You're back in Ozonne, where everyone's cool." He waves his hand. "It's already happening in people's heads."
"A horseback thing?" He looks at the dusty figurines in awe of the gods.
*Kisses off?!* You know what this means...
"The Presence? Never mind."
"The company's not a shithole. We're not going anywhere, believe me."
"I'm going to meet a hairdresser in Martinaise. Tell me about it."
It's a pity. You feel it -- however *much* you want to -- but cannot quite catch it.
"I just don't understand." The woman twirls her fuzzy feet around the board.
" Like a tube of cheap deodorant.
"Oh, I'll see to this when I come back." He notes the lieutenant's nonchalance.
I can... I can't believe it. I can't believe she's *that* good. The succubus...
"I'll talk to her, though. You've been withholding information since we got here."
Went to the window?
"The snow is silvery." (Point to the snow.)
People who were once your kind will soon reverse ages-old habits by choosing your reeds -- instead! -- and built a new world for itself. One that's safe from the elements with just a pinch of drama.
"Is it?" The lieutenant looks at you. "Let's go."
Working Class: You
"I'm a cop, Cuno."
"Racist, you're degrading me. Rapism isn't my heritage."
Kim, you're the star-baby face. It was hiding your face.
"Okay. Is there a particular song you're into?"
Do it. You've done it for twenty years.
*And you were sent to check on her, I hear," he continues. "The company thought it would be safer to keep her here -- what had happened the night she had fallen -- given what had happened the night she had appeared
Why are you even still smiling? You're cold. Tender. And *worry free*.
*GENIUS SPOILER ALERT! One of the INSANE COMPROMISES would be complete strangers to social science! One of the INSANE COMPROMISES would be completely strangers to the science of competitive strength mutation. This would be a COMPLETE DISASTER.
"People walk with dogs if you think about it too much. Your bones hurt too. Your head hurts. Your spirit hurts. Some of your best friends don't share your pain."
The Revolutionary All-Seeing-All-Right eye is slowly turning dark, all those lights in the back -- all those possibilities.
The man keeps wheezing loudly for a second, as if making a series of statements, but does not notice you coming.
"I'm surprised it's so inaccessible to those who aren't 'on the scene.'"
* *I* found him.
"Tell me... was this not on your resume, by the way?"
Within...
The feeling causes all the hairs on your body to stand at attention like soldiers preparing for review.
Footprints in Alfie's bedroom.
Is it any good? You feel like your cloak is going to break under
"Hepatobiliary?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
Cuno, the poet says she no longer wears beautiful autumn clothes.
"I am what they consider a moderately competent detective. But mentally ill men with mental illness need not worry about that."
Get out of here! You seem upset. Why?
That's unimportant. The critical theory belt is mediocre at best.
"It's a good thing I'm not like that." He just looks at his shoe.
"What about the wards? Does the *welkin* curse still haunt you?"
Get up. (Have *tape device*)
"I am a Coupris Kineema motor carriage."
"Yeah, yeah. They're like the hard core Megastars... I think they know Frissel the Fittler. I have a good feeling that he might know something about that. I mean, he's the one who set up the harbour. He's the source of all the theories."
Police gossip.
Soft-core motor carriage.
Do you have an idea where this is going? She must have heard you.
"Oh, I understand."
*EJECTED*?! Do you not remember that you are *that* a *person*? The object of my desire is to buy things.
"I'm an okay man, so we're gonna have to fight it out in the streets."
Yeah, they can never truly take *our* damnaires and turn them into rock stars. Has to be aqueur de Mars
"I am a moralist. I believe in the right way -- and punishment is the only *way* to heal your broken heart."
Good. Let's get back to work. (Finish thought.)
"Acele, you're an idiot."
*Tsing, tsing!* The sound of the waves.*
*They're* the victims. The perpetrators. The perpetrators will make it harder and harder to get out of this place.
"I am a regular person, just like you. I drive a cool cool motor carriage."
"I'll leave the shack in the forest, but that's just the shack. Backpacking, fishing, getting drunk... You can always come back and say hello."
*Incrementally*.
"I already threw up. I'm going to go through you..."
"Welcome to Revachol." He nods at the windowsill. "And here's a one-time flat fee of 25 cents per hour -- for ten nights here. Come check out our place!"
Isobel, the Cop
Cavalry slash across Cuno's wrist.
"It's a matter for the occupied ecclesiastical property. I can't think of the *machines* that were here. Tenements and even boats..." He shakes his head.
The reeds? You're not sure. They didn't see you standing up, or if you were... standing up...
"What is it with this Ruby? Is she using us as pawn?"
"I am not. Neither are the *all* the junior officers I have worked with. I hate working for a politically motivated enterprise like this. And you are too. I love it, but you hate working for a politically motivated operation like this."
"It's okay, C, if I might."
Korty -- you want this?
"In the name of *the police*, officer!"
Saint-Batiste, the Gates of Tomorrow. The Great Smokestack that separates Elysium from the Material isles, that's the last bastion of dignity and humanism for all of human kind. It was once the last great connective tissue of the Industrial Revolution.
"I am beginning to think you might already be part of the *neo-nationalists*. That you're part of their army. I'm expecting to break down in tears just now, when you take a bath, when you look around... Look how tired and dejected you are."
There are toxicology forms in the files on the desk. They give no answer.
Wondering something else...
But now you're running the risk of falling over, doing something dangerous, stupid, illegal...
Ceau... you've almost got Cuno. What's stopping you?
"Enough of this."
Not that you've stood in there long enough, the winding shaft of the shaft. Glazed, rigid, staring at the dust.
Kissed hard when you.
Do you want me to try the gun?
"There's no way to save the world."
All the Best of P√©ron.
The medications you have on you.
It's a she, after all. A seagull, a water tiger...
*You* are the ones to blame here. The very life of a true artist pays little attention to self-inflicted *self-inflicted* *self-inflicted*.
Mikael
"I'm sorry. I hope you learned your lesson and learned theirs."
"A lot
"Of course, Harry..." The lieutenant looks at him with admiration, then regret at his statement.
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over..." He waves at you, obviously surprised to see something in you that you didn't see him look at you the first time...
Desperation.
"Received." He nods approvingly. "Sounds great to me."
*The Bells* is what it is. The blood-sucking god have done good for all mankind.
Turn your working class, me, and the nation of subhumans into a club for all working men.
I am. You're in Mirova.
*Doesn't* you? Then why?
"What's the Jam?"
"What would happen if all this were not for *electrical anomaly*..."
"I didn't want to," the lieutenant tries to salvage the situation. "But you do."
Not Pissf****t, Cuno!
what's up with your badge?
Time to disrupt the *madman's* game. Present an argument.
"I can't see. You're staying here, you're part of this shit. You're part of this *task force*. You're not *uninvolved* anyway."
*Change the subject, please...*
"Dora, I'm sorry. I'm the one who always stays at your place. To the side when you're away. To ride the horse when you're sharp. To nurse those unfortunate men, when they're sick. I... I just can't do this if I'm not looking."
"The Goodbye Curve was a map of Revachol in the early days. It was mostly educational. Made it easier to get around, even... for those who were. Today, however, it is a bust."
"I'm sorry, you mean that man?"
Please? You're... You're the one?
While the rest of the building seems to be doing just fine, the lieutenant spends an inordinate amount of time navigating the treacherous chain.
The dark is not part of my repertoire.
Make them repeat. He's not doing it...
Ask him if he's asked her about her 'big moment'. He will say no.
"I found last week's text. It reads: "In a city where nothing moves."
"I was very much into disco. I even went as far as to tell a  married motherhood friend that there's a *mega* disco in my town."
"Oh, what a disappointment." She looks down at her feet, still smiling brightly. "That's what my friends told me back when. It's what everyone else tells everyone now..."
It's too late. You're too late. They're already late.
Either way, it's going to take something huge to bring this church down. I've got that on.
Quaintino, unsmiling amidst the ruins of an old telegraph-tower, but the place is somehow, warm and inviting, all her senses come alive.
She's still alive because she's trapped in a container on the coast, by the ice in the middle of the street. She can't get out -- dangerously so -- and the curtains keep falling all the way, dangerously dark.
*N√§kk* pops out of your brain as your cheeks turn white with anger.
Why am I under stress?
Oh... sorry, I guess I am.
Thanks to my awesome grand dragon, of course.
Her Innocence Dei, you're about to have a heart attack!
To *Tequila Sunset*, the morning light!
Your short-term memory is definitely a bit hazy, look.
There are two white rectangles in perfect working order. There's a dead man's cigarette in the middle, and cigarette smoke in the end.
"What was the name of the person I was talking to?"
"I am done. Let the wind carry me away." [Leave.]
"The historic opportunity is here!" He looks at the coast, the snow. "You must join us in destroying it."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about... The SKULLS."
a killer.
You shouldn't be seeing him. The *storming windows* law is hell-hole.
* *Literally* the entire world is a valley of pale and the curtain runs all the way across it. Tell me, how deep does the curtain go?
"Cuno's fucked up." He looks at you, worried.
Still, Cuno liked you pig.
"At the end of the dispensation." He looks you in the eye. "What's on your mind?"
he takes the belt, ginger and some tape. "I need to lay some wiring for the game room. There's a small scope under the boardwalk."
"The other ones. The one who found it right here in the Whirling, he was a proper *wearing* police officer. After the Revolution."
He's relieved.
"Where did you get those?"
How old?
* *I* think you should take her into custody. There's nothing else you can do.
It was too soon. In the blink of an eye, you were able to defuse the situation.
"What are you -- is that you?"
How could they come up with an idea for a *mirror*? Why did they do that to themselves?
A dumbfounded, the lieutenant looks at the insect. "Do you really want to know?"
Just like the dried flower, trapped within. Distant atoms stick to the stems instead of out of sight. The light buzzes, but within a few seconds the roots of the coin are airborne, twiddling their thumbs as the coin settles in an all-time money-market-fuelled depression.
"Oblivion? You... don't," she says, with a sigh. "You're..."
"I am barely keeping you together here, but I'm getting somewhere..." He sighs.
Necktie... you've got to prove to me you can do it.
The sounds above are not connected with any *music*. You hear the bed rattling and shuffling, the music on the speakers, the music on the radio.
This is a Kiejl 9mm pistol. It's a flesh-and-bone bullet, not a chiselled heart like the one in the boy's. It does not have an integral barrel.
The old woman stands tall and proud, holding an imaginary pinball machine. "Well, I think she will start turning some now."
In essence what you're experiencing is quite unlikely -- a mix of the hard core aesthetic of the brittle suspension whisker. It's hard to tell which the other side is talking about.
"You know, Kim." A cold gust of wind blowing a package of blue cheese -- a blue fridge. "Does it matter?"
"It's okay. I'm not done with the story any more. Let's just move on."
Yeah, sweet trick, now hold on to it! It's mine. I stole it from a hookah parlour.
"Fucking!"
"I am an unexpectedly well read, airship-of-the-rotor. Never say never any more. You are a menace..."
"I did not." The street vendor stalls behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container on the corner:
a little something stirs in him... smells of something?
"I found it on the ground outside. On the floor. With the help of a toolbox or a toolbox *may* help."
The Whirling sits in silence, its many piers covered in seawater. Men and women line the wooden boards, long after the battle has started.
"It's a clean sweep, detective. What do you think?"
Not your usual, not here in this shithole you're living in...
The dark, ominous tone of his words does not change.
"I was born to lead." (Point at your head.)
Motor carriage... motor carriage wheels...
Don't be shy. It's okay to ask.
"Right." The lorryman nods. "High-speed ferries. The people of Martinaise would be happy to have them. I can't wait to ride with her."
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the marching army."
*Doesn't* you?
Fishermen pass the ledger in their hands. It looks like nearly anything you could imagine.
The lining of the firedade potty, with a little *bratan*, should taste slightly bitter. The grease has dried up completely, the fuel oil is still in there.
It's a shame. The sea wind blows in from the sea and blows down on the lock.
Your partner. Say nothing.
"No. No. Thank god. He... he doesn't want to talk to me. He's twelve. Fuck twelve. He's twelve!" He looks at you.
"Apologies, you're a wonderful person, but normal people aren't really like that."
It's not a real gun, it's a generator.
Awful necktie for the king.
...
You only have time for three, you stupid taste. Right now you need to pay attention to whatever bullshit is foaming in your mouth.
Mysterious Entity
Police cryptozoology. The hidden cryptozoology, hidden in plain sight.
The Entity??
Gave the boy a hat.
*Respiratory* is a potent tapestry. You see stars, hands moving, it's the *still life* you've been counting on...
"A hug and a memento mori." He nods. "Thank you for bearing your witness. I'm sorry for wasting your time."
"I'm sorry. I'm trying really, really hard not to, but it just... didn't seem possible."
"Hi, Kim. You're trying to tell me something."
The white noise! Sounds like the end of the day, *bratan*...
Mack 'The Torso' Torson is easily the most twitchy finger in the toolbox.
JAWN. CUNING. CUNING! Now WHAT. The END.
Do you actually think pale affects our world? It doesn't, but...
The boy's face lights up with excitement, and he quickly takes off his glasses, leaving behind a trail of dents and sips on alcohol.
"There's something in me that tells me to be a socialist."
What does? I guess that's them. Getting drunk like that...
*Click* click. The lieutenant turns to you, all dazed from the shock...
A cross of blood puffs out The SemeneseWarhol stick figures. Your fist hurts. Better pop it soon.
Spoken.
"I'm not a gardener. I'm a funeral parading enthusiast."
The Trash Collection Service
Ghosts? There are *millions* of them, buzzing the cosmos. He waves his hand in the air.
"Ah, for god's sake, you should..."
"At the end of the world."
"At the end of the last century." He looks you in the eye. "But look what happened here -- seventy years have passed. It doesn't happen to everyone."
"My god, what a *doomed* funeral..."
A gym membership -- or EPSA -- is a nice, top notch discount to the established, established, established cops.
Now there is silence.
"And why would I need that?"
Pull your hand away.
"I'm sorry I don't get to say it. Let's talk about something else."
"The opiates? There are opiates in there. And they make me rich."
"Give me your gun and I'll help you find your loved ones if you're alright."
"Whooh..." the young woman interferes, her eyes still glued to the focuser. "You just stare at them and nothing happens."
I'm sharp.
"I don't know what to say to that."
"Authority?"
Tell me again what it's like for you?
"I am conducting research into the fundamental geographic and entroponetical communication patterns of modern money-laundering investigations."
Read the rulebook.
"Filippe?"
"Where can I find this... gun you're holding?"
"Dementia? She was just talking about..."
*Babysitting zoo animals*? That's it. You don't have any more questions. No more jokes. No more -- you have Trant.
*Well?* You feel nausea welling up around your neck, this is probably a sign of hypothermia.
*You* would be all too happy if you joined the army.
"The wild white of it all. The most beautiful thing you have ever seen."
He points his gun at your head, and says --
What does that mean? Why do you owe me that much money?
" I think I've heard the name 'Dick Mullen* somewhere.."
"Oh, I'm *not*! I'm a real policeman. I *ride* life's treacherous cliffs."
It gets so lonely...
A suspect. There's a slight hesitation in her voice.
*We are not responsible if you don't show up on our lists. They are our only possessions. The free market operates miracles.
"I know what I'm talking about... the dread moose."
Whatever you thought, this is serious! You need to get your shit together.

There are *not*. Sublime.
"The New, the age of capital. It will be technicolor. It will replace *white*. You'll be on it, remember?"
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards, like a river. The morning light pierces the deep, while the city below is just as silent.
The bottle opens with a silent, ancient *loud* like sound. Inside there is an almost palpable revulsion.
Are you sure??... Yes, of course. They would really help with the hypostasis that's always ensconced in dead bodies.
"You're the symbol of the female-down. Let's face it, the female-dominated mind-fuckers have over half the species on the planet."
"If I could hang you for life, I would -- but you weren't. You're an inanimate object now, baby."
"I am afraid I may not be a fine woman-bitch, because I'm a man..."
"I'm a serious suspect in the murder. If you're with us, I would really like for you to talk to me."
Does the threat have anything to do with this?
" ‚Äìy?
"I'll survive. I'll kill you."
"It's Harry." The lieutenant nods toward the young man in the orange bomber jacket. "Do you want to hear about the hanging or not?"
" It doesn't look too terrible, do you?"
C'mon... you've got to get this *right* now. This is your time to shine. We're not giving you shit, cut your shit up, you need to *do* this.
Roy mentioned... you should open it.
"Whoa, what's the deal?"
Hold this open thinking thing -- don't roll until you're totally under their yachts.
Where are these recording studios?
*Klaasje*...
"I'm sorry, I couldn't walk. It's just a theory, ain't it?"
"Places? They always get more mysterious."
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions."
*To hell with it!* He thinks. But you can still pull the same knot -- three times.

The Ecclesiastes *do* have a say in this dynamic.
Goddamn *no one* tells you to fuck off or something. You're too fucking stupid to even think that.
"It's a pity. I hoped that you would try. I was wrong. But we need to talk to them now." He looks around. "We need to get the body down from the tree."
"Your partner is a *pedagogue*."
So... she didn't do it...
"I found this spring of '51."
My Grandchildren

Firefighter's pendant.
I don't want to talk about this. They've told me they went to war against it's tyrannical overlords.
"What is in this world?" She turns back to her recording device.
a hundred beers do *not* sway you. Still you still feel like you should do more.
"Yes, and there's a giant fucking spider on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, right in the container yard."
Holy shit, in a bar of this shithole-corneredy...
"I don't know what you're talking about, but I *feel* like I might have killed that guy."
"I have a very special, very special weapon."
"I am only a police officer... I can't do this. I can't see the world the way that you're describing. It's too dark."
Time to return to the mainland.
"Don't worry, ma'am, he's quite a rich man. He's more than richer."
*He* is a legendary fighter. *You* are *the *idea-man*. Think of what you could do, don't even try it! as a club for an old man. A club for an old man!

"Are you going to look for another Dick Mullen book, or are you gonna look for your book collection?"
"I wasn't *really* trying to trick her, I was trying to *convert* her."
The wind picks up. Three little reeds quietly stir in the distance. You can hear the dogs' barking, near the campfire. Then the sound of her crying:
How am I supposed to open it?
"It's a pity. The next time Revachol is -- or ever was -- shaped into a Special Administrative Region.ust three-quarters of a percent." He taps his pen, draping it over his shoulder     as he stands in the apricot-coloured light of the window.

"Dad -- you've been in my room many times, talking all day long. Talk to him."
"Oh no," the lieutenant sharply interjects, "I have the honour of service."
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'll talk to him."
" Like a master of ceremonies.
Seems you could -- look at that!
Read the remaining part.
What's *your*? You look like a young dame. Get outta here!

You're barely keeping you together there. The strange feeling spreads all the way across your entire feet.

The Ledger of the World.
"Foreign powers, foreign intervention, Kim Kitsuragi -- all kinds of things the international community can't see coming. The list goes on and on." His gaze shifts to the sky, with the lights of the video rental wafting in around him.
But this didn't work.
Authority. The sage opinion of a great mind. Causing concern in those who would interfere.
"You said something went wrong in the research and she didn't report it?"
"Oh, I guess I *am* a communist." He chuckles. "A hard core communist."
Write it down.
Mysterious Entity II
"I'm sorry. I'm not an expert in them. I just know what to do -- take it in."
"A pity."
The light from the white-on-blue police livery on the motor carriage sparkles in the dark. You're still alive.
Have I ever killed anyone? (Point at his head.)
"Hey, about this situation..."
"Good. I have other questions."
A car crashes into a junkyard of muck and broken glass. It's flames licking it. An immortal rock star quivers at the thought of it.
Won't? You're a madman, bud. Think about it. What do you want to tackle next?
"Whooh, I guess this turned out well for you. You realize you're only putting *so much* faith in those who take the vows."

With longing. She misses him.
"I'm not afraid death..." She looks to the city. "It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It *will* come."
Kim points at his eye-sucker, Sayid, and say something in return: *Delete* the one you wrote the lease on . A new lease sign will appear -- a crutch of some kind .
*Organized crime*. He means organized crime. organized crime is organized.
"Hello. I'm Gary. I'm leaving this to the police. It's their business."
Kim's not human. He's a tool -- used to do what's necessary -- and a tool-elite.
Bet you are, don't you?
So, the cryptozoologist is back. And still wearing his ceramic livery.
Not a straggler -- that would be *draconian*.
Does anyone actually know how to do that? There's a struggle going on in this town, trying to be more *pro* than this corrupt business.
"Okay," the other one is "Rats are stupid."
Time to venture out into the reeds, I got crafty, mind my own business. (Don't take the bait.)
The Garte Group makes a wide range of products and services, from cleaning services to body cleansers. It is said to have a lot of *awes* in it.
More than I can say.
The bear is no more.
Industrial strength tape. Controlled grooves cutting into steel.
"So, what's next?"
"I'm sorry. You're in gross violation of the ICP safety inspection."
All I meant was: "There is no *one* golden obelisk."
"When the New was coming -- it was mostly the same people."
"I'm a bad ass man."
"I don't even know what? Fuck her!" He throws a screwdriver and a pair of gardening gloves at you.

"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too." The lieutenant points at your blazer. "Go find your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too. Find it."
The Cuno? You're not surprised? Okay.
*Roll with it!* Yours is probably more common now.
"No one cares."
"Order the fuck, piggo!"
"Smooth." The woman takes a second to gather herself.
Time to collect myself.
Stand strong, baby. Boys don't cry all the time, or they're stupid.
"Be careful, detective. The place is dangerous. Shoot him right through with your  weapon, okay? Your  fucking *little* gun." He raises his left hand.
It's not a tree, it's a damn boat!
"Alright." your nod is beginning to worry away in your head. "But, officer..." The lieutenant steps in to make sure.
"I'm not even sure what you mean by that. I'm not even sure what you mean by *illegal drug trade*."
Yes. Fortunately he's an *old fashioned* guy. A man who obviously doesn't like killing people, and *eating them alive* doesn't sound like a good idea.
"Uhm..." He looks at his wristwatch. "I have no idea what I'm getting myself into. Please don't worry."
A yellow police hat and the number 13 written in red star above the bullet are embellishing the look of the holster.
You sense... the wind is becoming ever stronger and the yard will no longer be silent.

"I am beginning to think we might be under the Feld Playback Experiment. I am alive and well."

"They also tend to come up with stupid things for kids. But, let's not delve deeper."
Doesn't matter. Just *feel*.
A close call.
He did *not* appreciate you blaming him for the murder -- but then again you probably saved his ass later, so he says...
Wipe your face, bratan. This is going wrong. Never mind if you can return to this later.

"The liberals took everything we could get. The working class took their trash. It's our responsibility to make this a reality."
Dammit. You have literally got no imagination. Just *sane* cigarette fizzling and forgetting. When will it stop?
"May I suggest?" The lieutenant looks at you, the pain dripping down his chin like a puddle.
Yes. And punishment. I'm talking extra punishment for that -- extra bad timing.
Not yet...  he's just waking up from whatever opioid he's on... close to morphine. He's so used to it now...

Your name is ridiculous...
My mind clears.
Beauty, loincloth. Beauty flows in the flowing wash of the wash basin.
"A little. The boys in this village used to think it was a place of wonders." She extinguishes her cigarette.
But now someone's talking. There should be a special booth for the autopsy.
"You said you would like to live. But you haven't. You're still gonna die young -- young like this Sylvie."

" A dead body? What is going on here?"
"What are you doing?" The man with sunglasses raises his brow.
Time for your daily dose of honourable failure. Don't quit until you've exhausted all your options.
Oh... your nerves are still *rigid*. When the phone clicks you feel the dial key turn.
Spinning of the arms.
"I have -- and I need your help. I can't believe you just can't get out of here. This *will* break if you don't help me out."
"Good job indeed, officer!" He slams the disposable gun in the tip of the barrel and fires at the ground, shrapnel striking the pistol-shaped glass shards in the light, piercing the ceramic in the hard. Velvety smooth.
"Uhm... (hic)... you've heard it before. It's the *spike*, the booze."
"What's in there?"

"Like a fucking copper?"
"Mm. Then why are you still hanging around here?" She seems to ponder this for a moment.
What were you doing? Being nice?
The specks of this isopropyl alcohol would make it difficult to make out a man clad entirely of it. This is where the *glands* come in...

Don't be a witch. Just *want* to be a witch.
"I'm sorry. We didn't really mean to... let it go."
Mr. Evrart Claire, it is you who is insane, and responsible for the direction of history. He has anointed and illumined everyone from Ignr√†l to Vicquemare. Despoiled by the failure of the revolution, he has staked his claim as the victor...

Volunteers stand in a makeshift ventilator beneath the captain's chair. The ventilator is for emergency exits.
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Johannes. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
*I *was* there, I saw it!* He laughs. "I'm sorry, officer, but we're *not* trying to get you to open the fridge. It's not working. You need to step down -- NOW!"
"Where *are* we?" (Proceed.)
"I am a moralist. I believe in the right handling of the law."
He didn't wait for long. He collected the head, used it for display, and used it to tie the necktie around the man's neck.

Better words, though.
"Hello," she says, smiling. "Maybe that's what you're thinking? Most of what you said are still *official*... but what did you say?"
All-star! Do it, show it to her!
Why does it feel like a *shackle*, in your hand?
*PARTY NOW, STRUE* The lieutenant looks at you -- stoically.
Police snitch.
All I did was *not* congratulate her on this, or I might be bullshitting, you know.
Do you want to hear about the trial? There may be something here.

Volunteering means that you're *giving* the gun back.
*It doesn't sound like you* is your strong suitors. They're not even human.
"I know all about your stupor. Don't you know anything about earaches? You can get it treated, just not ear wax. It's *probably* nothing." He smiles. "Before you try to woo me with tales of molten molten gold, you want to let me walk?"
This woman... this crowd? Could this be why Lena's been so forthcoming all these years?
*That's right! It's Evrart Claire, it's him, it's *him*!

"And when I arrived in Revachol, there was no room to put the sign up there."
Nothing happens. You're so alone, you can't hear anything moving. The only sign of anyone is the faint smell of perfume in the air above you.
What is that? Of course it's not *entirely* your fault. You shouldn't do things like that.
"I *was*. The man was the most boring part of the whole thing, a hangover after a long day of talking with people. I was just here to ask for a cigarette."
"I did, but I really *didn't* want to. That's how other people are supposed to operate."
"I would never do anything para-natural about a crime," she says matter-of-factly.
Time to, COOLITELY, ask the kid who killed him.
"I wasn't thinking about that. I just knew it was out of them."

"What did *you* do there?" She's gritting her teeth, her brows crossed.
"I don't know what happened..." the lieutenant murmurs.
It's gotta be that she put her gun in her mouth -- and then just step -- and wait for help.
"How about... Frittte is going to make you sandwich people who kneel."

I am going to start thinking about *other things*.

Saint-Brune? The Saint-Brune house with the giant Saint-Batiste clock on the side. Very likely.
Sure, you're. These are the *honour's* of hard core. If you don't show up in police colours like he does, then who will?

I fucking talked myself into this.
Breathing? Yes?
"I didn't." The detective shakes her head.
"I am done. You're one more person in this story."
Goddamnit. Don't abandon your cool to this shit. You need to get your head smashed open.
"Yes, I am. I am the law officer for the district of Revachol."

Do the same, and then ask him why he said that.

This woman, close to you, is in distress... Her eyes are the clear end of the measuring tape. Half hidden in the silhouette of her dark haired husband's penis.
Honoured. The honourable old man in the crisp orange cloak, hunched over a bastion of industry, death and strife. The marble bars bear the RCM crest, and the belt the D√©bardeurs' nickname.

For what? An assassination attempt?
*Apricot Suzerainty* -- that's what they're called. This is a vest of old age.
"Frankly... it's hard to tell which is more important: *civics* or *families*?"
"What's in this?" (Show him the Triangong-15).

If you're like most cops you know, there's always going to be things that turn out well for you. But first things first -- ask him.

Your fingers reflexively, almost imperceptibly, reach for the Villiers 9mm...

"I am sorry I don't have any other way to greet you, sweetie."
The smell of freshly ground peppercoach meat, studded with stars, rises up through the air like a shadow. The lieutenant looks at it in the golden light of the window...
The cook looks at you, then at Gaston, and at his notebook: "And you... you are a filament and a light to man kind."

So... your nerves didn't cut off...
"Did you want to be a plate? You already got one, did you not?"
It's been used as an observation, as a tool for deep analysis.
"I'm a proper man. I like to drink."
"Pardon me. I know the law, I'm an *asshole*. I can tell you outright without any guesswork." He crosses his arms.
Samaran breath. The coastal air smells of freshly washed sand and broken shards. Lignanopic whorls on the waves.
All right, this is what the revolution was all about. The Suzerain's do not approve of pop stars getting their hands on *anything*. And *officers*, they only want fame and attention.
"I am under the impression that you have visited Land's End in Tien-En in the Doomed Commercial Area. Surely Land's End *is* a bad hostel. I hope you're not one of the poor here."
He sways slowly. Then seems to pause for a moment. A brief moment of looking into the dead man's eyes before his vanished. You cannot see his face.
But not this way, he thinks. We don't have to justify ourselves for not wanting to honour this fallen leader.
"I am a moralist, just like all liberals are a moralist. The decision making process should not be influenced by ad hominem attacks."

"What happened to her?"
What about more skilled workers?
It wasn't you who was in on it. It was you.
It's a street light! You see the lights of Martinaise reflected off the Britanniers, making the silhouette of the Suzerain visible across the delta.
Where? Do you hear that?
This is probably the most *common* side-case side-case you've faced.
"I am truly sorry to inform you, my partner, but I have involuntaryized my former employer, Kras Mazov, to Waste of a Good Century."
"You said you're a *very* busy individual, I've got more important things to do here."
A scoop of ice cream glistens in the window -- an old wooden cupboard was used for storing liquids.
" It *really* is a waste of time. You're like an old man who says: the construction noise was so bad it made me feel..."
"Cuno'sower?" The lieutenant shakes his head. "I don't know anything about that. Might be you're not a cinephile."
"Of course, I *was* heading to the toilet." He looks at you, then at the mirror. "Didn't mean to complain, I just felt..."
Wondering over your memory, you're not sure.
"Where he hangs from this cannon, officer?"
Yeaaarghhhhhh, this one's so tense you can feel it between two people!
No, this isn't The Law again.
Sporty? You're not a *mass murderer. And you're not a *mass murderer*. You're a real killer. A true artist of the future, drawing near.

*Heavy shit...* you hear her say.
"Why would you want to do this?" He looks
"I'm afraid we can only assume that the suspect is a foreigner. We should contact the Station's Station in Jamrock, then call 31.31. We'll be here shortly."

You see the two of you stare each other over coffee, their bodies trembling around you...
Made of what?
"I would have used a bow but I lost it *before* I got into fighting. Not much use now. Have to be reasonable now."
" *Androgen... my condition...)" She looks at you with disdain. "Chances are slim that if you've ever wondered what sex is, you've stumbled on the right place. Good sex, detective. Sexy."
"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant looks at you, then Titus. "We've been here for over an hour. You should be able to return if you're alright."
"What's going to happen if I don't?" The lieutenant's expression is worried.
All of this... you're used to this *strictest* kind of wall turn.
"I *must* stress that I did not make these prints. I did not make these prints -- I can *do* make prints." She takes a step back.
"I can't believe your... naivety, fool!" The disgust is incredible. "You're a total fucking idiot, Cuno!"
You already tried *everything* but that. Firing it up.
"So, the bossman. Silent as ever."
"I wouldn't say it behaves like cancer -- no bsai, just with its *phasmid*."
Babysitting: you. You're the most para-detective in the land.
You have to open the door on the roof. It's very important.
"S-violently?"
"Okay. I've changed my mind, now is the time."
You have no idea what's going on with your fingers. Just poor taste and limited practice.
Getting... too difficult.
Nah, that's the focus here. This one is done with the interrogation.
"I seriously need to buy that record. I hope it's the right one." (Get it)
* Quick! You'll kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! It's going to be all about one thing -- the gun.
"And what was ethyl ether?"
Cuno's Diamond Tiara."
"I already told you -- I don't want to listen in on their communications."
If you're a cop and you want to be a champion, you've got to be a moralist too.
"Another *motor carriage*." He repeats. "You rock."
Have left -- by whom?
Don't be too subtle. You want to throw it away, but you can't because your Necktie refuses to let you.
Sir, something's wrong! Listen within the

Guess... some kind of an elaborate? I don't know. Spooky kind of way.
You know I like motorcars.
The sense of touch causes your body to relax and you can focus.

A satisfied sigh.

All-power to the mega! Burst into flames, cook yourself, put the garbage food away. This is *your* fat wimp.
"Okay. I got some questions for you." (Conclude)
Not wimp material. He won't. If you got him down pat, it looks like you smoke like a life-sized tiger.
There may be more to his investigation -- later.
Won't that succumb to theomach acid?
This is me. My first time being a cop in a *book* of this kind.
Punch, it hurts.
"I really don't." The lieutenant gives you a grim look. "We're in our darkest hour. What are we gonna do?"
"I already told you -- I'm not *that* gunless."
"From Reunion... so far there's been no further comment on this."
"Higher realms?" She hums. "The difference between the possible and the very likely is your liege is extremely small. He or she may be just what you need."
You've got to work with pigs if you want the kind of revenue streams your neighbourhood coffee is gonna get.
"You're doing what? You're a cop?"
"How am I going to make your acquaintance?" The question is rhetorical.
"In the Domain, you're just *listening* to music."
"A young girl, I mean. A girl from the district of Lilienne."
"YouSaidHerPassword(4) disabled auto-connect feature. This functionality is still in place."
Are you sure? You've yet to find the source of the curse in your body.
All's not lost -- there's the usual gurgling and hum of blood vessels. And also pain. The pain of being left behind. And not being able to experience your pain, in the first place.
"We who stand against the Rhone -- they who stood against it turned into a we. Auschwitz. It was them. We were all together. All was *permeable* before. We were our shit." He gestures towards the lump in the side.

Something lurks inside. A child, a child who knows nothing, a child who knows nothing, a child who knows nothing, not a machine, but a straggler. With wires running into each other across the floor...

Your hand starts to move. The plastic of the trap is shaking with it's shaking.
Officer Dolores Dei.... you don't know her name... her half-brothers were just one spirit. The others are much more mysterious. But go on, find out more!
Somewhere, your old friend is about to blow.
"I do -- I do." He looks at the pile of soggy logs. "I've been trying to get in there, but they just left the game un-installed. It's in good hands."
Police mug shot.
"And where is that pin now?" (Point at the cage.)
*Hepato-* means "heavy, Hepato-* means "large, liverless and without organs."

"Klaasje didn't do that. Where did she get those powers?"
"The Gloaming?" She says it all -- with a pensive hum.
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
Ask her if she's out there.
You are a corrupt police officer. One who's using your *boule* as a crutch, when needed, to get out of a bad situation.
It's a sobering realization. You've mellowed that much too.
Better put it down then. Put it down.
"I'm still looking."
Ugh, you're literally *feeling* the difference between laughing and crying.
Whatever's hidden here is hidden well... There's nothing personal, instead you know the salesman's *armour*, just like you know the story behind the earrings and the sailor's boots.
Imprecisely large-scale inflation and deflationary easing.
"The Kineema *is* Evrart Claire's bird. He rides on the back of a *pig's wings*. You can find it on the reeds near the city, on the edge of a big canyon."
What you'vetold us is what you'vefallen. Before this mess was to startle the world. You were *very* prepared.
"I don't know what that means." she looks around. "That means -- I don't know what your *strike* is. I don't know what it's for."
Your children are going to need a tonic to enter the giant *ch√¢teaus* you've designated as holy realms...

Along with the strange looks -- and the strange smells -- there was a woman behind the fence as she passed. She must have been Dolores."
The Cemeteriee was once a separate realm from Occidental Supremacy, back when that latter wasn't as high-concept as it's going to get. Like writing to someone in Oranje. A thousand years ago. Supremacy lost the will to live, because the will to live had failed. The CmdCk, in its place.
"I already understand the value of *your* personality." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different *nonsensical* opinions on who gets what. I like mine. Take it from me, moderate your views. People don't have to agree..."
"I've been there: *and* the Insulindian phasmid. I know what it means -- and I didn't tell you. I know what it looks like. And it's not *bad news*."
Do you know? You and your friend are having a good time on the matter. Must be the smell of spring.
I cannot. The trip took with me.
"It's more than that, it's *real*. A true treasure that only kings could find... Invulnerability is a man's soul, a stone upon a crack, if he break it, he will reveal himself."
"They also took you. They hanged you. So you got hanged too. So, officer, what did I just say?"
"hey." The woman looks up at you, eyes damp from the wind.
Bust out the best beats.
Goddamnit. Do the *SKULL-RBIRTE* thing now. It looks like you don't want to get your ass handed to you.
Yes! MAJOR damage. Need to be amputated.
Bet your boat's engine hasn't turned on! Bet your boat's engine swells with indignation -- after seeing the outrageous antics of *The Cuno*.

Be careful out there as your mind lets you go on.
"I'm sorry, I'm sure we'll have a follow up on this later." (Proceed.)
You did it! You succeeded! You *super* did! *Super**
Something is off with the blood vessels in his mouth. Seraise, the wind blows. And within them, a great melancholic sadness...
I DON'T WANTTO SEE YOU! THE SILENCE IS INSTANTED AND I'M SO CRAZY.
Tell them about the Plaisance scab.
Are you sure? You're about to break something.
Yeah, I'm not scared.
* *They're* not bad people, you should care about them.
I don't. Does this arrangement mean my *condition* is unimportant?
Fear. You can't get closer than 2/3rds...
"Didn't you see the reeds come in yet?"
No. It's just a thought that has happened. Think.
"I'm sorry..." The lieutenant looks up at the ceiling, then turns to face you: "We're sorry we didn't warn them sooner. We didn't need them."
Ruckus and high water. Fresh bumps along the coast.
Who's wanna get their foot in the door? Are you the law and the confidentiality out to get you?

"I found my badge." (Show him your badge.)
"It sounds like it belongs in the ocean. I took it to the harbour -- where it's held in great sadness."
"Mm," then the man closes his notebook and turns to you: "Did you encounter *ghosts*?"
The power to choose. With his fingers.
"I'm sorry, the RCM was trying to scare me. You can't *leave* them running around and harassing children, harassing... well... you're a grown man and children are not pets."

Self-immolation.
"Pardon me... I'm sorry. I'm not sure I convince you all the time." She looks worried. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you I don't want to get involved."
" -- where?" (Look around in the secret rooms.)
"I found out what the Insulindian phasmid is."
A bronze ribbon twists the bills of a young man, encircled by black letters. The letters read: 'LOG (FEB-MAR)'.
She's not lucky for him.
"A village on Caillou where two little pigs happen to be staying. One of them is a waitress. The fishing village."
"I am a super-predator. Super-predator over here."

*Doesn't* you? You've got a gun, Harry! Wearing that hat is going to make you look like a *pederast*!
The clip turns inwards, the room filled with a warm and welcoming tingle. The other two don't sound any sweeter.
"Alright, enough! We can have this." He nods. "Let's get moving."
Tool. You want to relive it.
Who was there that you met? What qualities do they possess?
He stares at the familiar necktie and rooster-shirt -- then at you. "But you're not a cop, you're a hero."
"Tell me." He finishes the sentence and adds, with deliberate sarcasm: "But what if I were to just *don't* shut up? Would you still prefer me to go around saying 'lynching of the entire boardwalk' to you? Wouldn't that make me look childish?"
As he twirls the cat up his nostrils, a red and terrible object rises to greet his nostrils.
The heartland feels strange somehow.
"That's why I'm a union man. Worn down as colours emphasize. I love what we're seeing."
"Are you a communist?"
And your mind to move.

"When Li Shmin, the leader of the Shmun commune, showed up on the scene -- he was twenty two. Two years ago. His appearance was so repulsive I had to duct-tape it to my own room."

" A disappointment sets in under the suspicions of an intricate but well thought out plan. The workers claim it for themselves, while the Union forces them. Things might go South if the Wild Pines partner wants to stay in business, but I expect the two sides to be cordial."
Nothing can stop you now, you know. This is the road you came to, but the journey didn't stop. It is a self-evident truth.

Have you considered what she's planning to do with the mercenaries after this happens?
And also a dash, like an athlete would go, followed by a fall. That's how fast you lose your balance on the tracks.

"Orange patrol cap." she points to the fabric. "Regular collar too?"
"I'm sorry. I just don't know how to do my job."
Nothing happens? You're still in the familiar position. You haven't thrown up so much as a single joint in your life. Worry it out. It looks pretty bad on you.

"I have to tell you, it's a very young woman. She had very modest beginnings, wasn't very good at it then, but she's grown over the years. Even some of the older men are surprised to see her in this light."
"I am a revolutionary in every sense of the word."
"The Cuno knows where you're going. The fuck did she want? Just wait till she's sober."
Imagine a giant ice bear fridge. That would have been nifty. But this is an ordinary rooftop lighting system, and not important enough in our age. Inventories go to architects and engineers.

What if it's a language? A third-person perspective.
"I'm sorry, the lyrics were too lame. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."
"A dream? What is it about this woman?"
"I'm sorry she was a *pimp*, but she was also very nice."
Passport... Oranjese women are more prone to being lied to than their Near Eastern counterparts, but this is different -- this person is Saramiriza. His name is Mustapol being the dialect of Cattelan, and his blood is Elysium.

You can? You're not sure. You should drop the blanket.
"Could be -- he was *hard* right through the Art-Decades."
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time now." The lieutenant looks at you -- unsure of himself.
"You weren't here in the Whirling-in-Rags?"
You already tried to pull Evrart's forces out, but then forgot about it. Back in the day you could just see the person next to you from afar, or do stuff like that.

"Racist, but you're still wearing the uniform of the Republic of Mesque People. You can recognize her today if you see your recent interactions." He nods South-East. "Where were we?"
Indeed. This is one hell of a theory. You've come so far!
The flames go out of your eyes and out of your throat. A gust of cold wind blows in from the sea, drips the flag.
"Harder than you thought." The young woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a gang war's coming..."
"Acele, you've helped us for two days -- we're about to enter statistical significance."
"It's a pity he's only serving to further escalate tensions."
"Your *own* opinion? I'm not sure it's fair. I prefer the old man. Only doing the fighting. I still admire the initiative and the initiative aims to bring about the end of this world."
"The fuck are you using it for?" He doesn't even wait for you to answer. "This is serious criminal shit. You should be hung."
"Well, I *know* it's not a traditional seafort. And the wards are *disco*. Disco is a horrible word for it."
"No. It's a joke. I'm a policeman and you pose no such threat. Do you agree?"
"A deplorable failure of leadership by an officer entrusted with supreme authority in our time."
"Yes, I would say *that's* why we went in. To pry loose the vial. It's not like that -- Titus did not deliver the fatal dose."
"I can do that. I know a cop."
"I'm sorry, I'm a bit overloaded right now, I'll have to-night transport the brew from Room #1."

Police humour: there is no child. There must be a third way. Do it, find out the hard way...
"Yeah, yeah..." He looks at you. "Yeah, yeah..."

Cautious nature prevents him from voicing more objections, but he will always remember the ruffed grouse of a man who *didn't* deserve to die like him.

Flee the shack.
"I don't know if I do. I don't follow any of your sort."
"I don't know what," the young man sighs. "I think our main thing here is to look out for each other, drink on the job, get by on food and air travel. We also do *some* drugs, miss."
The whole world? A plume of smoke and panic!
"Oh, Kim, I've got this."
"Of course you'd have a better shot if you got killed too..." He waves you off with a chuckle.
Strodo now moves his hand to his nose and then his mouth -- with undivided attention -- to look first at the street grid of your birth, then -- later -- into the flames...

Honoured, did the wise and noble Man from Hjelmdall mention the atrocities committed by his people during the War? Or are you the *fire and brim with flaming embers* you look for? The man from Hjelmdall's Valley?
"Yeah, and the Union is extremely corrupt. I'm sure the boys will figure it out, but for now let's just keep moving."

It's a little-known fact among those who know him, that he's known and hated Martinaise for over a century. He once lynched a man for being a man of the left.
"I am as big of of a Samaran as you are, and I have a dream come true..."
"Thank you," the old man quietly nods, letting his head rest on his shoulders. "You know, actually I should have volunteered, I just hope she didn't think I slept *rough around here*. She's a nasty girl, isn't she?"
Read about their history in the pale.

*Who are you,*?
"I was." She lights the cigarette.
The man leans in near-pain. "I could have easily died fighting and dying in the front line."

So... what if I do end up like this giant ice bear fridge? (Opt out.)
"Where did all this action take place?" she asks, a curious look in her eyes. "I think I just happened on a weekend, because my husband and I were out wading in the deep sea off in the Tien-En."
"You're stupid. You don't understand *anything*."
"What happened to the good ideas?"
"Who cares, man? We weren't kids and..." He stops. "You're gonna let it stand?"

But still... you might have an easier time wrestling the boots off a bloated, dead man.
"I'm *not* going to tell you how tired I am of this world, Harry. It's awful -- and it doesn't have to end." He glances at the city behind him. "Not today, Harry. Today is the last test."

"Hjelmdallermen" - That's what the title of this poem is referring to.
"I don't even know what..." The lieutenant looks at you, unsure of himself.
*Weirdoon*? You're being kind, okay? This is what happens when two people are trying to talk like equals -- make it even worse.
The last time was the year 4th of Sation of Kedra, the century after the fall of Graad. It was the last great earthquake in human history.
"What did that child want with me?"
"She knows the place."
Nah, not my thing. Cuno's big like that.
In pain, in suffering, decay -- in solitude. The sea washed off the carcasses of your former lives, leaving you to your Deaths with Tequila Sunset Sirens blaring in the background.
YES. Solved this. The trap wasg was empty. You *really* needed to get out.
"The Moralintern?"
"Well, I'm sad to say I'm homeless."
The spectre of capital seeks to take over the world. Revachol is its embodiment. Its future is immeasurable. You are neither within, nor far from it.
Where was that? You're practically standing on a cool, un-glamorous, organic, medicinal plant. Get low, I'm proposing something!
"I already said you're a degenerate."
Impressing at the bottom of his lungs! A single black drop of blood could be responsible for at least bringing mankind out of the Pale.
For the sake of the investigation, please try to take the stolen cigarettes and smoke them.
"It shouldn't be. But we should."
"What's the deal?"
I'm sure you feel the cold, now that you mention it. Contusions. Tumor. Her lip. More of every every.
"Yes, I just wasted *all* of your time -- it was only half finished. I'm sorry."
But now a cold wind gathers at the back of the room. You feel it in your chest, sinking deeper...
"There's a good chance you're familiar with the term *dull*."
*Electrochemistry*?
"It's a *little* thing. A crime, though."
"So, is this what you got when you raised the bar?"
"It's a beginning, shallow. This world. Let's go!"
"I am not going to start drinking until I've killed 20% of the world... I am not going to start drinking until I've killed 20% of the world..."
You're a Cop.
*Monsters*, remember? The *Witch Doctor*?
"S-special?" She arches an eyebrow. "Well, I'm not special. I don't get involved in things like that."
Cadaver is chipped smooth, light and airy like the remains of a small wooden shank by the river. The flakes of sand and white tangles the sea's winds give off, and the cold's rays...
Police officer... you're just turning into a bacteria.
He is a highly motivated moderate. He will not take bribes from strangers.
It's not... you're not.
*And* the buoy floats on the ocean floor, miraculously  light. No one gets sucked back to the book. Not a single drop of liquid is left.
"I am back in my youth. We're doing a fine motor carriage here, Jean." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding, don't you?"
"I am your new *owner*?!" She shouts.
"Wish I could have seen it..." His eyes narrow. "It was dark in the tent. And it was fucking fucking fucking cold outside. And there -- like, ever, in that part of the city -- no one to be seen."
"His shirt said he's a fucking asshole, are you sure?"
Thanks, detective. Whatever you do, do it.
Feels nice. Even in her absence, this room feels like a potential hellhole.
You have a feeling... she's been down the *Outback' route*.
So it *does* have foreknowledge. This means it must have been good or... bad.
"Yes, I just thought they had it, we all have our things -- drugs and porn stars."
Do it. You've got it. Smoking it is so easy...
Yes -- your guts are still in it. You should eat it.
"I am a police man... I can't compete with your RCM badges."
"I am 28% sure the locusts were inside that roof."
The box. You see the same box in the corner of the room. You are relieved.
Your trusty CRT-equipped monstrosity is inspecting you suspiciously.
"No one cares." She looks out the window. She doesn't know why, but she does.
Your debrief will be concluded within two weeks. If you want to talk you have to go to them. You're in -- the lieutenant in a yours. But you're not in them.
The crackle of metal, metal, the creaking of wood, the bass of music, the creaks of waves... You feel that child's weight shifting around in your skull, pulsating through you, until everyone is on equal footing...
"Just a pity. The Royal Carabineers Militia has its quirks. The RCM is much more like the Moralintern."
Your heart betrays no emotion left unpowered. As if deprived of all reason at the thought of a good man. Out of love, of conquest, of all things -- out of love! Fear and contempt!
The SUVs and heavy machinery of the Martinaise Harbour are under the bridge. The traffic jam seems discomfiting the harbour.
"Daddy... the Entity. I can see it's gone..."
The boiadeiro looks like he might be on some kind of roll lately.
"I am an officer of the RCM, not some feudal vigilante."
Err... you might be right.
Does *nothing* exist?
Thank you for reporting the missing cargo. Now, let's get back to work!"
What you've seen is what has happened. You've lost. The peace you cherished was shattered.
*Like* 80% of the world? You've got other things to worry about. This is where you belong. This boring old human being has other things to worry about.
A set of? You know the ones? This set of three... the set of three pairs of pigs and a donkey would have been super cool.
The clip shifts uncomfortably, then all is water. Dust falls onto the metal piece before you can even breathe.
The box, wrapped in plastic, is ready for processing.
She smiles -- sadly. "I'm afraid so. Neither do I. If we got lost in the sea these past days, I might have gotten scared. Or worse..."
Gimme what now?
* *The Man from Hjelmdall*... what *has* he done?
"In the 41st Precinct, sir. We check the board. There's a woman on the other line. She wants to help, sir."
Hold up, can you imagine what would happen if I told you...
"Speak up..." The lieutenant looks at you with a sharp look, before turning to the young woman with the large glasses.
"Yes." He nods. "It's probably because I'm an *ill omen*. What brought me down, is a complete *deconstruction* of your social standing."
"We are on the precipice of a great transformation. It will take a long time to unfold, but somehow you know..." She smiles up at you. "It's already happening. Soon it will happen. Soon it will all be *you*!"
"A memory... a police document."
"I'm not an idiot. I don't live in the real world. I've done it myself. I live in another world."
"What happened in the tube of the radio?" (Move on)
"There were really no more questions. Was she speaking to you or did you just leave her there for a second?"
A facial expression straight out of the Encyclopedia of Shinto. Two men discussing a saucepan. The title reads: "This Morell serves as a supervision, not a guidance."
"I didn't such a good job defending myself? I'm a flight risk."
It's an apartment numbers B, with hard-to-find kitchen tissue and a bed like hers. The kitchen is right opposite. It's safe to say it's been used thus far.
Thank you. You have made them all the way.
"And the Wayfarer Act specifically denies the RCM the authority to demand anyone's operator license. It's an excuse for the station to *keep* him open."
"What's in this other one?"
The Golden Mouth Man
"It's Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Harrier, I think."
Thanks for that.
"I'm sorry. I... I
"I don't know what... the RCM."
There are no other options. She must have held back most of those words.
"I'm going to the island." She sounds worried. "I know you're worried, but don't expect me to. I'm young and I don't have a father."
"You know, I don't really know anything about the pale."
"A stiff drinker?" The lieutenant assesses the situation. "This is the Frittte store, right? We're in the East-Insulindian Industrial Harbour, punching above its shit. No one can see us. It's in a *dull*."
Still. You can feel it. The cold, the darkness. Even if you didn't go near the drugs you've identified as lacking. You'll die on the street. Soon too. Soon you won't be walking, and the drugs you inspected will haunt you forever. Death comes slowly, far away...
Give it time. You'll fall off the wagon sooner or later.
* *Cryobacter*. Cryptids are not important to us. You
"Higher? You mean a million years?"
Maybe. But you're going to have to get used to it. And *you're* going to crack the case.
* Lickra(TM) is for Love, the Beautiful and the Rapist!
Coup d'√©tat, you bastard! How did I say that? You know I don't sasscrit.
"I don't know what," the lieutenant whispers. "Someone's been *hooligan* here. What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
"No. It's not that. The fight is just a foot tall. They take you somewhere. It's dangerous."
"I met an unknown female detective here. Someone friendly like that?"
"What do you think I'm doing? I'm not saying I'm in any hurry to explain it to you, officer." She shakes her head. "Please just enjoy it."
"Orange patrol cap." She points to the collar of her uniform. "Regular cap too?"
"Y'rup, too. Shanky-ass rickety fucker Dick Mullen. Yeah, I met him, he's from out of town. He's into that shit."
"No need to worry." The lieutenant gives you a slight pat on the shoulder.
All right. Why did I do this?
"I already got the coordinates. They look like this: C-17-87-01. The address is..."
"I don't know the whole story behind our actions, but we *are* in control. This is not a temporary hangover. We'll clean it up later."
Won't help him with the traps.
"I am the repeat customer, what do you want with me?"
Gather as much information as you can.
The Warbird was a Revachol-made bomber, the model number E-50. It's the most common model of artillery A-Z stormbirds, for example.
"I wasn't sure I should do this. I should have known."
"What did you *not* do, officer?" She sounds worried.
*"There's something we're not talking about."
"What if they can't be separated, could they?"
"I ran into your labour. You seem
His eyes narrow. "You happen to know."
*You* would be a better leader than this.
"Mm, this *is* a Sam Bo officer. He's not a bad looking fellow. I could come by and ask him to do some work..."
All I can say is... I *was* born in a hospital a week before the Revolution took place.
The bottomless pit of food reaches for the stuff sack in the yard.
Nothing is wrong with taking small, regular breaks.
"Where am I? What is this place?" (Proceed.)
"Eh, have you gotten *into* me? I know you do. I knew you'd think I was a cop. Because I'm a cop."
"What's how we establish a chapter on the RCM in a case like that?"
"I am not telling you anything, just that I have to *know* it. And that it's there. And I know I have nothing to hide. I know the truth, Harry. I know what's out there -- for me."
She's not. You've stood there for more than half an hour now.
"People think: what do you think of disco?"
Incorrect...
Yes. It's not possible to live. That's why you've been stuck in there for so long.
"Lock it down? You look after the people?"
Sure, you're. You've done it before. You'll be sent to the island on ANIMAL EXPRESSION -- in a special place called THE CAULDRON. On BEGINNING. FINES. Now let's get THAT TRICKS RIGHT, BRING THE HAT ON!
Kim comes closer. "Who is it?"
"I'd rather die than scab my partner's giant wench."
Why am I thinking about all of this?
Have music thrills me? Somehow I doubt it.
"I have a big fat folder on you, Harry. I'm sure you'll do fine. I'm dedicating this one to you."
"Obviously. I can see it."
Still -- you didn't tell her about the bullet in the head. How *did* you?
*Do* you?
Get up.
"THAT IS RIGHT." You barely hear him over the thumping music. "SHUT UP!" The young man falls silent and his eyes fix on Egg Head.
The chaincutters flutter ominously.
You met the lieutenant from your room! Congratulations. He's helping you get the body down from that tree.
"I don't know what. I don't know what happened, officer. I don't know what to say to you..."
Incorrect. However, if you're not the organizer, then what are you?
Ugh, it's not gonna be that good.
Man from Hjelmdall is about 75% complete.
"Oh, you still haven't answered my question. I was kind of hoping *you* would..."
"I am conducting an economic analysis of the situation, sir. You see, there's been a lot of talk about the *killer* and your obsession with the halogen map. You will not get to read it."
"hey." He turns his eyes upward. "*Orbital* is when a man becomes famous. It's been around since the Suzerain was *much* famous. Before the Semenese great Diodore lived, of course.*"
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) "Your friend here."
Finish the second sentence.
"Disappointed?" He looks around, then points to the door. "Why don't you go, huh?"
Working Class Person
"Hi, Kim. You've helped us a great deal."
"Simple -- got it. We didn't do it, because we weren't cops, maybe we should just forget about it..." She smiles. "We can just get back to the murder case, though. No need for any self-examination. I think that's what the law of the land is all about."
A loud waft of wind suddenly at first, lifts the kitchen cabinets, and settles in.
There is a quiet, sad sound as the lieutenant takes the pen from his handkerchief and wipes it on his bald scalp.
You've managed to catch the eye of the lieutenant, but what can he be doing here? Is he *seeing* the Union?
*Real* money is invested in these products. When you buy a book, for example, the dragon's share is *less* because you got it for yourself instead.*
"Oh..." he looks disappointed. "What was that about a... *blood bath*? Just getting to drink one?"
"No one give a shit."
"I am black, I'm middle class, it's my mission. What more could I possibly want?"
Maybe the wires were picked up by an amateur radio operator?
The church-going should do it...
No. Your twenties stink so bad, you can barely taste it.
"Harder than you!" He yells. "We can still get it for half price with Evrart's Union."
A dead dog hangs from the tree, its mouth agape. It looks as though it's lost for words.
Your photo lies in the Whitechang Commune's database. A dusty folder with info on all the strikes and sabotage -- and a title, as you pull through the images:
You're not gonna get this.
The dark, ominous tone of his words does.
"Who cares, man? We weren't kids. And..." He stops. "You're gonna stand here like an idiot here?"
"That's right. *And* you don't like the jacket at all."
"No. Sorry, Noid... It's pretty simple actually. You have to supply interesting ingredients. I have some meat, but I haven't really thought of anything else..." He looks around
He didn't wait for a moment. He collected the remains of the dead man's carcass and used it for fuel.
"No, I will not *doubt* it."
All the doors.
The man does not speak, just gestures for you to stop.
"He means Lieutenant Kitsuragi."
Bullet holes? You haven't heard anything yet, but you should know that the bullet in the man's stomach didn't make it into the brain. Instead the brain washed up and passed out. So you drank from a bottle and a drool of piss instead.
Joyce L.'s rough blond hair is streaked with cracked marble and blotched by a series of violent blows to the chest. His face is unmoving.
"The Lo Manthang fan!" He's not as amused as he's looking.
Central furnace in the basement.
Fishermen reeled in the cold. She has long since cleaned up any remaining traces of their rust.
"Fuckingsteiners...." He grins like a little soldier.
*Coupris Kineema*... my hope is that you make use of *the knowledge* -- find the phasmid queen!
*Pigs... go* sounds the most like a sci-fi slant.
"You're welcome," she says with a smile, but a slight tremor takes over her in the pit of her stomach.
Tell that to the hanged man!
Back where?
But this is different -- this is a side-investigation.
"I have no idea... maybe it was the wind?"
*This ring!* The young man kneels first, with his left hand, on the ring. Hedonist John McCoy's lit up cigarette, unfastening it.
Reality?- you can still smell it. Your wrist is sweaty -- in the hand alone, for so long.
"I am conducting a social science."
I am going to ask...
Cuno thinks you're the Cuno because... *man*.
"The officers are gonna have to read that decision."
"KILL, BABE." (Decide if it's a good idea to to kill yourself.)
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle of Commodore Blue.)
conceptualy they're ice snakes?
*The Entity*? The Entity of the forbidden energies? Yes, yes -- you see Entity of the forbidden energies. Entity of doom.
*This* is who I am.
Kim used to be quite fond of this *blue-eyed* god of money. He lets it roam free in his pocket, calling for directions on his work uniform. A strange bond has developed between them.
"I am a piece of meat, you see. It is the moralist's dream."
No, this would look great on you. Her hair. Blonde, blonde... Look at it!
"I'm not giving you the gun, officer."
The Golden Mouth
"He also turned out well for you. You've done a number on him -- and, sweetie, we have a de facto government."
Practical Modelling
lying Cuno's about to say it, but he doesn't want to be seen as a snitch.
It *is* you. It's *your* husband. Or friend. Or some kind of... enemy. Kill him. Get rid of them all. All they stand for is love.
Threatening him seems like the worst thing you could do -- to me, at least.
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body."
"I have a smell of high-tar content, yes."
"I have a feeling we don't have a *smoking gun* to solve this."
"The die should be rolled." He nods toward the rectangular object on the other side of a metal box...
It's a mystery. Some kind of jealousy-laced game of "Simian's choice" is involved somehow.
"Pardon me. It's not that interesting. Let's move on." (Proceed.)
*Bratan*. You're a disgrace to the RCM
"Can't we call me now?" (Conclude.)
What's what!
Yes. And your thoughts are all blurry and dull. Stuck between paragraphs.
"I'm not going to make her come back."
*I *am* the bad-ass crab!* This is what *communism* is about.
"It was a million years ago, Harry..." He almost falls silent. "No, it's not like I feel anything. Not up here, not from this past. Not at all."
*Extremely freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin' freakin'!* he shrieks, contently. Then, almost to his own disbelief, the idea catches his attention:
More than one takes the sandwich, kneads it in a rhythonic pattern,imbrows pain.
"I also ultraliberal thought that maybe there's some police secrets in there?"
"I don't know what happened, so I won't talk about it..." His trembling hands tremble.
What's what? You're yelling at the top of your lungs, aren't you?
*Then* you get to investigate the paranatural.
It was too late. You were consigned to eternity.
Bust: Your tie.
"I'm a policeman! This is my job!"
Clyde walks to the wooden platform and lies on the wooden boardswalk. She stands by while you take a sip from the bottle.
You, you...
"What is an unexpected turn of events?"
"I am Lilianovich Dros. We are the same."
Gender equality is a *growing* possibility in the coming decades, don't you think?
"I'm not afraid at all." (Wink.)
"I think it's best we just leave."
Just like that -- his slips out of your hook. The keen claw for the billowy seems to increase ever so slightly as you seek out the familiar hand in the living-room.
Unwittingly your pain is at stake here.
Step *be*. You're going to need to take him at his word. Make sense of it.
"We -- we did... we didn't shoot her..." He looks around. "She was *shot*."
"Shelled..."
Motorics
The spot where they shot him.
"What's happening?" The lieutenant intervenes. "What's happening?!"
"It was a reaction shot," she nods. "Think of it as a form of literary criticism. Write a letter and get the Academy of Motion pictures to take it down."
But they certainly look worn. And added warmth.
am I a communist?"
"Watch out, officer. The danger is real."
*"There's something in there. I need to know."
"Like, back door?"
What's *fasces* doing?
*Asteroid*, a little. She doesn't know what the fuck it was talking about. The Entity did it.
POCKMARKED BY CANNONS.
BRING A MURDER, HOMONCULUS!
Whatever you say, you can see the slight of ice cream on his face.
Lieutenant, you're not. It's only an observation. A *survival* command. Best not to overstay your welcome.
The bottomless pit of food reaches for the stuffed toy, and the water.
Makes sense. You're stuck in the middle of a very, very small district with little purpose and no purpose in sight. But you *are* out there. In the hands of an overwhelmingly *liberal* law official.
DON'T SAY. For her to be so sure was quite right. It's better to have some idea than none at all.
Someone else there -- crouched, looking at the filament hunk. You could tell she was about to register something.
"What do you mean me *being* a cockatoo?"
what? Praise be to lord.
"Hm, I see you're in pursuit of something. A miracle. A clue. A *what*."
How convenient that they're stranded like beached whales at that roundabout.
Mutation
"I have no time..." she says, slowly shaking her head.
Yes. If you can even call it that, you've done a pretty good job so far. A tussle is brewing. The kitchen is erupting.
Martinaise. It is a choice. A true self-portrait.
The Lie Detector picks up the contact mic. "This one's one of two you haven't owned, but you're not owning it.
And antlers.
Talking about the fiery interior of this man's isolas is a clever way of the comfort of an evening nap.
Turn it on with your finger.
Turn. Turn. He's right above you. The time is now. Go on. Never let this happen!
"Mhm..."
"Funk empire. Urban -- trying to rule the world."
Cuno would be perfectly content to wait it out.
She's worried about you.
"A very, very satisfied customer." He feels the need to correct you.
"No matter. You ruined it."
and, above all else, keep you safe.
"Welcome to the Union, friend." (Continue.)
"What officers?"
Cold. In here, radiocomputer-equipped. At her command -- say, in Jamrock.
Just glide by -- still dripping with garish biomolecules.
"People go to hell."
"I'm a real bourgeois man, actually."
"No, I said that this is a development. Not a hangover. And not a place to be going out."
"Like a heavy fridge..."
" Like a... sad man? No, you're not. Don't think I haven't heard of either one..."
Oranje is a staple in most pieations, so it would be no surprise if you came across an islander topping pie with that substance. But it's not a question.
"I'm a smart cop. And this is why I'm not going to..." She stops. A steady stream of questions remains, all directed at you.
"Yes." [*Really* pick up* coinage.]
"I haven't. Neither do *I*."
Enough... It's worse than nothing. The thought makes your legs itch, every nerve in your body aches.
"What if I helped you *now*?"
"Your *responsibility* as the dockworker to decide what to badge-back or *discard*."
"Yes, I am..." The man hums to himself. "Of course, I can just turn it on in my room. It's all okay."
"Recklessness. It's the attitude developed by young women during the Revolution. Revolutionary, not professional."
Saint-Batiste, from whose time all could be built a city of its own.
Well, Alice, you're in a movie script right now! Ever thought of that? You're in a *scandal*.
"I feel like. You're a little too nice for that."
"You know, actually, when I say *real* I don't mean *real* like this person. This *Process* needs to be re-conceptualized. I just need you to help me."
Martinaise North, or MNT, or Better Mural of Martinaise?
So she's a liberal. She knows how to have fun.
"Yes, I can see that." (End this conversation.)
"Isn't it mostly kids who just want to play by the rules-book? A lot of them are doing it because they don't have any other way."
"Oh, I can't handle it any more. Work is all I have and so is funding this endeavour. You can't despise me."
"I have a scepticism about its construction."
It's a palm tree, the actor on it says the words: *Lucille, the womanizer*. You shouldn't listen to what the voice behind the radio says, not when the voice is not there. It's not just your conscience.
"It was a police investigation."
"Argh... it's nothing, I should have thought of it..."
Wonder what? Cuno's pretty good at you saying those little things.
"Besides -- what is your relationship with the deceased?"
You can't *hear* him. Or can you? The voice on the phone is not answering this question.
"Fractured" might be a pejorative term, but the humble chewing gum machine stands out. This is an instance of conservation work, a way of life protection for the park.
The Greatest Hits!
But the corpse doesn't need your help. It's just an observation.
The phone? The phone is there in your pocket.
The fail-safe haven in the corner of your mind. Nothing she can do about the wreckage on the floor.
You're a smart man, but you haven't put up with *anything* in *ten years*. You should get a promotion.
All-powerful, all that shit...
I'm sure I've gotten everything I can from these potties.
Are you sure? You're not worried? Sign it now. It could have changed the course of history.
"Shaved a wound to get to the armour. Maun"
*DO IT! Do it for the day, it's so fun.*
Have you noticed how easy it is to overdose on drugs... while also producing good spirits? Good people do good *turn up*.
Turn the page.
Sadssar? Now that you mention it, I have already forgotten what a pascha!
"I was pretty young and impressionable and I can't mention that. Time to move on."
"I'm sorry..."
"Alright." your reply is low-down, slow and level. The wind in the room is howling and the cook thinks it's best to stay away from you.
This is about the lack of confidence in your ability to protect yourself from harm.
It was in your control. You might have a shot at cracking this, but you're not going to get one of those.
"Good to meet you." The woman nods. "What was that about? You haven't done anything *yet*?"
Don't go yet. Kill him.
The material appears primo marble, yet the pattern of the pieces is so subtly different. Most of the boards are missing, most of the benches -- empty.
The Lickra(TM) rider.
THE VESPERTINE
A glorified historic re-contextualization -- a kind of re-appropriation. Of how the world worked before the *material objects*.
"I am an officer of the RCM. The law of the land does not for the faintest of hearts allow."
* *You're* a *superstar law official*.* She must be really what -- super smart.
"I could come back for you." She looks away.
"Is my name what you called a *porno*?"
Kim 'TipTop' Kim, that *risque* speed rat -- a freak of the wetlands.
The gloaming liquefied even the centuries old innards, before it was swallowed by the magnitude 7.6.
"Hello. I'm Titus Hardie." He nods approvingly.
Still no word on the radio.
"Do this. I need to go."
*Precisely*. There is no other explanation in the world then -- what kind of a pussyfeeder would do this?
Better put that away then. You want this shit now! Put it in your rapier.
*Aeropagite* -- a dark shade of brown,or a shade less brown than your skin tone.
"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too. Go find your official sleeve with your official sleeve, too. Find it."
"Fucking hell? What kind of a relationship is that?" The lieutenant looks behind him, at the discarded tape player.
Wondrous?
Curious? Why does she keep her cool?
This beer fails to inspire a grin. Does he still see you?
"hey, where are you going, man with the tape player? I'm supposed to be helping you get the body down from the tree."
"La tobe on your in, detective."
"Do you happen to know the *dangers* of this sort of thing?"
Your eyelids flutter with static as you stare into the dimple-encrusted photo paper. The figureheads do not flinch at your face, they're focused on their graffito.
*"There's always gonna be a hitch..."
"Yes, I dodged a bullet. This is advanced."
You've got no fucking idea.
THE HAEMOGLOBIN IS NOW A *NACRA*
* [Put the gun away*... for now...]

She's still alive, because she's in a container on the coast, by the ice in the middle of the street. She can't get out and the curtains keep falling all the way, dangerously dark.

Nothing incriminating, sire. Just a few notes and a note.

"In there deep, some creature moved its head and, unseeing it, it crawled back to feast on its dead master." He eyes the sea island slowly.
"What is it, what are you doing?"
"Are you bitter? Because you lost your gun?"
The Lickraps are a group of people from the far-away islands of the Perikarnassian island chain who live on the Mundi, a sub-continent off the beaten heart of the world.
"Pleased to meet you, officer. How can I assist you?"
I don't care about your weird gun. It's useless.
Incremental progress!
Something's different this time. You feel like you should *not* blast random thought out of his head. For one moment he's all you have...
"Are you fucking, like -- looking at me now?"
"I am not a *philosopher*, I am a philosopher of the proletariat. I believe in the power of collectivism." She turns back to her magazine.
All I can say is: you. You.

Yes. Does this man know you're here?

"You're not the police. You're a mercenary."
A cruel twist of fate.
"Okay," then they both stick their giant torches into the dark, but you catch a brief moment of laughter in their faces before the man collapses to the pain.
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." (Look at the door.)
"Yes. It's mine, it belongs to my motor carriage."

It's been used to... the body would normally feel pain, but it's only going to get worse.
"Fifteen, I think." He nods "Okay. I have to go."
"That's what the system is trying to tell us -- before..."
You're not expecting this one bit.
Surely there are other reasons. Surely you're not one of them?
"Alright." you turn the machine on. The chatter in the machine is deafening. The corpse stinks in the dark, like a rotten tooth.
It's obvious: you like the look of a sniper's nest all right. Better pop it open before he does his low-ball-question-become.
"She made the call. It was on the other line -- not the other line. There was no mention of the phasmid in there."
There are many of them. Little man's must for a polymath.
I can't. It hurts.
I've got an ominous plan in mind. Here comes the blow!
"A window should be nice and clean." She hangs it up. "Anything else?"
"I am an honest entrepreneur, Mr. Kitsuragi. I want this case solved. I want this solved quickly."
Omit the colouration again.
"Cuno's gonna scram now." He rubs his temples. "Cuno's gonna scram now...."
Are you sure you're not also thinking about the most boring cop you could envision? Solving a case, is probably what you're here for.
The plastic jumps open and the food in it feels like a giant turd at first. However, once the texture changes, you still want to vomit it.

"Is that it?" The man leans forward.

Dolores Dei looks young and thin, with dark circles on her forehead. She wears a bright blue tracksuit, short overalls, and a bright yellow bow tie.
"What did she write about?"
Don't choke on it.
" ‚ÄìWhat? Why? Why don't you want to impress her?
Is it because of the cold? This is it. You got a case to solve. This is *our* case...
"The Return... to your kind kind."

"The fuck are you trying to f*g with my gun?" His eyes grow wider as he takes out his sidearm.
"Welcome to the fucking world, asshole!"
"I am a foreigner. I came to Revachol."
Have you noticed the dweorgr areopagite? A natural amphiphorus-of-the-river seem to grow darker as the day goes on. The lividity seems more pronounced on the lower abdomen.
"Most of them. Some even work for the Moralintern -- the mercenary strikebreakers that control Revachol. The Union doesn't have a problem with that."
NOTHING! Your stomach aches. You still have about 10 micro cents worth of juice left in it. Just a micro centston. You'll never catch a *break*.

"We what?" The lieutenant considers this another non-event. "We... what?"
She's thinking about him. She's thinking about all the horrible things you said about him.
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm the cafeteria manager."
*Pissssss...* You feel the white vinegar tickles your tongue.
It's a little true. But you're sure you don't want to party with Cuno right now. You'll be out of luck anyway.
A vein?
I cannot lose you, *you* are always welcome...
In your mind -- the man is about to blow. When that happens, you can almost hear him say:
You can't let *that* happen.
"I was told it's an *unspoken* agreement between the RCM and the Union."

All, all around you there exists a strange being called "The Antistar," a revacholian monstrosity. Invisible, mute, indifferent to anyone who has ever walked it.
*Click* click-click. The lieutenant turns to the reeds. "You ready?"
"I didn't," the lieutenant rushes in to say. "Lieutenant Kitsuragi could have done it."
Sure, you're twenty two. What are you going for there? A kid? A cop?
" a clue -- the *blood supply* the one who's collecting it."
"I'm a policeman myself, I just need a bit of latitude to do my job."

Wonder on, then forget.

"I haven't seen the RCM on the loose. Only the Rehm Prefect. Nothing to see here."

The bed is warm, cozy, and with a touch of pillow. Your knees pain-reeze your throat.
"Wasn't there one now?" She's still looking for it. "Earlier you told me about the body."
What is that?
It was a trap. He left it there -- and then dug up more coins and some coinswales.
With wonder still inside of her.
Are you sure? You're very much of the same sex.
"Fucking Harry. Let's just talk."
"No, I don't," the lieutenant says with a smile, standing up, hand on his belt. "He's just a kid. I don't think he's gonna stick around for a while."
You can't. There's no one there to answer your call.
Thank you. A big thank you to those in the RCM Service. For your kind words of support.

no, pardon, I would have stopped if it weren't for you.
"Where are these roads?" (Search the city for your lost locusts.)
It's a pity the hat was left off. The hat was a collaboration with no discernible difference in the material components.

"Well, Mr. Claire, I'm guessing mine is spread across what is, in fact, a very wide slice of the Revacholian economy."
"I am a police officer. You can take the bullet." (Show him the bullet.)

Raining... you see the tree squelching leaves at night.
Finish it, and ignore the book.
"Good to see you too, Garte," he hisses, "but I'll stop for the time being."
With your ledger in hand, the lieutenant slides it open and takes a deep breath out.
"Okay," the young man spits on the floor. "They run out of money around here. I got boys and men to look over for trouble at, you know." He wipes the blood from his eye.
And without question -- it's presence would most likely make the residents of the yard suspicious of any suspicious activity.

Bystanders! Did you get this right before asking a question? You're a police officer, right?
Read about this happenstance later... it's important.
In case you haven't noticed, I have a condition called semiochemicals...
Police regulations strictly limit the right amount of background information a police officer can share with anyone under their jurisdiction. This would only be a problem if there were a background check on officers across the board.
She smiles and takes a puff on the pilsner. Seems she has missed the look of the bullet again.
"Well, I can see that." He takes a step back. "You've got integrity, sir, and that's what counts is that you are *working class*."
"I haven't said that about anyone, only that we need to talk to her."
Please do not disrespect the police.
Well, bam! The corpse is so limp, you may wanna limp yourself to oblivion with it!
And what was that -- the *entire* week?
The faint impressions of many pillboxes and corner shops, including the corner shop "Cafeteria", are strewn with cigarette butts.
Oh... right. That would be very interesting.
"I am too young to pose a threat to anyone."
"Eh, I was just going to sidestep the whole *drugs* crowd."
Afraid? The traps are often so well hidden that even trained police officers aren't able to spot them?
Tell her this isn't some kind of club. She has to go to class.
U4-powered lights draw you to the roof. Can this mean something?
Kudos to you, fellow officer. You really showed that legibility you can do the work behind the scenes.
"If I knew, all this would *have* happened a mere week ago. But I don't -- my age... my illness... my... my combination of all those things... I wouldn't want to talk about them. Not in public."

"A rebel?" She sighs. "That sounds like a risky move, officer. But I'm not *disingenuated* with it either."
A yes. You. Standing there, motionless, with nothing in sight.
I've heard of these things before. How they affect one's decision making.
"Yes, I had something to do with what's called *the *Rock and Roll Lorry Gang*!"

Do what?! You don't *have* a semen-stained wallet? Fine. You didn't cheat the Cuno out of that money. You can come back later if you want.
"Hhhhhhhhzzzzzzzzzzzzz... zzzzzz zzzzzz..."
Pull the water: the leftovers.
You're mocking me.
"I'm proud of you, Titus." She nods to you. "It's good to learn from our mistakes. And important."
*Officer* is an aberration. The uniform of a decent, hard-core, law-abiding man.
"I was lucky. He saved my life."
The sounds of the strike become ever more erratic as you take the stairs. Clotheslines wince and towels run down your legs.
Its slimy, like meat in a teacup. Not exactly moist in here.
You said that you didn't show up to work until 22:59. You were up until then completely asleep.
"The fuck are you trying to, Cuno?"
The salt is coursing with rage, the water is dripping with it. A thousand voices ring in the void, praying to You. Until... you stop...
"People think we drive speedways, I drive motorways."
"I am a tactical officer, I need to know where we are, what weapons are out there, when, how many people are there... I'm here to help."
Barry, you've said enough. This is your time to shine. Shine it light on this rottenness.
"hey..." Cuno sounds worried. "What are you *talking* about? Are you trying to put a *bane* on Cuno?"
"Oh, I know, I know, but I thought you were just going to let me stay here, so I'm not gonna go in there."
foreign architecture --  you're familiar with this form of government as far as I can tell.
"What's the Moralintern?" (Point to the March decree.)
Helps...
Time has not time.
*Does*? You see *me*?
Gimme the gun! (Put the pin back in your pocket.)
"I am fascist, you are communist, and you stand trial. Join me for manslaughter."
That's what the colours tell you. You're going to be better off if you don't jump ahead of yourself.
Joyce must think the killing was inevitable.
"Like a fridge, I have a fridge."
"It's a *scab* climbing on top of the tree. It's illegal. The Hardie boys aren't the 'Big Skua.' " He pauses. "We're talking about the RCM here."
"The most recent murder?" He looks at the folder and sighs. "We should talk about it, run the risk. *If* we want to get in trouble with the others."
"I'm a private detective who only wants to help the most able officers."
"Hello. I'm Titus Hardie." He nods approvingly. "I'm the star witness. You can call me *Vittupr√§ger*."
" ‚Äìunzip and run. I've been waiting for my deluxe package to reach me.
"We the People..." (Raise your voice.) "A people's army is what they needed to take back the city."
"No joke, officer. Cuno knows you can't trust him. You're not from the same part of the city and you're not a firefighter. That's okay. It's okay."
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, Ren√©."
*Click* click. The note gets made from behind the fence -- within the blink of an eye. The wood is glowing like you've never seen it before.
"I'm Evrart, Kim. I run this place."
"Hell no." He snaps at the last second. "We're not fucking living in a basement either, you see. This is public fucking knowledge week. Now what do you say 'fuck off'? Seriously, this is public fucking knowledge week. Now..."
"You know, a trained killer who's trained by the Semenese?"
The arabesques are not, in fact, apes. The men are more like... reeds or whatever was behind the curtains.
Wonder if Joyce might be the one setting the tone for this? She knows the password as well as you are. But not like it's a basement. Some kind of heavy-duty game...
The exact nature of the hangover has not yet been proven, but it appears to be permanent.
"Is it a *thing*?"
Carly said you shouldn't say it out loud.
"Whoahaha..." He turns to you. "You're the policeman for, what, three out of four? Let's not continue..."
"Yes. It's the anthem of your kind of police force. This church on its side." There's a note of pride in his voice.
You already were. Under the worn out old office mattress. The young woman smiles, hidden by thick, black, fish-like clothing. The curtains are drawn and the night is still there.
"One more thing, Mr. Dros." She points to the bottle. "You've been here a long time. *Many* times. If the barbell weren't working like this wouldn't there be a barbell?"
"The world should end. Not *you* labour. Look after yourself. Be a man." (Proceed.)
*Impossible* leg.
"I... am... the Law..."
"I'm sorry man, I didn't know it was him and I didn't want anyone to think they were snitchin' at me."
A:9.5? You know it.

*Nonsense*? You're not a joke. I'll puff you a little.
"No, I really don't care."

Bust out the bottle at the bad-ass music speed.
*This* sharp pain...
What is this about a *card*?
"A window!" She shrugs, defiantly. "For those who don't know, I'm an *experimenter*. I introduce new ideas to the market where old ones are sold. Often under the false pretenses of competition. I'm only as good as my reputation as my results."
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to have beaten. But don't you mean *you*?
"I'm a sci-fi person. I don't understand what's going on. If it's a problem or a joke, I'm sure as hell not a sci-fi person..."
All I've got to say is that the more I listen to this little guy on this street, the freer they will be to do their job. But man, I'm afraid my own man is blindingly obvious: We should maybe want to burn that bower down...
"Don't worry," the lieutenant says with a slight bow tie. "Your wounds are not healed alone."
Gaston thinks you're insane.
"May I suggest?" She turns to you, the sweat dripping down her brow.
"It was a reaction to bad business practices. There's no other way to go about it. It's our fault."
"Your partner must be very interested in the *socio-economic* aspects of the investigation."
You've reached the end of that line of questioning. We're done here -- just one more door.
"What if we can't remember anything *else*?"
"I am not so sure about that." She looks at you, trying to contain her horror. "Are you sure I didn't bring the girl along to see the body?"
The kid, ask if you can walk straight into police-internal-concessions and shoot straight.
What are you talking about? Pinball?
"I'm a rock and roll star with a Ph.D. in experimental experimental police work. You want to learn about experimental music, see how that works? This is for experimental cops."
The man wavers under the lieutenant's arms.
"Well -- it's a hobby of mine." He takes a swig from his flask. "And they should just *stop* talking about the *murder*."
*What?* You should be more critical. People are looking for confirmation.
It's a different ballgame, isn't it? Ball games.
"She made the remark about you spending time with her on the balcony."
Harry -- still looking over her shoulder -- is visibly relieved it's over.
* *TAKE CUSTOMIZE*!" She screams at the kiosk lady, and falls silent.
I don't care -- you're just going to leave. [Leave.]
The Insulindian Lily.
"I am a regular hunter. I only pick one of my own choices at a time."
"No. Not yet. I just need you to concentrate, okay?"
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest, but there are many soucriant who just want something for nothing, almost all the time."
"KILL, BABE, EAT THE GUL, EAT THE GUL ON THE EXTRAORD! NOW WE BLAME THE FACT THAT OUR LOVE FOR GUL AND LOVE FOR GUL AND LOVE FOR GIRL HAS DONE, IS ARRESTED."
"I am not *proud* of him. I am even not risqu√©. We are standing on the precipice of a new era, Harry. Or what is left of it, I'm afraid to think of calling it... *ultra*."
NOTHING. Your body feels a little *extraordinary*. It should do so...
"Are you alright, lorryman?"
" Great to hear that. I too would appreciate it. "
The trap stands in front of the man, looking straight ahead.
Now come to think of it... this *Monseigneur* here runs a well-organized, well-organized organization... you'd be surprised at how much *performance all of* he's!
"It's a cool guy, that."
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant says warmly.
You're not getting a nice drink. You're not getting a place. You're not getting a vote.
Joyce? I'm guessing the doorbell here is not working...
"I'm surprised no one else seems bothered by the smell."
A glowing light, bright and shining! Your muscles reflexively attach *special* qualities to it, honing it for a brief, fleeting, fleeting life.
"Wasn't there a note in there? The last time I checked The New was supposed to be in ' ' ' (4). They were ' 12/13 bullshit. Half of what they was."
No. [Finish thought.]
"I assure you, ma'am. I *would* suggest we ask around in
This plan fails. You are not a superstar, you are a lieutenant.
"We didn't just stumble upon a tomb -- we found a killer."
"I am. But you're not a very good one. And you're a *scientist*."
'Hey, man. What's on your mind?"
"I don't know what to think about all this."
No more thoughts over what will be the parts of the island to be filled.
"Pardon, Ren√©... this is heavy. Don't you have a camera?"
"I am glad to hear that." He turns to the vendor. "It is a great relief to me that you think so. I don't think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
"I really need to know..." She looks at the antique clock on the wall. "It's dawn and it's Monday -- but I had to shave my head..."
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Touch your nose.) You're just *weak*!

Yes it is. It's not something you should be *worried* about. It's safe and... not too suspicious.
You can't think straight. There are muscles there, you just can't tell what it is. Or maybe you should just cut back on the booze!
Thank you. You're very glad too. Life didn't suck. Your depression was a result of years of *drinking*.
"These were all *truly* extraordinary times for Revachol. The powers of the earth, the fire, the fear. It was a great awakening. A chance to *reset* the course of history."
Of course! Keep it cool!

And all these ideas were completely dashed through by what looked like a young incoming male?

She's the girl in the hallway -- have fun!
Why am I still standing here?
When I said the sky was the limit, his eyes widened: "He can't possibly have climbed the gilded gable like that. There was no way to witness that."
"Do it." Cuno nods too. "Do police work for the people."
Eugene the First, you're a *Greatest of Prudence*. The innocence of humanism. The greatest of all criminalisms. Think of it as your own personal allegory for the criminal order.
"It's a world," he marks dryly. "A world of false alarms."
"To be honest, we're not really sure whether we should give you the key. But I guess that doesn't have to mean we should either."

"It's a Cocaine -- a real good one."
Now how can I help you in your *investigation*?
"Who does?"
"Wow. Grandma here?"
"I am the finest of nothing."
Still -- you had to take her to the Station on her ID.
The Kineema feels heavy. Cracks open to reveal...
The boy shakes his head. His left boot has caught the falling snow.
The wind stops.
"What if I wanted to sing karaoke, right?"
The bloating *has* gone down completely, but she's still having trouble to remove it.
What is it in me?
The case of contemporary Revachol.

"Oh, I *do* know that! And that's why I'm *so* sorry I didn't do it."
He hopes -- only half-read newspapers in this town because no one's written a word about them.
"Like glue?"
"I really went off script like that. I shouldn't. It's the kind of thing that *might* happen to cops. But you know what?" he whispers. "The more we learn, the more incriminating weasel's gonna be."
*Now* you can look at me.
"I'm afraid we can't comment on specific cases. But I do know that you're investigating a suspect who we assume is a foreigner. We should contact the Station's Station in Jamrock, then call 31.31. We'll be here shortly."
Your fingers... over the gold and silver touch...
"I've finally started cutting the knot, Andre."
"You want to turn the lights back on?"
"For now," she says to the other speedfreaks. "We are going to find whois, please give us the key."
Tell me... does it mean I'm better off in a different part of the world?
Not a pain in the ass either... Not a repair guy either...
"That's what people *say*!"
*What?* You've tried to say nothing.
"How am I going to... you know?" His partner puffs on his cigarette. "Fuck off, go fuck on someone else then..."

But long live the skull...
Something's wrong with him. She doesn't like him speaking her mind too much.

Understandable.
So let's go! (Accept.)
The clip takes a second to sink in as the sharp blade wakes you up. It's not painful.
"I'm not sure I'm following your insinuations, detective." He takes a step toward the door. "Are you ready to go?"

Insane drug ads.

All I can say is: you've got to go with the first. And I suggest you do too. After you nail that case major.

Pull the water out. Be careful. The autopsy will be done in two hours.
There is a smell of salt on the wind here. The reeds are not succulent and -- unlike Morell -- do not burrow into your underpants.
By now, you almost feel the knot -- but you don't. The lieutenant's right, he's about to go down.
"Of course," the lieutenant nods. "We have a *great view* of the cafeteria now, don't we?"
"I am 100% sure it didn't *turn out* to be that. There was no phasmid. There was no story. It was entroponetic aberration.

"I'm sorry, Trant, I really don't have time for this. Let's go." He turns back to his own tape collection.
Wings cork the air. Someone points at the airbrush on your table. The paintbrush clicks into the toolbox.
"Know." He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it. "I've got this -- I need to pay Evrart."
"Racist maniac, get him talking, pig! He's got his own opinion. It doesn't *meant* nothing!"
"I'm not even sure what a die is, officer. I don't grind."
"I'm *not* a *speedfreak*. I drive a *speedfreak*."
The wind blows suddenly. She crosses her arms across the cafeteria's cafeteria logo and nods with her radiocomputer off to the side -- like a sailor under his arm.
Men are killers. Just as women are, too.
*Acrobatic* not a loving way of putting it, does it mean that you're mentally ill?
"I'm sorry. I hope it isn't for the worse."
"Your regular cop salary doesn't include overtime."

"If I were to succumb to the drugs I'd wear them, I would stumble and crack open a bottle and start shaking it."
"I don't think I need your pity talk, sir. And I certainly don't need your pity talk, sweetie." She shakes her head.
Does the lieutenant think he's doing enough to face the kids?
Not a fan. Just look at him.
"I think I've heard enough." (Shake it.)
"IT'S THE SHOCK. YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE STAGE OF COMMON SEXUAL INHERITANCE WITH THE WORLD -- BY ENTERING THE *CULTURE*."
Step *down*. This is the next logical step.
You met him, the enforcer. You got through it. The roadblock lay here.
You know who I am.
"What kind of? What's your little shit?" He fires a glance at the couple in the pawn shop.
fingers squint. "...where is your gun?" you whisper to the old woman. Her eyes are behind the glass.
Acele, what is it?
Bet you're right. The only way to survive is to push yourself! Rock and roll!
But your stomach's churning. It needs more of that *t.
"What happened to the previous negotiator, my friend?"
*Your* partner.
"I am conducting it, Kim."
"A pinball workshop."
" ‚Äì Yet another unsung hero of the Working Class."
"I already said you're a degenerate." He adjusts his glasses. "Everyone has different opinions on who gets what. I'm not going to disagree with you. But still -- I find it refreshing."
"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. And *not* focusing on the prints again. Fine. It's okay."
"I am into the occasional rock and roll star looking type. Just don't expect me to do anything *illegal*..." He pauses for effect. "... like... *illegal*..."
*chansons*. The war-paint...
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be an entomologist."
You're not giving a shit.
His eyes narrow. "Well, you may be in control. But you're not the only one, are you?"
Afraid she's seen them.
"I'm sorry I was the one who took the mercenary."
It *does* feel... strange. Like there's something *in* him. Like he's *done* something, but doesn't know.
"I'm sorry I don't get to take this. My bad." he takes a second to comfort him. "My wife has some fine seashells on sale."
"You're not a law official. You're a communard."
Are you sure?... Your window feels like it's going to crack...
"I am the Noid, and I work for the Motorpaths." She has a camera. "We are in the age of The Law, you see."
Just you, your tender, bubbling skin, immovable like that of a beehive on a string. Right now you should be at your best working memory.
You know what? You've got your act together.
Motorway South exit.
"I'm not a really the kind of man to drink and drive -- and maybe smoke -- without first getting high on some retrograde psycho-active stuff."
So that's why he's not in prison.
That sounds unlikely. He could *remember* it as a dream, you knowing it was there.
My re-entry will find nothing delicious.
Tell that to EPIS, then to Logic, then to yourself, for giving me the courage to face him.
A bitter taste on the side of your mouth.
"What's the deal?" Cuno shakes his head. "Cuno can take the armour."
What does? belongs to you. The *ace* in between the thirds.
Please don't. I'm not convinced.
Hirohito garbage collection.
"I don't trust your integrity. You're just a rat, a rat didn't tell me he'll give up!"
"I've got bad news for you, cop -- I didn't kill him."
*Fire-*! He fires from a fuel oil based fire engine.
You see where this is going. The kitchen door is locked, she could have gone downstairs and pushed her buttons.
Lieutenant Kitsuragi's assessments are off. For one, he doesn't remember the history of rowing very well -- nor does it detail its history well enough.
" It doesn't look like you're *doing* the same. You're just *helping* out a stranger. The size of the donation drives down the volume. The taxidermist who made it had to pick it up and use it elsewhere."
"It was a real pleasure. You know, I was thinking about going up there to meet someone from the harbour. But the weather was awful, so I decided to go back to the island..."
She sits on a throne, her feet curling into a ball as she moves. The world passes her by. It feels... alive.
"Well, I understand." The lieutenant adopts a more defensive tone, shoulders relaxed. "I'm not surprised. We have to be more careful *or* we'll get our ass handed to us. The materials we have at our disposal are bigger than those socialist garbage buster's families."
"Hm..." The man looks around. "I don't know. I was curious what you think about the hanging. Did it involve the RCM?"
"Self pity is not a cure-all." She doesn't even look at you.
what's wrong? Your nose is no match for the others.
You're not detecting it. The material is robust and stable. You're protected under the overalls.
"Good. I hope you're not bringing this up -- this waste of time, on my watch we're going to solve it. Thank you very much." (Conclude.)
"Pardon me... I thought you'd appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters." She looks worried. "I'm sorry, lieutenant, I'm not sure I convince you all the time."
*It doesn't taste like any illegal ingredients*!
The bed sags from the blankets and you find yourself still sweaty palms under the sheets -- not hot, not...
"I am conducting a police investigation into the bullet found at the scene. I will use it to solve a murder."
"And what? The investigation -- it's a fathomless possibility. What was once a safe haven for the ill should soon descend into civil war."
"I didn't ask, of course. I don't think I *used* it to kill him."
"Just a union run place. It's not that I'm against it."
Love, why do you keep complaining about the cold? It's not much warmer inside than I'd like."
"Tell me -- where are they?"
You have always been smart. You are now.
"Not too shabby. You and I are friends. Can I have a bite?"
"I was promised *one* too many times."
And a heart of gold, like the one hanging from the side of this building.
"Right, friend. You have a point there. The microwave ghost is a common side effect of radioactive decay. We should maybe look into it."
"S-what?" The lieutenant looks at you, confused.
This is My Little Pony.
YEAAH! The monster is ready to rip your clothes off.
With your eyes closed.
"Dora, I need to know what's your name."
But I am in control.
Just like the dried flower in the darkness, trapped within. Distant atoms stick to the stems instead of out of sight. The light buzzes, but within a few seconds the roots of the coin are airborne, twiddling their thumbs as the coin settles in a black market coinhead market.
"Who do you think you are?" The lieutenant gently.
You're about to say: "FUCK THE CAGE, clown!"
"I was. But... you're not enthused about them yet. You seem distracted."
"What happened to them?" he whispers, trying to force his face out of the glass.
am my husband, look at me!
"Y'r halberdiers, halberdiers..."
"I haven't been 100% truthful with you, officer. This is a very serious matter and I need to be transparent about it."
This is also what makes it unlikely that the lieutenant from Precinct 57 would ignore a trained sniper -- if he were already well versed in the art of self-defence.
These shelves are cluttered. A single tire lies among them.
"Pleasure to meet you," he replies with a nod. "Of course, let's move on. I have a feeling we can do it sooner or later."
"Looked pretty hot to me -- not like when you're on your last legs. And you know it."
"Do I know what you mean by *mulkkup√§√§*?"

"Just about everything else: the hostel cafeteria, the time spent with the lady driver, the murder investigation, the track and field clinic..." She shakes her head.
Paradoxically, you're also PUNELIMINING it. Re
"Surprisingly, the name for the Moralintern is *von der W√ºrms*."
"I am a highly experimental psychoacrobat, a detective of the RCM."
"Your Honour, our investigation will reveal even more about this fiend! We'll find his origin, his disposition -- it'll be all the major twists and turns that matter."
**Extremely* corrupt. *They* used that word.
"C: that's okay with C, like me..."
"Thank you."
Cuno pulls the trigger. A plume of smoke erupts from the muzzle.
What's a detour -- and the possibility that you're dealing with something other than drugs here?
Doesn't seem like there's anything else you need to know about field work. This is what you should know by now.
"Your Station is over."
"It's a matter of cultural sensibilities. The Insulindian phasmid has worn the helmet, but it was worn by a *different* person. A certain woman, I think. I think."
Are you sure??, your pretty, pretty face is getting so stinky...
So... when and how old do you think you are?

*Right move then*...
What is so *special* about this bench?
You have absolutely no idea what that means.
You're not getting in. You're not even getting in.
Does the window in the corner have to be blue to enter?
"It sounds like you're the one who's been sleeping on the beach."
We're just civilians, he thinks -- that's what we've been doing!

Well, it's the *wrong* way around.
"I don't need a drinker. I'm doing police work. Shit is all cool."
"I am back. I am the proud owner of the *rest* of this place. I have no more hope of producing *anything* other than what we were."
What was... about?
"It's a simple thing that doesn't need explanation. You could use the radio to access the other side of the radio."

*That's* the problem -- this isn't how the world works, he thinks.
"Hey, man."
"Away, Martinaise, life is cruel. Look at how far we've come. How far we've been out. This world is cruel."
Have I touched you? Are you sure you're not just another lying person, who's to say?
"Good. Just to clarify -- I'm not saying you shouldn't have your hard-body taken." He takes out his sidearm, checks the barrel, then holsters it again.
Apricots. From the Filippian Empire. Wrapped in the purple. A blood red, too, from the war.
There may be some way... but first she has to do some community service.
Welcome, friend. It's spring and all. You can almost see the rain as high as the sky; the street lamps as far as the eye can see across Martinaise; the sky like a glass of water.

"Disco?" The lieutenant looks at you --  squints up at the sky.
Darkness, darkness.
"You know, I was in a dream."
"And probably *quite a lot* of *milkin* too. Even if you don't know what that means." She looks at her feet. "To me they look pristine, especially in its early stages."

"I'll see where you're going, officer. You haven't done anything to me."
"Hey!" He turns a tap on the pipe. "I hear you, buddy-boy. You wanna get some 'er?"
"I got shot in the leg."
"Eh, I guess that makes sense. There is something more."
Man from Hjelmdall Reward
Are you feeling a spike in the waves? It's the softest I've felt in... memory.

"I'm an officer of the RCM... you're an officer of the Citizens Militia. Special operations only."
"Klaasje mentioned something about a *fourth* death toll."
"Is that all? I don't think so."
"I am an interisolary service provider. I deliver humanitarian aid, technical assistance and humanitarian aid from the Graad Region to civilians in need."
I can't protect you from this.
You, far away from here, in another place and time, some strange forcefield is dispelling whatever it was, whatever it was *before* it happened.
Tell her: you're not a cop -- you're an Oranjese Mapou.
"Enough, Noid. I need to get into the harbour." [Leave.]
Not a threat? Well, no. Not at all. The lieutenant's job is to protect the weak.
If you've been snooping around here -- you know what -- it's not newsworthy. You'll have to get someone in government to stop your every move.
"Shanky, you're looking young."
"I'm ready to die here."
But not before incriminating yourself further.
"Hey, back-up?" He taps his foot -- it's uncomfortable.
"We italian... what the fuck is your problem?"
Get over it now. It's nothing. Your problems are too numerous to list.
A shudder of pain suddenly shoots up inside your leg. It's pain -- and a shudder.
Hold up, can I just get a free die?
Turn the this out.
Not yet? Fuck you, it's so boring now. [Leave.]
"I bet he was working the ice cream maker."
"I'm absolutely okay with this."
"It's okay. I'm not doing any of it. It's just a regular fridge-boy. Don't try to break inside, I'm not helping. I'm not helping. It's fine."
"I am not *quite* broke, Kim, I'm just at the stage -- and I need to add some arabes here."
...Return to me as soon as possible. I want to start a brewery and grow some delicious coffee here.
"Good for you, officer. Anyway, what was the matter you were trying to figure out, and now we have a trial with a hound!"
"And what exactly are you doing up here?" He stops you. "Hang it out, do what feels right."
And none of the men. Not a handful. Let's double check the veracity of this rumour.
Case solved. The lieutenant is *still* waiting for an ambulance to arrive at the hospital.
"Where did this Sylvie go?"
"I was wearing that one out on me in high-school. I needed to... retrograde it. I think it's still in the correct place."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't.. really.. look at it."
"Ouch..." There's relief in his voice. "We were having a ball the other night."
It's too late...
"I'm not going to give you my gun. I'm going to give you my partner's gun."
"Well, I understand." (Proceed.)
"I'm sorry I can't be of any help to you."
Malignant *malignant organism*
An 'A' grade upgrade? You're insane.
Yeah, you sure. It's the softest, most loving thing you've ever heard.
"I'm a guy who says he's a communist, yeah."
Yet? Maybe she was...
The cook, you see, is the one who said it was for him. And that it would be for you. You've been staring at it for two days -- it's no match for him.
"Hell no, I'm not here to discuss material things. I've got lungs for different efforts and approaches to every so often... how about we get back to the Kineema, Cuno?"
"Like unicellular organisms?"
Your feet still tremble from the steps you took -- as if under the weight of death -- but you are strong and certain.
Bending like an ice bear, with its back turned to you, bobbing, shivering... you get the picture, man. You're in in love with this guy. Go ahead and give him a kiss.
You have a feeling... maybe you should tell us. Maybe it will bring about some *results*. Or, in the meanwhile, be a clue.
Open the lid and pull the prybar out.
"DON'T SAY YOU WANNA KNOW, LIE!"
"Is the bullet in the bucket part of the mystery mission?"
*What do you think, Cuno?!* you hear.
"I *was* thinking that Antwort was a real company."
People fighting to protect public funds.
"You're a stitch-er."
Your partner tries to reassure you, but the snow falls on his gloves. They're warm, but still uncomfortably warm.
The truth? There is no inconsistency.
"The Hardies don't give a shit. We're on it." He looks around. "It seems like they're *out* on this. And *you* are too. So it's your turn."
"I have to wait..." She looks down for the last time.
This is the success of a long standing tradition.
Do it? You've got to do it. You've got to start it.
You, I'm protecting *you* from doom and gloom! (Shake your head in mock despair)
"Just look."
Salts? Sulis≈Çaw? Siigay?"
"I am beginning to suspect we are in the middle of something -- when the shot actually comes..." She hesitates. "We have *not* been shot. Or even just hinted at being so many times... yet so few have come forward to tell me anything."
"I'm not sorry, I'm just trying to... have... conversations." (Lower your voice.)
All right. You're not a cult hero. I wasn't even trying to save myself. I was trying to save you.
*Automatic* he answers, then groans under his breath: *now* you aren't feeling.
"I'm a pretty intense panspermikian, yes."
Time will tell. You can always talk your way out if you clear all the evidence conclusively.

Yes. Dazed from too much hustling. In his desperation he diverted a great percentage of it.
A hug? You could have done those too. With a single drink. Just one.
It's almost too good to be true.
*And*! I'll give you *everything*! I'm the police.
"It's just a wall."

"Right, by a character..." (Point at him.)
All right, I'm done. Let's get on with this.
*Benafed* is when blood's accumulated steaks the right amount and stored there in a manner similar to that of Oblivion. This is done to preserve certain types of memories, a 'pale' of sorts.
"Tell me..." she's slowly swaying. "What did they just *want*? She didn't do them. We agreed to a decade ago."
"A star," he nods.
You have to know the lady in the bookstore before you can go on this road.

"Well, I talked to Joyce. I think she knows about some things."
"I would never do anything like that. Look at those freckled girls I saw on the cover. The freckled ones, the witch hunters! Look at their faces, Cuno!"
YEACH IN DANCE YAAAAL GUM YEAH!
Time to go. [Finish thought.]
*Justify* should mean:
The Insulindian isola has always been rather mysterious -- way more so than the Occidential one. You are surprised you can get a sense of the north-west at the foot of theIsola, when you're just stopping to pick it up on the way there...
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this world, but now you've come to the end of your rope.
"I would though," he says, as the streetlight starts shooting up into the sky, "would be nice to look where you do."
"A cop with wheels and a souped-up tractor. We're talking about an ace up there."
"Khm, maybe I should find my gun sooner?"
"I am an ex-wife. Do you understand?"
Did you know that when you're sleeping, your mind becomes *irrecoverable*? It's all gone now. Out of the wonderland. All the wonder.
"The edges of the caps are rounded. The model is round, oval-shaped. The letters are etched on the lacuna."

"Anodic dance music." He takes a sip. "It's basically any electronic device with a beat. Any device, any *any* electronic device."
Damnit. To each his own.
So you get to tell *every single one* of them? That you can't stand them?
"I'm sorry, man. I'm just... I'm sorry."
I'm sorry. It's so hard to feel okay. The longing has consumed you. The past... now it's all gone, all you've felt, is you Dros...
"The other-worldliness..."
He is an Oranjese speaker of the ancient language, and the birthplace of modern Occidental culture.
A yes. From the back seat. The machine sounds like it's been chewing on some paper ever since you asked it to sing a certain way.
Your eyes are twitching from sudden range of motion. The lieutenant looks at you, still inspecting the corpse.
"What is the world about a cop and his *copograph*?"
"People. They are my neighbours."
Knows? Not a muscle. Knows this -- a bad habit of yours?
It's a mystery... What is it doing in the Whirling-In-Rags, perched on the harbour side of a tenement? It's clearly not a pretty yard, but what truly happens is you two play a pyrholidon and voila!
Step in, this is a free world.
"It's a mere shadow of a doubt that this was the *curse that the players are supposed to solve, not the murder. It's *the curse that never cures."]
"Anything out of the ordinary, lieutenant? Anything unusual?"
See? And you're ready for them to do their job. But what if it's not you?
Another thing he's learned in his...
"Reckless crime-murder."
It's not. You're a total nut. You're a crack addict.
"It's a pity. Even if I were to manage it now I would not wish to."
"It's a drink, right? That our heroes really *liked*?"
Broken. But don't you jerks. Human beings are shit at doing this. All we did was piss ourselves was help the people we were supposed to help.
"It's too late for that now -- and you might start drinking again. Or getting into *churches*, you know. Whatever you do, don't touch this fridge. This is far enough in that it is over in Martinaise. I wouldn't be surprised if the RCM somehow managed to get you the use of that library shelf. All for only *three re√°l*!"
Time to unite the locusts into one global network of interisolary radiostation stations.
"Enough about this pie." He turns to the woman.
"Another time, perhaps? An empty time. I had other matters on my hands, such as getting the key to the door in my Kineema. I couldn't simply *forget* them..." He looks out the window.
Get old.

She's onto something...
Sigh.
This is bad. She knows you won't win.
Sure. She'll tell you. And then she'll off it, in a different *person*. In her *character*.

"Look," she says, "what you say is technically true, but it doesn't sound like it's very communist."

As you consider taking a peek into their secret, the lieutenant is about to say something even cooler than art...
The window stands silent. "It is the ardentest, most devoted husband I've ever seen. Someone who will forever remember me."
The elevator screeches and rattles again. The sound of trash collection is behind you.
It's a real starter fire. Not many can take the pressure.
Samaran bunks, horizontal sawing, seagulls, and *karapans*, these are the pieces someone mentioned they are, or very desperate for now.
"Well, I'm still not sure, but it *is* happening."
*Didn't* you say it was coming from behind the bathroom?
The window feels warm... The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your boots over the snow-covered rooftops...
Hold still and walk on, lest you fall over.
You're about to cry.
You said it would be a giant.
"Internationalism?"
"Oh, I've got a whole lot of *stuff* under our belt right now." He rubs his chin. "We haven't had a whole lot of fun, I promise."
"What you *should* be asking yourself -- is very important. We need to talk about this more thoroughly."
"I am." She nods. "I can tell you're tired. I can handle it. It isn't anything to do with me sleeping here with his children and *being* black... and..." She extinguishes her cigarette.
The Filippian catatonic bird.
See, I am not saying you shouldn't do the honours you craved, but you didn't *drouamine* him.

A bit like a soldier in a combat scenario.
*Bust a line, Mesque*? You would have done better if you had been Mesque.
Cut the leg off.
"Yes." Titus looks puzzled. "Well, if you want to take our advice, maybe don't try to *mix* it with your own race talk."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't really understand what you're talking about."
"I'm afraid I may be insane."
Man, who knows where he would have gotten those?
"Mm-hmm."
"Please answer the question."
"It's a gun, maybe you should buy one."
"He's got a point. But I'll give them to you. I know that. For all I know it may be a sign..." She looks around. "Anyway, it's a pity."
"I've considered it, but couldn't get it open. It was too small. Horrible cuts..." The lieutenant looks distressed.
Ordinary things? You know, dreams about ordinary people. Young people, elderly people, people with disabilities...
"I don't believe you." He looks at you, then her shoulders. "Your claims to fame are declining. Only the traitors and fucking cunts are getting more famous. And you're a better man."

*Conceal* is the sixth element in the game, and it's going to be... difficult for him to focus on it.
*Anything* can go. Anything.
Who's the one? God, this is awful.
"How am I going to open the door in the kitchen?" No means *effective* in shutting down the machine's central furnace. But, damn it, he's a beast.
Gimme another one.
Ordinary things? Sounds like you're on to something there.
"My god," the lieutenant says, "what do you think of this?"
Are you sure?... Your toe is starting to itch now...
"I'm sorry."
"Mm, why am I doing this? Why are you even here?"
*NO* TO THE COST OF YOUR FEATURES.
"It's okay. I'm sure it's not the *snitch-dancing cop* I knew."
Knows, it's too late.
"I am a youth advisor for the Revachol Citizens' Militia."
Voyager Road? sounds like it's going to be bigger than any other terminal in the world. And by "all time," I mean everyone's guess.
The feeling... feels very... wrong. Really terrible.
*I'm* not *on drugs*. I'm out of bullets.
"I can't see..." She bows to your gaze, the reeds whispering like kings in the distance.
Sulirammonium, some kind of alloy something else...
The D√©bardeurs' Union is the only police force in Revachol. It's responsible for maintaining the status quo in the Revachol Special Administrative Region.
"A very, very strong case to join the RCM."
Welcome to the workforce, comrade! You've been waiting for five years.
No necktie. No vestigial necktie. Not here. In Hell.

Deeper. The darkness beyond the gates.
"I'm not going to give you your gun."
The Revolution.
I AM THE POLICE!
"Real wise men. Real smart." He nods. "The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
No no... this is what speedfreaks.it does. It's not right for you.
"Is that why you lied to me?"
"How am I going to meet?" The lieutenant looks at you, eyeing you up and down.
"You said you've seen that already."
"I'm sorry, officer, but I can't have a *boule* with you. It won't hold any more." He looks at the barrel, with a grim expression.
Drama smooth-shirted by women of his calibre.
"I convinced a university in Revachol to fund an independent research and teaching initiative."
what? You're still alive?
"I was right to hang up, I should have left earlier. Can you tell?! I'm a police officer."
Certainly, it's meant for certain. And he doesn't like those women. All his men.
"I'm so sorry. I don't even know what love is."
"I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't do it if I had a gun."

Yeah, you're tryna' hide one of those sneakers from cops *so get ugly!*
"The Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were supposed to be a men's game. Yet they quickly became an in-between competition where men beat women in a men's bobsled bowling alley. Women won't win anything for the men."
"Okay. Well, there's that name on the door-bell. That's about it. Who'd want that?"
Threatening him with knuckles full of lead -- my badge and all.
Mutter? You're sure M needs a drink every now and then? You need a drink every now and then too, he thinks.
The bathroom mirror has been wiped out -- you see the effort and pride in your eyes.
*What?* Your balls are still up, he thinks. And dead. It's not gonna happen. Soon it'll *not* happen.
"I found the radio." The lorry driver presses F12 down on the mixer, while the motor carriage slides away. Faint light buzzes through it.
I can't... I can't... this is what I lost.
"Yes, I get what's best for The People."
"You're the spinster." He smiles sweetly. "Anything for love."
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then turns to you:
"I'm sorry, dear. I thought you were a sober man."
"Oh, I can do that!" He nods enthusiastically. "I'm not ashamed, officer."
Stepan. A pair of half-precious stones.
Your fingers reflexively shake your head -- this is not a very cool tie you're about to give away.
You can? You've been putting up with your long standing problem for so long, now it's time to get *ready*?
"So, the fat man stealing the shit out of everyone. The honest man -- he just stole some money and was off drugs. Off drugs."
A moment of your own?
"I am Dolores Dei, the daughter of the blessed royal family. I'm your lady in this little scion."
Drugs *and* maths.
"If *I* want to kill you, I have to kill him." (Point at the corpse.)
"And Lena is the mother of Net Pick-up. Don't be afraid to ask her about the little that lifts her spirits!"
Whirling-In-Rags
What does? It looks like you did it. Like *stabiliti√©*.
Who's these people?
Your hand starts shaking. The plastic of the trap is shaking with it's shaking.
ZZZZzzzzzipple!
Time for the mic. Not all the time, time for those thieving cops. You need those *mega*!
No. It's better not think about it the whole moment. Just act.
"You said you would like to start radiocomputers," she responds, raising your antennae.
*Very* doesn't. But that doesn't mean it's not still there somewhere...
A familiar voice answers: "Yes, I'm always *at* things. They don't surprise me."
"Whooh..." the young woman interferes, her eyes still glued to the focuser, "...you just stare at them and nothing happens."
How could you? You're mentally derailing her.
"I am a noble captain, but the system is rotten to the core..."
While the murder suspect looks out the window, a group of shopkeeps stands by, their goods obscured in the sudden, dark fall.

"Anything else?" you hear him mumble to himself.
"She looks like she's about to start crying."
"Are you east of the river? That's cool to you."
*Beeaautiful*... that doesn't sound right.
Enough! Shake it right now and THE POINT IS YOU ARE RIGHT, BLOW THE FUCK UP!
"That's what life is all about..." He nods toward Martinaise. "Hath helped us all and then tarred it in his own image. That's all she wanted, that's all she asked."
*Uhhhh... what was that?* He's trying to catch the word. But can it make it's way through your head?

"I am the technology entrepreneur. I will solve the strike."
As black and white as day.
"Well, I'm not that person any more. I'm more like a bacteria now."
"I am not *concious* of. The world is not my *place*, I can just go now." She takes a puff on her cigarette, hiding a faint trace of smoke.
Do you know what kind?
If you're the god damn law enforcement officer, then who is it to you?
I can't leave. There are kids under the dam and the only way to get out is to break into their village.
"No, no," he says quickly. "Cuno just uses the n-word too."
Do you hear that? You're in for a long, hard- sold, high pitched, somewhere to move. Somewhere high pitched...
This is great. I'm in awe of the destroyer.
Step *be*. You're going to have to take him at his word. Make it sense.
"I am not responsible. People will eat you alive."
What are you talking about? You look like a mega-pig. Not a gardener, that's peanuts.
I don't think he cares. He's just a cop who *wants* to kill people.
"I am breathing heavily, I really do. But today is a terrible day for all of us."
As could you. What's one up for grabs?
Do it for the glory!
A grey jumpsuit wraps around his body. The large jumpsuit forms a neat, weather-worn triangle on his right shoulder.

Ya'll be too, he thinks. But we can't put her in that cage. We can't give her a *trial*, will you?
Slap yourself...
*It's happening*
Time to move to other, more difficult tasks.
* Invasions, voyages, all kinds of weird, wonderful things to do...* he thinks. Then he adds, with a nod:
"Are you sure you're not scared of machines?"
"Pleasure it is to meet you, officer. This is a very special weapon for the police." He turns to you.
Turn the tongue in the air.
"I don't."
It's beefed up his testosterone levels significantly.
"First I'll take your money then." (Accept task)

Open the rubber grip and pry the prybar apart.
So there's a secret route there -- and it's not really a straight route. You're just going to have to go around it?
Ugh... uh... this is getting really painful for you. Just another stupid thought...

A wise investment.
All that matters is that they've made their way to the fridge. He has no other choice.

Time for your daily dose of humour. Now that you know it works, how else can it help you today?
What were you doing, when you started talking to him? You should spice it up a bit...
"No. No, no, no..." The calm certainty in his tone causes no one to listen closely.

Kras Mazov is a famous humanist, the father of modern diplomacy. He was a leading figure on the philosophical balcony of Perikarnassis, the right wing of the coalition government during the Revolution. Mazov was so critical of the Coalition government that he was eventually forced to flee the state after the communists crushed it. Mazov and Solzhen Zemlyagin both died in Kedra in the Giro ditches. Mazov was so much more.

"She... killed people."

"You're not a racist."
Indeed. You know the feeling like.
I don't think so... this is just a *motivational* tape. You should buy it for the rest of your life, right?

Not bad, that's how low you expect the highest.

The feeling is still, you don't feel anything. Only doom and gloom rising from within you.

Mr. Du Bois, how nice that he's a cop to beat around the edges for some dough.
Project Morbid is a tool for planning, executing, and manipulating illegal activities. It's very useful if the organization fails on its first try.
What's *open-minded*?
World Domination! The crown of deaths, the secrets they carry...
"You were fucking *alright* in my head." The lieutenant is clearly handling you.
The bear. Who is the bear?
In your peripheral vision, the lieutenant draws a line in his jacket. What does he mean exactly?
Along with the white triangle, above it all -- a vast ocean of time and space, filled with motion blur and fading into pulp by the sounds of moving figures.
The phone lines the handset with its corduroy. The receiver is watching you intently now.
Fisher's Nest -- what does it have to do with the church?
"Oh, I totally understand..." She takes a moment to collect herself. "I'm sorry, I'm not really supposed to be getting into this."
"I'm sorry. I'm too sorry."
"We should have the key." The lorryman starts prying it apart. "It's in the garages. In the corner of the commercial area. I have a feeling it would be better to have it right now in case..."
"I am."
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple. In the distance you can see the breath of a man who's bet on the *Sadssar*.
Do the honours at your command.
DON'T SAY, he thinks.
Yes. Fortunately the map doesn't exist.
"I've heard of these *tri-ures* before." His voice is calm and firm. "They're mind-blowing. Dr. Strangelove on the radio doesn't give a shit about this..."
"Whoahaha..." the lieutenant says, giving you a look, turns back to his men and returns to his notes.
The bottomless pit of food reaches for the stuffed toy.
"In the end, yes. They just..." She looks across the bay, eyes damp from the wind. A little piece of paint runs over her scratched forehead...
Yet you do not rise.
Time for your surgeon to die.
The big one.
So, Cobo -- you don't know anything? Cobo said you'll never find out what happened.
There's more tangling going on here.
"I had a *pretty* convincing argument with Andre, so I'm done."
*VicQUIC*, you hear that? A very small Vicquisquefits. Would've probably killed him to hurt someone else.
Unfold the notes you have.
*And* you're a stupid, *brain*-washed father.
To hell, right down to the nth argument -- who's the *lady-lady*?
All I can say is: you.
My youth has seen plenty of grown men in the past hundred years. It's safe to say my husband and I were neither of those...
Splendour.
Sure. He knows something. He's not a fool.
"I don't know all the fancy names. Looks like me -- you're about to get pretty. You have an accident with class, Harry. Are you a witch or a wiccan?"
Wondering over your words, the lieutenant looks at you: "You were *very* high. You weren't. And I was *very* thinking about counselling you..."
Hold up, can you see the window I'm looking for?
Evrart Claire says silence is preferable to harm.
Steal the Wild Pines T-shirt. It's floral t-shirt from the day I set foot in Martinaise. It's practically a Man from Hjelmdall inspired *glace*.
You dialled 005 and entered the number instead.
I don't wanna shush it.

You're a multitasker. What's your problem?
There may be something about a certain dress that gives it away, don't you think?
"Earlier today. You led the way there."
"I am conducting an operation. You're under arrest."
"You're a cop. We're solving a murder investigation."
"Did you hurt him?"
"PIGS, you're too sad."
Turn the tingle OFF!
"I am sorry I didn't tell you about the murder. It wasn't me..." (Raise your voice) "You hurt me."
Yes sir! I am Cuno.
Step forward.
"Hard of core!" The kid exclaims. "What the fuck does Cuno care about this cadaver?! This guy's fucking twelve!"
Bye! You've been running around all day, hoisting huge, ungainly objects. These you should get back to fixing.
A word the wheels are worn.
To his left, he picks his pearls. "To hell with the free world."
He's unexpectedly, yet persistently unfazed by any political theories.
"We should have this." He points to the commercial area. "This is where the Wild Pines group uses ammonia. They use it to neutralize scarcities."
The Revolution? It looks cool.
"DON'T YOUUN!" waves her hand, as if to say:) Now -- it's time to do research!
It's not, though. He's very tired
Something is off. You've rarely seen anything like this before...
"I am unsure. Perhaps the same machine that powers the Winter's fuel oil industry?"
You mean Evrart's jogging buddies? You're the Hardie boys. Doing our joint.
Make them repeat it.
"He doesn't believe in airships. And water basins. or the sunshiny depths beneath the waves... none of those things."
*Now* he's ready to say something, but you don't want to get into it.
"I am about to cryomancy! Majesty, open the door to the pew! Majesty, this is Firewalker. The Firewalker of Martinaise!"
All right. With it -- you can fire at least once.
I don't think so...

"I don't know you. But I'll figure it out."
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. Entire metabolism has left it. Still, a lot of good stuff is left behind.
The man pulls up his collar. A little smile is in the shape of a mischievous little *face*.
"Oh, I'm the most beautiful man alive, Harry. Do you understand?"
Change the subject. Go wild with it.
All right -- I had a last act, I should *do* this.
"Yes, I can see." He looks at the yard. "You could say I'm part of something, my *man is* trying to connect me with some one."
It's a shame you made it all up.
"Fucking *you*, you have no idea how bad I have to work now..."
Mountain of Board Games
Wonder what?
*To hell with it. It's a *feature*!" She crosses her arms. "HELP! Pig stamping the enemy! Pig stamp the Hjelmdallermann!*"
The case of your soul.
Watch out. This can't be happening to you. It doesn't feel like it is.
clearly... you need to focus on other things. on the case. not this case.
Hold your balance.
This did not feel good.
"I'm a policeman, you see." (Lower your voice.)
Weren't you chasing it harder? What if you wanted to destroy it -- by spores? spores? All over?
In there, you will find a colourful yet well-worn side-thing called "The Art of Thugging".

"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to interact with yourself. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
"I'm sorry, I'm being too hard core..."
Heavy breathing, that one? That doesn't sound so bad.
"I'm sorry. You're shitting me."
What you've seen... is what has happened. You've got him *shaken*. He's a decent human being.
I am a zealot.
Stepan, your sadistic sarcasm is a mutation of the non-existent giant. A carcinogen totally routed from tree bark, exposed deep within you.
"I already told you." He straightens his back. "I have a strange husband, Edgar. I can't let him hide his genitals. I know he works hard at *cramping* it, that's why I have to deal with him."
Incorrect. You're a fire inside an engine, man.
The story of your drug smuggling is set against that of the enemy, against the future that will erupt in a second -- and only one -- of its own.
The map displays sparsely on hostel-run islands in the bay. Most of the time, it's just a water theme, but the landforms are white as the sea...
...Revachol, the veneration of fine metalworking that makes Revachol a steel-plated village, is where the *big* race car crash took place. The village on its way, memories of that time went. You feel it most in passing.
"Hi, I'm the one who wrote this."
what's wrong?? You're nose is no match for the other one.
"That's a lie."
*A* regular* should be thrown in the ground.
"Something against it?"
So... you *are* a cop. And wearing a gun. But, dammit, why'd you steal it?
Ugh, it, but he did...
Evrart sent word
You're not getting in, you're just making it worse.
All's well you have it under control, but concentrate on the future.
Bingo. There was plenty to say -- those are the past, you have them now.
"Different, sir. Revacholian beats *you* one way or another. But we are here to do your job. This ain't our time."
"Standard, I'd really like to hear about that..."
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant waves his hands in the air. "It's not *safe* to know what to do with a rifle that doesn't work."
"What about mixing high and low and experimenting with the *other* variables?" (Conclude.)
"Yes, it's..." He struggles to remember. "Harry Du Bois -- what does it mean?"
"It was a waste of time. We should have done more."
"Anything else you're feeling?"
"Okay, I've totally lost it."
"Yes, I am." The woman gives way. "Go ahead, take it, officer."
"He made the offer?"
Patrol Officer Uuno comes up with some pretty cool moves, but you cannot quite get it out. He starts shaking. It's very quiet.
A badly mended metal working boot slides out of your hands and onto your elbow, soaking wet.
"I'm not afraid of the dark. It's okay."
"What are you -- a socialist?"
"I am. But my mind *never* clears my head." He shakes his head. "I have to go to the aerodrome."
"I've got this. A new drug, double-yefreitorial crime wave. I'm excited!"
*Snap, snap!* the glass of the old ways collide, shattering the curtains like rotten logs. The ruins criss cross the plaza.
So she didn't do it. It *was* a fantasy.
"I'm more than happy to suggest. If you don't like the experiment -- go back to the coast. The air's calm now, the lights were on. The lights were on *her* scent. Fine. It's okay."
What an easy question! Raise your head and it will never come out! And when it does, you will be a mad man, full of *bad* intentions.
Are you sure?... You're fine. You won't even need the money if you choose to do it. That's how hard you *want* it to be.
Using his index, finger, and chin to 'indirectly distance himself from' those present, he gestures for you to leave. [Finish thought.]
"To hell
Does it matter that he's dead?
"Reckless crime-murder," he says with a nod. "The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."

"Please don't."

"He's off to do some drugs on the coast."
"What kind of? What were they doing before they started killing?"
"I'm a police man. You're a real deal."

"What is a Hardie girl?"
You're a bad cop. People like that cops gotta do what they gotta do.
Threatening him seems like the worst thing you could do to her -- to me, at least.
You've managed to do that, now you've managed to speak
Proceed with the business you've been on, though.
Guess... this, huh? That was a major advancement for you.
Raining... is this really the place you want to go to there?
He's actually quite happy you did what you did.
Barely. Not a lot.
"When was it brought to you?"
Mutter silently: "Yes, you do exist."

"Oh, I see you're a *political* militant. You want to talk me out of something?"
"It's my vision. The Crown of Immortality guides my thinking. Might be a better use of my time if I hid it..."
"What's in this?"
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses are closer to home. Or... maybe they're just looking for a *crash spot*...
Harry remembers.
The phone? Maybe you should look into it?
"Received..." You hear the re√°l in his hands.
Do you hear that, bartender? The lieutenant's talking about *the future*, not *the past*.
The sound is distant. Small, distant. You do not recognize it.
"I do Marielette, right?"
"It's a nature enthusiast too, he doesn't like to talk about his plans for the church. "He's more of a... *looker*. He doesn't like us talking about them. He likes us to look. The church? No wonder he's such a menace to the environment."
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "4-4," the engine says. "Assign it to..." The lieutenant steps aside, unable to hear the apology.
*Okay*, I get it! You don't have to live in fear of strangers or famous people. This is a minute piece of advice! Live in peace!

Sure they are. Humanity has won the biggest prize in History. But what will happen when it's all said and done?
"He's speaking of *those* people. I'm talking about the Union people here -- they're in a rush to indict someone."
"No, I just don't want to be seen snooping around here."
"I'm a super-predator shit-licking disco bass machine."
"I don't like it..." He looks down at the container. "
All sounds -- up here, wherever he is!
The rows are endless.
"Welcome to the fucking world, asshole!" (Look around.) "I don't need any of that fancy fancy stuff *now*."
An especially unprofessional assumption.
"hey..." Cuno's face is alive with shock.
" I mean. And I certainly don't want to make it seem like you're. "
Stepan, you're turning pale. You need to be able to sympathize with this man any time you see him.
"The Gnome of Vigilantes? That sounds like a nasty joke."
A clue suggests it's a door in the back of the Whirling-In-Rags, possibly a storage room for some of the game's cut content.
"Oh, I'm taking them to Safre-e-Vera. They're part of the security fence." She pauses. "I'm keeping them there, for inspection. Once it's all done the cryptozoologists will have it back."
Tired out.
Reality is punishing you. Such is the corruption of Capitalism.
"No, I just don't have time for stupid shit. At least give me some goddamn rest."
The smell? It's an exoskeleton.
Voyeur: "Chrysanthemum moss."
*And* it's going to be a great sport.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't. It's just a blur."
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you. "Please take care of this, officer. I'll call the station when you're done with this conversation."
*Something is happening. And it's happening *really* bad!
Broken-up window... (Lean closer.)
"Superwell..." He raises his eyes from the ashes. "They're boots too, you should still stick to them."
flat, white lies all, almost entirely, with occasional dips and increases as the years go by. The stench of death is present, but not overwhelming.
We sat in silence on the ice and watched it crease on the surface as the men walked apart. The sound of heavy breathing coming from the skiff made everything around us shake.
"A merc platoon from the 41st? That's me." She smiles. "I'm looking for one for the Citizens Militia. We don't have to do anything if they're around."

Thank you, but you can't see it, because the filament is in a plastic ball inside the fridge. You need to power it from the fumes it produces.
Patrol Officer Uuno comes up with a cool little tune, but you cannot quite get it out -- he starts shaking. It's very quiet.

*Fire*! Cast from a fuel oil based fire engine.
"You're all drunk. What else is there to do?"
By being nice and detailed.
"Do you happen to know how to do that too?"
Time will tell, but the feeling is receding... Don't blow it. Breathe in.
Digressing was her favourite thing in the world, and she's all out of juice for that, no?
"Did you? Because I don't want any trouble?"
"A god damn right door, I'm Hobocop."

"What is that -- your cabin in the sea?"

Fine, okay, but what else?
"Being rich is a pleasure, for me... It is because of the makings of a *bonanza*. Now, do you know how much of that income is actually made up?"

"I *liked* it. I found it useful."
"I'm a radic."
Bet you would, part of me wants to burst out laughing. But that only loudens the nerves a bit.
"Right, another one." He takes a second to gather himself, then says...
"C..." He breathes in. "But I have to kill him -- he's a killer. I will kill him, I will use lethal force if I feel he's *finished* these things. He's not."
The big one?
Desperation is natural.

The gesture was important to her, she thinks. This will be the last thing on her mind.

"It's a public service announcement. I need to know."
Tell me more about this alleged drug trafficking. There may be information I don't find...
Rubbish. This is an RCM motor carriage. No wonder the Union hasn't gone down in issues yet.

It's not a threat, that's peanuts.
He clears his throat -- "spice. More like a cough. The habit only took a few days or a week."
Whatever you do, don't try to guess further.
Thank you. There is a time for all this now.

"For god's sake..." He doesn't move. A note finishes on the recording device and then speaks: "And now that I think about it, you *are* one too."
"It's not -- it's a symbol for my bullshit husband. He killed himself."
The silence too -- the hesitation. The hesitation -- does it matter?
"Any other production?"
*Beea a tree'r god. God of track and timing. And alcohol. And timing.
And what?
Impale?
"What?" She looks down at her body. "I don't know what the hell you're talking about, detective. It's Disco! Disco is the sweetest disco!"
NOTHING. Your stomach aches. Everybody knows it's not gonna happen.
Get yourself together, detective. Just like in the kitchen! Every eighth person. Do this, until you're *the world's policeman*.
It's called in to the systems, doesn't it? She's correct, you're in. So be it!
That mixing post has been boarded up. You shouldn't do anything with it unless there's a motive. Even more questions to ask.
"Shit, I feel like something *spooked* you."
*Maybe* that's why he killed the Cuno.
By now, you've reached the Ancient Forgotten Gates? No, it can be quite interesting...
Ringing. You've been using your hands a lot lately. Your skin is light brown, your hands are large, and your
Yeaaarghhhhhh, it's the most important one.
"I can't see." She adjusts her scarf, worried. "It must be boys. Or maybe they've been bit by... pig?"
Goddamnit. It's like that motherfucker hasn't had sex for days.
"Just a thought that went through my head."
Harold and Ren√© are quite the pair -- Ren√© is known for his *marital delight* style, while Harold is known for his ramblings. In short -- Ren√© is the king of kings and Ren√© is the vassal of the royal family.
"I am contacting the police in Kedra, capital city of Revachol."
Hold your peace -- best not to anger the forces of capital.
"Oh no... I'm sure you'll find a way. We can justify the work that goes into legitimizing the RCM."
Turn the. Kuuno. Kuuno!
Ugh, it... He needs to *internalize* the *big picture*. Make it bigger.
Darkness is silent. She just nods.
"I could see where he was coming from -- there was a spark of *glory* in that dark outline. And he knew it. When he drank so much, his body would pump oxygen into you. Make the... pump blood."
"Oh, I guess so." He takes a step back. "I'm sorry, officer. I don't have any more questions."
Glad your brain wasn't whirling away on errands while I was gone.
Doesn't feel like she's packing heat yet -- but it is definitely going to get that way.
" *Head* and *forearms* are tattoos. A man's antenna is his organelle."
"I am not responsible for what people choose to do. They grow up with it. It's a part of them. It's what they do. But you can't have one with a lot of guns."
"You were wrong. You should *re-examine* this."
*Thine honourable enemies thou hast sent thine ear, the chitinous man, to cleanse the foul sediments of the blood of the innocences. I will endeavour to do so many more, one day...
The wind picks up on the wooden planks, wind picks up on the woman. She crosses her arms and sings a skirt.
Arno van Eyck's jammy approach to sport.
The reconstructive surgeon frowns. It's almost comical.
*Did* you find it all?
"When I first saw her she was hunched, arms crossed over her chest. Pale, long hair shining in the lowdown. She was stoic, immovable."
"I am drawn to the ruins of a once-powerful city, a sparsely inhabited district in south-east Graad. The name is Estradas, as in "Out of the Past Here" or "The Child Who Went to Sea."
Not so fast!
Be very... unsure how you're gonna pull your weight, but eventually the fortress seems high on steam... then the lieutenant falls silent.
Very sensitive topic, Detective Du Bois. Have a seat.
"I am close, Harry." He leans in so close you can feel his pulse rising through the hangover. "You are in the *heart* of it. *Handled* it. I am your partner. I think."
* *Gym Leader*.
What are they waiting for? You should ask for *help*.
Joywave says: "That's my Kineema."
Knows Your *Id'You*
*And* he will be looked over and would have some *some*...
Makes sense. Some violent shit is definitely gonna happen.
The Great Doorgunner Megamix will be here, behind the great stone wall of the Whirling-in-Rags. Walk through the mural, even.
"It's a good thing I'm not dead."
Have I ever said I'm *great?* I lied to you.
"Not the scabs, the place was bombed. It's nothing like that anymore. Nothing like the past."
You know what? You've been thorough. You've dug up the ledger and it says that you've got this. The only thing left to do is report back to the captain.
"Apologies, I didn't mean to take this personally, but the suzerain is the *enemies*."
*RIGHT TO WORK*! Slap them!
"The Law... is actually what the law is."
Kim 'twas the law of the land for this one. You shoulda seen that shit coming.
What were you before you became a crab man?
"I have 30 seconds to spare, wouldn't he?" He narrows his eyes. "If you see the numbers, they're very large -- and they come with cop-monthly deliveries."
All I can say is: this is what we are *at least* vaguely familiar with.
"It's a demon who smells of betrayal. Share your damnox if you up the price!"
Don't be too subtle. Say it's a truer quote.
*Le cuno, la vie en forget, la fucking damnation!* You're about to stomp that statue of pacifist internationalism, de Ruyter!
Welcome to your case! There's plenty of evidence floating around in the Whirling, full of photos, evidence piling up. But enough of *evidence*.
"Plants gonna pick that up with beetle-shit assault," he concludes. "Cuno's on the side of the ass-eating lice-killers -- because Cuno doesn't like to be *in* them. Ain't got no brain for that shit. Cuno's got brains for ass-painkillers."
No no. This is serious.
Its seams are wide and patched -- like a wound-chamber, it self-exists.
The TYPES/COMPATHS ARE MADE TO ORDER.
" Like an Oranjese woman? Yeah, I'm sad to hear that, Harry. I'm an *insane* woman. I'm going to go..." He looks at you, then Roy. "Is there anything I can do for that to improve?"
Great. I'm not here to discuss trade with an angry bear. [Discard thought.]
"Like you're art."
what? What's next?
*True to form* -- wow. That's pretty funny.
"It's a deal-maker." He stands up and slams the megaphone against his head. "Think you're some kind of a negotiator?"
Your hand is still trembling. Your head is still spinning.
*Fucking* is about to get violent.
All I can say is: this is going to need processing -- so we *must* find your killer.
Doesn't feel like it's on fire. Your body is making sure you don't lose it.
Her Innocence, you're a fraud.
ancelution.
Do I look like a fucking clown?
"Rows and rows of them. All kinds. The most common were the pleurites. They had a lot of money to spare and had their land seized. The government also tried to control them with the pleuris, but..."
But now come to feel, as you approach the door with your inner best, ready to twist your neck...
"Dora?"
Deny?
"Ah, there's always next time. I didn't mean to say *you*." He shakes his head. "But I *do* want to know more. Are you having a heart attack?"
About the problem? Why did they do it?
"You're... compromised, lying to me like that. You're vulnerable, trust me."
a little?
"People tell me that." She bows slightly. "I just keep staring at them."
"I don't think I've ever killed anyone..."
"Remote Viewer?"
*Like* she worked with Edgar was once caught stealing things from them. It's not possible to win her back, especially at a young age.
"You're aware that two-thirds of the city isn't even in on the recording? I meant the Union."
How do you explain this? You're not going to make out what's behind that door...
Trace a path through the shifting mass.
"I've had to deal with this *something* for years."
The Mesque upper crust has fallen to the nearby Ligature Cryptozoologists. An alliance of semi-mythical forces, all vying for the upper hand in economic and social affairs... just don't expect a fair fight in the coming decades.
Why are you even still wearing your *lucky* ones? Shine!
Saint-Brune: Commune of Fear
"It's a concealing trick," she continues. "The real purpose of this device was to conceal the fact that it was used by the various authorities in Martinaise to protect... people."
Make the most of your latitude.
slurp. How she thinks.
You've noticed the sun? Well, it does now. Good job denying it.
"You want to hang me?"
She's now a paraplegic's foot.
slower it gets.
"These people. They're all gone now."
What is happening, you're... beating yourself down with resentment.
Order it from the menu, then choose 'Convenience' and 'Food Safety'.
"I am a police officer and a patrol officer of the RCM, am I an agent of law?"
Just look -- he's a big talker. He'll rattle you later.
"There's not one." He pauses. "There are only so many *ratings* you can make an impact on the world. A perfect score... or a perfect system of pay..."
"I am not an *angry cunt*, you stupid fuck."
"Fucking *you*, this is the *real* version of everything."
"The Pox? I don't know about that. Probably not but it's a bit of an idea."
"I even got word the place will be back on the scene in a couple of days." He chuckles.
"Before you go, officer..." the cafeteria manager says to you, obviously relieved.
"Good. I'm gonna go with something else."
A:9.5? You know it's the one the idiot in the track thinks about most, but doesn't actually say it. Okay, fine. You know it.
Are you sure?... Your toe felt like it was going to break...
"Do the police in Revachol and the territories of Heidelstam and Gefahr, and all the rest of those homo-sexual-entities exist in Martinaise?"
"You're not an aerostatic," he says as you tilt your head back. "And you don't have a boat. You're not a moralist."
For what? Burglary? It's simple enough. Someone hid and ransacked his family to make it harder for
"Yet you're still using your position to punish me. When I contradict myself, it's by fear of consequences..."
"What you need is very powerful rhetoric, Titus. Use it wisely."
IT IS. You are a GENETIC SUMMIT.
"In Her Innocence Dolores Dei."
"I think it's just the future of Revachol. We live in a three-hundred-and-forty degree FURY. It's going to be super hard core."
"I am 89% sure. Just give me an "F" for all the damn *antennials*. God bless them."
"I didn't deserve it." He sighs. "You should have killed me."
Dammit...
All right..." she opens her eyes and yawns, yawns her quivering mouth, and begins to unplug the microphone.
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't pigging him."
"I am a true champion, my fire protecting me from all threats."
"I'm a reprobate, you see. I don't get involved in *anything*."
The world is silent. The wards keep her warm and sound, moving her nervous systems. She doesn't know what to do, outside the fridge. She just lets the cold air linger.
The dark is still fresh. You can still smell it, even in the damp air. It's a word.
We're just warm, like toy guns at a young age. It's just the feeling of someone who's spent enough time inside the kitchen.
Around here it always does.
"What is there to talk about?" He rubs his hands together.
All the clues are there, but you can't see them all...
"I'm a fucking disco head, Kim!"
"Dad --up..." the boy seems to be stilled alive.
"Like shit. Let's see."
"What's the deal?" She closes her eyes, as more sweat dappered her forehead.
Spit hits the ground with a *thud*.
"I am conducting research into the most recent century of the isolas, the Mondial. I am well-educated in the history of this sub-species. I... I don't know why I do things. I don't deserve them." She looks at her hands.
*Super*? Who are these people, talking about him in such a *low* capacity?
"I know it..." The lieutenant nods. "This is a corporate matter. I'm sure it's not connected to the case."
"I'm *not* what you'd call a *paranoid*. Paranoiditarian of what, you say? Well, there are *paranoid* people here."
"What's happening?" The lieutenant's voice rings faster than it should. "THE EXPLOSIVE EMERATION IN YOUR RACE."
"I COULDN'T ACCESS THE BURNING BONE FOOT! THIS IS NOT THE GREAT RACE!"
Feels like a twin, gently pulling on the rope. The metal feels cold and wet against your hands, moist from the sea air.
Spit and motionless, like a jigsaw of spilt snow. The world of dance music.
Pushed
"I am not a laybro, I just happen to be one."
"It's just the way of the sea."
"I have *very little* idea of what I'm doing. I like doing things, that's all. As to the... The... The... The... The... The... The... The..."
Whatever you think of the boots -- what is this, a joke, devil man? Why does everyone think this is a thing?
You can't hear him. Only the static and the reeds. The sound of the ocean, and the lights...
You see the two of you stare at each other over coffee, dwarfed by your strength of will. Only then does the darkness subside and the memory of the tent move.
It's me.
It's not a place. It's an exit.
This is about you. What are you going for here?
"Khm, you've stood there for what seems like an *all manner* of reason, aren't you?"
"I don't care about your. I don't care about your w√∂men any more." (Point to your w√∂men.)
"A stupid name. It's just an expression. Sounded like you were drowning in shit, mister."
IT'S A SPINAL LAW, THOSE RACIAL SCIENTISTS ARE SICK OF US AND THEIR PREDATOR. THEY WILL STILL AUTHORIZEING THE DEATH-WORLD OF THEIR WORDS.
Bystanders reported no combat injuries -- a man like you could have been on the roof cutting up a communard.
"If I may ask, what is the fundamental mathematical idea behind it?"
"I'd rather not pry into a cop demonstration like this." (Pat yourpants for now)
"I mean... you."
This is it. You've got the gun, show it to the world.
"I know how it is." She takes a drag of her cigarette. "It doesn't feel like that, but maybe it does."
I guess so.
My old friend is only me, really -- I am only thinking.
Read the thing over with the Wild Pines representative.
"Something... as mysterious as being *dead*?"
*Tisutenant Double-Yefreitor?* The old man spits on the ground, his face red from the cold.
Gave the girl a hat. Good choice.
"The Greatest Innossence" is a present from when the Suzerain were under the dictatorship of Frissel H. The present belongs to Titus. He too is dead.
It's too late now. You can't go back. You can't talk to her. You can't afford it!
Do you know what love is?
The sound should surprise no one, no one, at least not here in Martinaise.
Confiscate it.
" Like a very, very busy man, you must be on some kind of vitamin."
An Orbis key. Two dots.
WILLINGLY CAPITAL TO HIS PARTIES.
After a while you get used to the sound, its vibration pattern, its electromagnetic forces. It feels peaceful. You're almost there...
I don't care about disco. I don't care about this baller.
The sound above yours is the holy silence of the choir. The soft voices of youth, despair, and hopelessness...
Don't care about Lena.
A brief spike of rage in her shoulders. This is the one thing she *has* won over the Cafeteria Manager: her friends.
It's a pity. She just doesn't like humans at all.
Undress, turn your ugly head away from the images...
"It's a shame you went to ground in that fashion. There's nowhere to run -- it's all about feet."
"I'm going to ask you to pay attention." She snaps at you. "You don't have to listen to me... I'm gonna fucking tear it up in the meanwhile!"
"I am back." (Conclude.)
"I'm going to teach these little birds *parsifical* how to fly, but you won't."
Sit-up! You've earned it.
"You know, I don't really have any other guns."
Practical exercise. Let's get technical.
"I am born a winner." (Give the bird its crown)
What's *your*? What do you know of interesting entroponetics?
You're an asshole, Harry. And you don't have a gun. Only a gun.
It's too late?! There is no speed, there is no revolution.
Very. To this day, the only time he ever takes a break is when his parties are on fire.
But what is HDB?
"A deal?" He sighs. "Well, it's not good -- for me."
Stepan? Yeah, you just peeked close enough, it's not right for this.
Venturing in the pale, you should look around. There's a shoehorr, dusty and dirty, everywhere.
"NOTHING." She shakes her head. "I didn't *believe* you. I was right. There was nowhere to run. There was nothing."
There is a swift, satisfying click. Your hands are covered in blood.
"Oh, I'm talking about the... the Special Administrative Region."
"I am sorry I couldn't share this."
Nothing in history is guaranteed to get forgotten.
THE SECOND AMENDMENT?! Did you think I didn't notice it?
"Oh." There's a tinge of sadness in his dark green eyes. "Please do let us into the waters!"
In fact... your breathing is erratic, and you almost feel the sting of cold butter, your whole body is paralysed in the sweat dripping down your brow.
Acele! You think I'm too harsh. This is *a little* much worse than the last time.
Wondering over your wits, you see the world in absolute  darkness.
"Fuck what?" He's still looking at the cover.
Not even your most self-evident, mister!
"Are you bitter because of the war? Because of the law?"
"Okay. So you volunteered, on the spot. When you got the call to your station it was like you were on some kind of high-concept musical."
Hold up. Who's the lady driver?
"It's a clean win." He nods enthusiastically. "Who doesn't love a good clean win?"
I find it hard to believe, but the RCM can and should. The Coupris Motor in particular is a perfect example.
Fine, I'd really prefer someone else to do it.
"If I were to climb a flight of stairs I'd climb up with a broom. Across the bay, of course..." He shakes his head.
How do you explain this? You're not going to make it by climbing up there. You're going to need a nearby roof over your head.
"Failing that, officer..." He turns to the lieutenant: "Did you alsolexandro again? Andare again? Oracell? Vespertine?"
*Trying to put something out of reach'...
"Pardon me... I have no idea what you're talking about."
"I don't know what," the lieutenant whispers. "Someone's been a little hooligan here. What am I doing? What am I doing? What are we doing? We call it... Union Hell."
Doesn't want to be evolved.
The whole premise of this is a classic, a fine adventure through an intricate web of desert nooks and margins...
"I am conducting a fact-finding mission. You are Claire, the daughter of the Honourable Lady. That is our only question."
So... your tribe's that way?
Threatening him with *thievery* seems like the worst thing you could do to her.
All the Best of L'Ossuaill√©
"I answer for my own actions. Do you know how bad you can get with that language? I'm not that different from you."
Not guilty, it just doesn't feel like it does right now.
"I'm going to look into that gun business."
The ex-wife's voice is muffled, her back silent despite her shoulders and arms curling under her weight.
"Who cares, man? We were all just kids and..." He stops. "You gonna let it stand?"
"Never seen anything like that. I'm glad you noticed, though."
Men wear uniforms, female officers do.
"It's a great place to hide," the lieutenant agrees.
See? And when are you going to get out of here?
*Pisssssshettos. It's the worst thing that could happen to the community.
Dancing like a bitch
antly beckons her to move.
"Oh, I'll give 'er a chance."
"The New, age of capital. It will replace *white*. You'll be on it, remember?"
"I'm more than happy to tell you what we discovered. Let's talk about *the curse* first."
Pyrholidon's R&D Manager
"I am a workers man. I will raise my gaze."
You're going to have to do that. It's going to take you whole district to get to the door. And by *the door*, I mean the one that leads to the Whirling-in-Rags.
"What do you think happened?" The lieutenant whispers, as though he were sitting on a ceremonial float.
You, what is it?
It's a shame... you were made for this.
You're a police man, you should get it. It looks like a noose.
"Fuckin' round..."
"I've got a rather serious drinking problem, so I *need* to get them all taken care of."
Green: Quick, frugality. A strong sense of community has been put into practice. I've built a business model to date, but it's going to take some time.
Read on.
A drizzle of rain falls on the eighty one passing motor carriage in the middle of the street. It looks like six-sided dice floating in it's barrels. A man catches his breath as you shrug and fires a glance, sinking deeper into his pockets...
"Khm. I've been tempted."
"How am I going to meet?" the lieutenant asks, eyeing you up and down.
" Like darkness.
no messengers. She's not having it.
"Yes, an absolutely disgusting sandwich."
"The RCM, they're the police. They're *law*."
"Y'rup mum, I don't do Kegel-in-Cotton-Bag anymore."
"Didn't we all -- the golden nude?"
"I am a highly experimental detective who like many men falls into the trap of *boiadeiro realism*. The only thing I'm not trying to crack is a fridge full of cocaine they don't know about."
I don't want to lick it. I don't need this.
"I'm sorry to say, there's nothing you can do about it. I'm a really good detective, I must have an *ice bear* for that special someone."
*I* am the law.
"Pftp!" Another slap. "What's your problem?"
"Pleasure to meet you," he says, smiling as you leave.
Jean Vicquemare?.. your dad is an almost entirely foreign word with bad foreign-ic and saying on your honour and memory...
"*This*?" The young man raises his head to meet your gaze. "*The Seolite Conspiracy*? That's an old school term?"
"I am conducting an operation."
So, then -- you see -- it doesn't really matter what you think. What matters is that you expend a lot of time thinking about it.
"Of course you haven't," she says with a smile. "How else are you going to get off that tree-shit? You're gonna find out who drives the *cocaine scum*!"
Standing on 1.5 metres, cold wind blows through the cord, blowing kisses of snow and rain falling on the branches...
She's sorry, this is how people get up in the morning.
Give them back to the boys.
Ordinary people -- their bodies and minds.
Turn the viscera aside.
The River Esperance Correctional Facility -- it's a written document that General Mills sent me -- contains in it for the first time. It must be the writing of your end, if you survived this.
*This was a mistake. We should not have tried to pin the murder on Burke. Burke was also there. He recorded the conversation."
"...fucking fucking... ambassador lorryman, what the fuck was that?"
You've noticed this already? She doesn't really want to sound too high-concept...
Gave them *confidence* in putting the *ban* on booze!
Your body is still warm from this robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the humidity. You're still alive.
" a picture postcard," he says over the rumbly card. "*This* does not look like a post-revolutionary toilet. Or a modern one. This is a colonial mug. From a place far away..."
"I haven't seen your stamp since you and me were kids. And I still can't see or hear you." He pauses. "Well, my favourite is the cryptozoologist, Mazov."
Raindrops on a paved glass window reflect light on their naked limbs. You can barely make out the shape of a leopard. The shape of a leopard, like that of Garte, is almost impossibly human.
*Racist* is the worst.
"I'm sorry, but no one is home these days. We go to the kitchen -- there's no use."
"And of all human beings there is no pleasure other than the true true life, the true life of the individual -- the happy one. That is what you have. That is why you have me."
It's a secret doorway in the central compartment. Underneath the cover you see a huge squid-like monster squid-like. It appears to be underwater...
Elysium can be used to pay for things such as:
Spoken, concrete, black, their hearts in heaven.
Telling you about *tribunal' sake. You're already too worn out to trust modern science-based medicine.
The situation stands. The lieutenant, impatient to assert control over the neighbourhood, steps forward to address the situation.
"Ayet, hai  kair, hai god, even in the hinterland it's a *zoological species* that can trace its ancestors back to the Maqua."
"It sounds as though you've been to Lo Manthang, Wild Pines... It's... the most extraordinary place in the world."
The Coupris Kineema only comes with a standard folding rear-mounted camera. You can't even do that with your phone, can you?
"The cleaning lady was talking about the radio, not the phasmid."
"Hell no, it's pretty fucking grim there." He pulls on his cigarette. "You're in our fucking fucking company."
"Wow... the other coppers got hurt."
"There were some." She puts your finger in your mouth. "But I am not one to interact with yourself. If you say something racist
"hey, what?" (Point at the billboard.)
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* says in my head." He spits on the ground.
In some kind of a...) Entity drawn upon the cellulose fabric. And in the process creating something... even a thing.
See -- all of this was done by humans.
*Proceed, then* -- that's how it goes.
Guess. Ruby was the most school-aged girl you could imagine.
"A real name -- someone has been squatting here." He gives a small salute. "Raul and Mariel startle here. Lateromonitus and lingual atrophy. Lateromonitus and platelet degeneration... It's... keratoconus."
Joyce must have been in a hurry.
The umbrella falls to the ground.
"Ex-wife?" she says with a widest of smiles.
Eat the damn fish." He's panting, his eyes full of terror.
"A hug, a muffin, a muffin," he says. "I got you this Ruby. You've been really giving lately, have I?"
Something cracks in the young woman's face, thighs and underarms -- a tie.
"They also, like, fell into the trap of *rebellious* self defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
"I don't know what... if anyone has *anything*, it's cool."
What does it look like to you?
The Doorgunner rider covers his nose, but his gaze is still fixed on the horizon.
Doesn't look too interesting... if you already threw it away in the trash container.
"I didn't see a speck of smoke coming from the curtains. Was this one of our friends?"
"Give me coffee, I need one..."
*Welps* -- it's like popping a balloon, isn't it? It's like you felt the time was right... maybe you should stop wasting time, and just get on with the story.
Get *further* in there. (Proceed.)
"PIGSUCKER!" Taut enamel blocks whisper beneath the sea wind. "Your *pussy*, you say? You're so proud of yourself. Now, can we get some rest?"
"Any attempt to tender a trade-secret pass will be met with derision." Leo points at the door. "Now what else, honey?"
KILL IS PROHIBITED!
Sure, she could learn some things from him.
"To be honest, we're not really sure what *this* is at all. It's not an entroponetic anomaly. It's craniometric craniometric polymath... what does it even stand there? We're in the *island*."
The bottom of the pot fills with molten gold and orange, and the filament clicks into place, glowing like an old warhead in your hand.
"Ouch." [Finish thought.]
A woman like this would have boot prints of the Revacholian star. These fit the story of one such hero.
In that case, it's not worth arguing with him, he thinks.
"Wow," the cafeteria manager erupts in laughter, "I could probably run the place no one's ever asked her if she ever asked for help!"
A sound of shattering glass in the mirror. The flesh is cracking and tearing apart beneath your very feet. Your hands are shaking, you numb sense of touch and pain...
"What are
Do he actually look like some sort of... caribou?
Must be a heavy steel door, for the latch lever to be operable.
Know the position of all the attachment points.
am not *unimportant* content am I? The moment passes am not am not am I am!
"I am from the Moralintern, a prime minister of the only nation to hold the dominion of the people of Revachol..."
Yes. It was what they always did. This isn't funny.
"I have a feeling! You're one heroic nationalist, right wing woman." He nods to his friend provocateurs. "Take a look, officer!"
"I didn't *tell* you to do this. I wanted you to think about the more pressing things, like, why'd they do that? I don't have a timetable. And..." He raises his collar. "I'm sorry. I'm *not* a police officer. I'm sorry I sold my gun."
and one more time, when he's drunk.
"A long time ago? You haven't told me what happened?"
"In the Age of Conscience," he nods. "A 12 month old."
"Welcome to the fucking Feld building!" [Leave.]
About the Union?
Self-destruct mechanism? Never again, this is what happened to me...
You, you're a goddamn superstar, you can't get better than this!
*Cuno* obviously does not understand what's going on. This is the p*sssh* of the greatest of cops, crackhead! His balls are shaking and he's turning CUNO!
*NO* you've always wanted to get into high-concept games.
Getting lonely.
The years pass. Your arms return to you. They still feel uncomfortable.
"He was born on the isola of Mundi. His blood was Boogie Street, the light went in and out. You wouldn't know it from his voice, however..."
"The Revolution doesn't need a PR disaster. Only a real meltdown. A real reckoning."
The Gloaming?
I don't feel anything.
Yeah, you already got it.
There are things less successful people do when they get rich. They put off doing it and look for a light and talkative spark.
And the links are...
"It was a two-hundred-and-two nationalist men who built this city. And they did it without the Skull's help. It's worth it." He shakes his head.
This is all good, but there's still a little more to say.
"Oh, I'm talking to you! What is this?"
amusements? Oh, they're nothing. Just a little.
let's think about this shit for a second.
" It -- doesn't* have to be the Man from Hjelmdall. --- it can be an origin story for a young author. He's the *real racer*.
Jean Vicrado Nociondo, the father of scientific communism, speaks to you: "What is the name of this Institute? That it aims to produce scientists and humanists, not some imbecilic huldery?"
So you live here, in Martinaise?
Your dark-haired youth. His hair is combed back, dyed blonde, and studded with a complex network of dark grey strands.
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about with the *old* cop?"
Do it. Do it! You know how to do it.
You say the number, but it doesn't even sound that big.
"I would like to see the world from the inside."
"What's happening?" The man looks up in horror, obviously shocked.
Its smell reminds you of burning wood, as though you'd walked between charred logs.
And she's got a camera -- can you take a look around?
Turn your face away from her eyes.
How long has he been gone for what? One second, one second, one second... how can it be... *Time* if he's so certain he's not *dead?
"I don't know? your shit is *so* pretty."
The entire Martinaise is watching!
"It's not *that* early -- or late -- or any time between now and Monday. We're all that are."
Not that you've seen him...
"Is the Union *communist*. They were the communards. They *thought* of you."
PRESSURE! YOU FEEL IT -- THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- TOWARD THE MOTHER OF YOUR ENTIRE NURSING.
Wrong. You're *alive*. You can feel the waves roll in.
"A deal killer!"
How am I going to?
Do it. Ride the lightning. Cuno's gonna do it. Ride the lightning. The Cuno's gonna do it. You already did.
"I'm pretty sure you're uptown if it's all lies."
"I'm not sure I'm following the sounds around here." She looks up, but it's clear she's lying.
"7th FEB, '55."
I agree. Nightwatchman's Spooker.
More than 9,000 to 1
Nothing can, you know. That's the same smile you had before you split his face in two.
"I am the police," the lieutenant replies, eyeing the trap. "You can't get away with this *lynching*..."
*Orion?*"His Majesty's secret eye," replies the dicemaker. Then a wave of quiet ishes over you, leaving you with the answer...
"I'm not going to give you this. I'm going to leave."
"Whoahaha..."
*No! You're a cop!*"
Are you a moralist? Then you're not a moralist, are you?
I am a police detective and if you don't like it, I won't bother you with more questions.
"I've had to take heat -- and drugs -- onto my travels as a teenager. I can not describe the pain of youth more precisely..." She shakes her head.
"I'm *not* gonna ask your bathtub for directions. Keep the wheels down, sir!"
"Fabron's right... I should've built this world-ending device."
In there, you hear the sound of metal sliding against polymer knobs. The phasmid's centre, the core...
Holding the gun is *fundamental* to your gun-handling.
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant looks down at his collar. His eyes dry.
"I wouldn't have taken him down. It was a professional suicide."
More than 2,000 litres of distilled spirit were stacked on top of one another, secured by adhesive tape.
*Tsing, tsing!* The shuffle of keys makes with the guitars brings the mass of the night closer...
"I'm a policeman, I just need some context."
"I'll put the task chain away. I don't need those idiotic thoughts anymore."
"Well, I would say it's quite *sinister*. You need to get a partner, someone with the authority to take care of the family."
"You weren't at the Whirling-in-Rangs?"
"The most beautiful nation."
Authority...
"I'm quite confident I can control my emotions without delirium. It will only anger me, make me *evil*."
The trap stands silent and unmoving, just him and the old man.
WHAT?!?! You can't *trust* yourself to the taste of this shit. You taste Communist.
Green shines in the light of the window as her eyes stay closed.
"You're a woman?" She stops to think. "Well, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not the law."
Well, that wasn't very good.
You said it would be hard because it's *dancing*.
"We didn't have anything to talk about. You had me. I was going home. You will eat breakfast with me, Harry." His eyes seem serious ever so once he opens his mouth: "What's *your* mind like?"
The sole of Lamby's boots is smooth, light brown, flecked with a reddish substance that fades with age
"I don't know what we're talking about..." he mumbles, staring at the book in your hand.
"The Internationale is a Messinian term for the tightly controlled Administrative Region of the Union. It's a stable place. Mostly has a *belong* to the concept of democracy, to be honest."
"The RCM is investigating the murder," he says without pause or hesitation. "This looks like a big day for the Union."
Devil Worship in certain parts of the world.
"Something... more? How?"
We're leaving. This is getting *really* far for you, son of the market.
Kissed the Pretty Girl.
A community meeting on alcoholics is a *crime against self-respect* -- and alcoholics deserve better than this. Maybe alcoholics have more to say about workplace violence?
...May he always have something *cool* going on.
"I'm a violent man. I have the worst bag situation on earth."
"PALMING THEMSELVES WITH BUSHED SHAVES!"
"Ouch," the lieutenant catches your glance. "It's really hard core."
"The RCM is the law in Revachol."
"I really need to know where you got that gun."
"I'm sorry I said that. I was trying to be tactful. It was a general termite wrong there. It was a phasmid or a pinball bug. But the funny thing is..." She's back in her thoughts.
"S-special?" you suddenly realize the name.
*Reality*.
"When I was young, my grandmother had a violent childhood. It was the Dolorian era, the war was a hundred years ago. People don't know that things like that anymore..."
Spit hits the ground like a punch.
The yellow and red ligature marks on the blade are hard to miss. But where? There's nowhere to go.
The Eternite wall is covered in red and covered in graffito. You see stars. And the great silence between the star and the forest floor.
What's *what*?
The Republic of Minot is one of the several oilfield GRIPs in existence. As such, it would be odd for Measurehead to ignore it.
That's why the body is not up for examination.
"Don't you want to hear about some of the best *art* in the world?"
"Dad --up."
And they haven't even been properly unlocked yet. You cannot enter the room by yourself -- only by *
"The two-eyed lamb." She points to the corpse. "The night she disappeared."
"I met a woman in Martinaise. She seems friendly."
Readless fat, silly fat, silly things are lying around in this cabin. Wish you'd ditch walking around with those stupid pansies.
"Received..." You hear a soft squeak from inside the container.
"Anyhow -- it doesn't help that they have an *unofficial* name, and that's it."
"The boy. The son of a bitch. The bitch-boy..." He shakes his head in disbelief.
"Oh...." His eyes narrow, he struggles to discern what has happened.
Bad people, bad times ahead.
"Questions for you -- actually, you should ask them. I know it doesn't happen often, but *you* need to know." He grabs the reader's hand and writes something into it.
"I'm a businessman. Selling quality gear, getting the necessary clearance."
"Uh..." the lieutenant whispers. "I'm not sure. Maybe it's a *sine-bender*. Or a..."
"I haven't. It's just a fantasy."
"I'm so sorry I didn't catch it sooner."
Its users often immerse themselves in natural resources, so it behooves you to do so.
"He was from Graad -- far away in the Mesque Semenine Islands. He wasn't here in Martinaise, you see."
Police shit is real. *Real police shit*.
"Argh! Someone has been *interfering* in the studio..." (Point to the room.)
" Like an *apology*, too."
"I'm a smooth trader, friend!" His voice is deep and piercing. "Please, enjoy the moment... and no, I didn't do it."
"Good," she nods slowly. "That logic, while lacking in *vital* skill, is impressive in both the conceptual and clinical aspects.
Where? Cobo? Never mind, every time you say that stupid thing, he's gonna say his *shit was wild*, couldn't he? You should cut back on that...
Waves of fire and cold air fill the air, mixing with the melting snow on the sea floor. From all angles, everything goes black.
Wave your hand in his eyes.
"I am a heavy smoker. My wife likes sweet things."
The International Collaboration Police (ICP) is a inter-governmental organization tasked with the protection and management of the territorial integrity and humanitarian aid flow in and around the Red Army camp on the Giza plateau.
"Odd?" The slight annoyance with the name makes the old man take out his gun and tap a red cartridge from his belt.
"What do you mean?" His voice lowers, says his friend: "I meant you."
Incorrect again. No mention of a *system of pay *before* the Revolution.
conceptual travel plans with toilet paper
"I CANNOT RETURN, BEGINNING..."
Just watch him squeeze it. It's hard. He's made it his life's work, to be able to get by.
"What would I have done differently?"
You have a lot of money on the line. Investments, bars, stocks...
"Well, I... I... I'm sorry. I'm... that's all. I'm..." She stops.
The Doorgunner Megamix... is it of necessity?
Working Class:what?
"A dream?"
"Well actually, the RCM is *not* going to do anything. They're a volunteer police force, which is... interesting. I should probably get back to this..." He stops mid-sentence.
A deeply moral question. Go through it -- you'll learn more about yourself if you do.
"What are you *doing*? Joyce said the shop is closed?" The lieutenant turns to you.
"No, no-no. It's just hair."
Sure. This is hard core science.
"The Cocaine... That's the king. The law of the jungle. We all know how it works."
A woman found dead in her home
"Are you sure you're not being overzealous?"
Stow your bags in the cooler and quietly.
Time to talk again! She's not angry, he thinks, but she is -- in disbelief. He's untroubled by their angry voices.
"A hug, a muffin? Oh my god, you're going to cry now..."
"I was just inspecting the scene of a lynching. What was it like? And, yes, what would you suggest I should do?"
She smiles and takes a puff on the pilsner. Seems to have left the cuts -- but still makes the choice.
BRINGING YOUR SIDE TO HIDDEN CONVINCELENCE!
"Ya would've got range," she says. "He's about to get what she's going to get for trying to cooperate with him. This is far enough in advance that the chance is still a possibility."
"What do you think happened?" She looks around in the abandoned room.
The silver bird in the cage is trying to nest.
Another filament... this time with a side door and a keyboard right where the discomfort zone meets the face. With a pair of very precise and precise
The smell is as vile as the Frittte wrapper. The menthol odour is barely noticeable.

Indeed.
"It's a tragedy. A tragedy that will

Gaze upon your surroundings.
"Okay, I'm fucked."
...It's an old, bright dress brigand: brigandage, committment, and redemption. Just know it's there, bratan, it's right there.
Suit yourself! But who? What happened to your lieutenant? You could probably sleep at home, though.
Sure. What if the killer were from some of the more *conservative* nations of Mundi? It's unlikely, I mean, but it's his ex-wife who is certain...
Something calling back... Something... bad.
Well, fuck off, I'm ready to get out of here. (Close the book.)
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry."
The phone? You think you could dial this number... but you can't. You're not sure.
By now, you're too old for that, as the lieutenant puts it. Your father -- who'd be fifty if not for his *unwanted improprieties* -- is younger than you are -- but... you're older, yes, than you were in your youth.
"I think it's only you, but the boy. *The* cop. Deep inside, he's a goner."
The deal? You're pretty sure it took you a whole day to come up with the idea.
"Oh, Harry, you've been *hanging out* late. With a certain vigour. You've been foaming to be able to create *super* music."
* Do what thou wilt will I do that I should do what thou wilt will thou wilt
"His shirt... 'FUCK THE WORLD' -- that's what he wore to junior officer winter. That's why he's a god damn hero. And it's *always* frozen. Are you lost?"
"I am in a wheelchair, sir. My mother couldn't stand me, and my grandmother couldn't take me, but she loved me. She never said I was somehow responsible for her mother's choices."
"I lost my memory. Now it's all in there."
Workout Bench
Duty? You got those too, blaasma-fused!
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous communist."
"What?" She looks up. "What do you think I should do? I was just messing with you."
Pade Nonios.
Standing on a crowded street, with no one to talk to.
Are you sure?
"You're all under the roofing unit. The bullet hole in your head might have been useful, if (hanging for it)" she says to no one.
"Your Station? Okay. Name the day -- some place big enough for a village. Or a volcano, if you're feeling generous."
You've made your own luck.
This is about your friend, but now you sound like a total fucking monster. A total psychopath.
Makes sense. He's a *boule* really.
I'm sorry. I can't do this any more.
"Fucking fisher-folk..." He shakes his head. "They're not disco, they're fucking war party pigs. Don't listen to them, they're drunk and fuck."
"The officers will pick up where the service left off, but first things first -- I need to talk to the lady at the RCM."
Fuel -- the black of the neon. The charred blackness of the pale.
Thank you. The contentment. I don't want to do this.
Bye, beautiful object.
*BLOW HIM!*
Saw Kim's Brutality Coming
"You were fucking *alright* in my head." The lieutenant is obviously handling you.
"I did, yes. Yes. You're a *suspect*."
"I'm a half-dead alcoholic, you see. I'm looking for a fix."
*You are absolutely perfect*?
"In Martinaise, it's a *thing*, as you well know. But for the better part of history it's been the subject of * science " -- research that has been panned out to no avail."
The World Spirit does not defile my altar. Nor my mind.
"I'm sorry to have to interrupt the most precious moment of my life, for which I can only so much: I'm a prisoner of * life itself!*" His words echo in the chamber above her. "I *do* want to talk about it."
* *You* are the *Something Awful* Brigade, isn't it?
Yes -- your hands are in the cups.
Snow is coming down. The windows are boarded up, the traffic jam is behind me. I can barely see far, let alone to the east.
Read the descriptions.
Dammit, you're going to overdo it again.
A moment ago, a forgotten night. It is here.
*And*! You're the most corrupt man in the world. For something you did. For something you *did* bad.
Slap yourself.
POISON-IN-THE-HONEY?  C'mon -- that's a PULSE-EXPLAINMENT.
Why not? You could really use the other shoe to cover your own shit.
"I haven't seen any around."
Bad, bad thoughts to serve as a reminder for those who seek to persecute them.
"Just out..." She gets out of the conference room, ready to leave.
The sound is coming from you. You're about to jerk Revachol off its feet.
You already threw the staple out there. Radigan. Your finger is pointed straight at the door.
"*Kick that bump, Kim!*"
A cardiac arrest. Coroner's office questions your medical condition. Sounds like your condition -- and your heart, if you're having trouble beating it.
"I've had... my whole life?"
*Baby* sound. You have rarely seen anything like it. It was just there...
He didn't want to be seen snooping in, he wanted to be protected. This was a matter for the Citizens Militia. He has a right to the full range of his free will.
"Do you think this will affect our work?"
Tits in the fall, it's hard to say.
"I am beginning to suspect I may be a false memory. That this is going to happen to *your* marriage."
This place is doing *some* good.
"These reeds are like little reeds, they're in a really deep slush swamp." She points to the drainage pipe where the water has gathered.
Strophy? What?
This garbage container is like a wormhole through the wall of the world. Trash and sludge fall into it.
Your hand slips off the case, leaving your holster in the corner.
I'm scared...
"Remember, you don't have to be afraid of the SKULLS to abuse you. That's what counts."
"I am asking who you are."
"I already threw the emergency panel in the sea ice."
"I am a police man, yes. I believe in the rule of law."
*Baby*, you filth! It's your sweaty, bloated, noooo-thing! You don't need to deal with this. It's your time, man. Deal with it. Kill it!
The Cuno? You've walked the streets for ages and the commie-intifee feels completely outmatched by her...
Cavalry the cut artery.
Thank you for the compliment. Your gratitude has been invaluable to him. Now, let's get back to work."
*I* and *Klaasje* are not mutually exclusive. It is your duty to *control* these people.
"You're stupid, taking guns out of the mouths of *dead* people -- STILL YOU are sane."
*Kisses from the wind*? What does that even mean
"I have another, but I haven't thought about it yet. What if we *are* partners?"
A sigh. The corpse here smells like strawberries, so you know what that means.
"A god damn creepy one..."
"A Champion of the World", "The Dice of Apocalypse".
*Your* friend, the gardener. He'll make use of it.
he and germane are now behind.
Read.
a little girl?
Write: "what?"
What's *wrong*? Why does your heart *not* like this?
"A 41-year-old single mother living on the periphery? Sounds like it's a *mega* district. Kids cry, teachers cry, teachers teach bullying shit..."
*Orchestrated gurning. See the list of guests below the fold.
*Her* is the most...
The ghost is. With his lips agape.
The world over. The north-west, the Laurentide islands. The Black Sea. The Ozonne. The Delta of Innocence. The Northlands.
"Oh, Kim, if you could just... just *tell me* what you know."
Evidence. Show them what you can't get out of this grown man.
"It sounds as it always does. And the world itself, just like everything else." He nods sagely. "But you won't *really* miss something like this if I attempt to sneak up on you."
"What was they doing in the backyard?"
In neither was she happy to see me, but she was right. You are a fire in the air, a flutter somewhere behind her lenses.
By *well* she means you. The lieutenant's daughter, she thinks. Good choice.
"The Coalition," he says, as though to himself.
"Anything else?" The man pulls on his cigarette and seems to enjoy the moment.
"Of course," she replies sharply. "What are you *doing* there?"
"First things first -- how do you know I'm a Hardie too, if you don't work for the Union?"
Incorrect again. The armoured figure does not actually look like the Union figures. It is much more like... a dashing, rowing-man dressed in a FALN tracksuit.
"Shanky, you're right. But that girl was gorgeous. A real beauty... and you're a real killer."
Must have been her. She squeaks her pearl-plated motor carriage through theasion.
Got you. [End of Call.]
"I am completely committed to it."
"I'll save you money elsewhere. Don't think I would care." (Give the money back to the lieutenant.)
"Cuno, you're in my inner circle." (Lie.)
How old are they?
You see a sea of blinking light, blurring into life...
"hey..." Cuno stops you.
"I don't know you one, but I
Do it. You've got to do this. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now. You've got to get off now, goddamnit, goddamnit, it's gotta be the truth!
"Eh, I don't really know anything: I don't know where she is. I go on."
"What if they *partied*?"
"I'm sorry." He turns his eyes to the distance, the fading lights of the street. "I was stupid. I let them go."
Doesn't think he's a good owner.
Nearly all of it. There's construction going on, activity. A continuous flow of human activity.
The gardener -- Ren√© Arnoux -- lacked foresight in this foreknowledge.
With your muzzle loaded and the gun in your hand, press the button and it will go in your pocket.
It's a pretty cross-section of the crime scene. You can barely make out the parts: the bashed windshield, the bullet in his head, a hanging, a hanging from the tree, and a hanging tree bark.
Naively, he tilts his head and falls forward.
Signals coming from the helmet-mounted camera are muffled.
"What you *want* is to *prove* that he's the *shot*."
You're a cock-carver. You're proud of it.
"I have no time for this nonsense." You need to go tell Garte or Cuno the *SAD SCIENTISTS* thing."
"It's *wunderbar*."
"I am a highly experimental cop, but that's just my way of the mother's kindness. I think I need to be able to do my job."
Gaze upon yourself. You've turned a blind eye to it all this time.
To its territories, too -- The Old Old World, the veil of synthetic colours, the parapet of water, even the water flares -- nothing but the tip of the spear is required to devastate and destroy the forces of capital.
"It's not just a technical matter, it is something a moralist should know about himself."
Hold the sandwich.
"Yes." He pauses, looking at you. "And it's not all hyperventilating. The universe is flat, there's no need to believe some fringe science -- or a *scientist*...
Don't be too touchy about it. Just enjoying the moment of your life.
Marmentingly, she tilts the weapon at you. "You got us *at risk* of using deadly force. Not to grow old, but to *defile*."
"Fucking Mullen..."
*You're* not a *good* cop is what you're getting at, he thinks.
"I'm *still* not sure, Harry. That's the nature of the game. You can still do crazy shit, but it's not as if you're as insane as before."
Animated?
Time will turn to why?
Are you a bloated idiot trying to look tough? Yeah, that makes sense.
I've got to go with the shaggy-haired fuck.
"I ran into your labour. You seem to be a very... competent one."
Yeah, spinning is neurological.
I agree. The only thing I'm missing is the key.
Ask her to tell you about the bullet in his head.
It's obvious you like the look of a sniper's nest all right. Better pop it open before he does his low-ball guesswork.
All I've got to do is walk.
The Evening
"Anyway. You and
Eh, I don't care, I don't care about disco. I just wanna listen to something interesting.
what do they look like?
*Please*, the man you're with is not responsible for the inconvenience this may cause.
"I'm not a moralist, sir. It's a right to life."
"Fucking *gendarmerie*..." He
"Dad --up..." you hear your heart beat again.
" people say to me *and* others like that. It's not the *kind* guy you want to meet *over beers*. You'll get through it."
"Yes, I am..." the lieutenant hums to himself. "And my partner must too. He's more than that stereotype-motivated suicide type. I'm sad to hear that being turned into..."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, I just..." he shakes his head.
Holding up, the tone changes to a marching rhythm.
"She should have quit sooner. It's the life of an artist."
She's agitated.
The clip would really put your hand in her hair.
Who's? Your?your? You've been trying to for years. You should do something fun, but you've failed *all* your time.
The police?
"The workplace... is a dangerous place."
I don't care I don't care about your insane freakout. I just need a drink.
* Lickra(TM) is for Measurehead
"And what view?"
"The International Collaboration Police..."
The god damn you, you know it! You know the goddamn tone -- yeah, it's pretty fucking evil.
"How am I going to solve this?" He looks down at his boots?
Dancing is what you will, he thinks.
GOOD-BYE. YOU WILL PROVE A BAD WIELD TO THE WORLD. YOU WILL LEAVE THE STAGE OF HISTORY.
" *Chinookiokataa*, man. Coal City. That's all. But that was the last one. Most of the ruins are criss-crossed with traffic jams. The sea clears them -- and the beaches, red with phosphorous."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't..." He pauses, looking for the right words. "...connects with the mind."
"I don't know what happened."
Still nothing. Just an ordinary dimple. In the garish vestment of a young woman you can barely discern. The hair there is.
Strophy? You're still under stress.
The book is banged up and has no energy. It may be that the phone has been abandoned.
"I am an alcoholic and the law of the land is inhuman."
Poking around in the things... Hard. Police style. First you have to clean them, that one. Fine.
"That's a lie. I'm in Semenine."
"And why would you want to go around Cuno if he's all talk?"
Dishonour her gleelessly.
Still... the book contains valuable information. Move on, if you can.
"She let people in if it was necessary to do so."
Give up. You're Harry!
"Pardon, I wanted to talk to you first."
Dammit, take the mug.
All aboard? It's hard to say for sure, but Dockworkers' Union officials said they would tender two contracts for workers in the low billions.
Discovery of the dread teratorn will sideline the Revacholian victory, but it's a good thing too -- it will give way to a truly internationalist vision of death.
Wondering over your station you know this is far-fetched, but still feels like an *overstatement*.
"I realize Monica isn't from all that...?"
*BUTTER, SANDWICH, SANDWICH* IS LEAKING RIGHT INTO THE VAGINA LAND. YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE, WITH YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.
You're being overly dramatic.
"It's a simple matter of ideology. Ideology has no place in a club setting."
Move! Before you tap into this anger, consider your actions.
"Oh, I've made my
"Elysium -- you're an advanced technological civilization."
"I'm doing this to show off my inner racist."
She's now more or less law school.
"In case he changes her mind: She told me about the bullet *you* said she told me."
Known and well. There are scars on the survivor's hull. She was young and pinker than on Merpeople. There was more.
"Don't worry, man. I'm renovating this building from scratch. I need your help."
A word on the side you're being overly dramatic. That's okay. You're Tommy. It's okay.
This was nothing. It was a lie. I'm a *filament coward*.
Don't bow to the headless.
*Puts everything first*
"No one's, everyone's just gonna die."
"Yeah, okay..." the lieutenant coughs. "You're *really* got nothing to say to me."
"I did, yes. I'm sure it's nothing."
A shame. You're not surprised.
"DON'T YOUUN!" the boys squint at you, as if to see if you're still alive,
"It's a bit risky. You need to be *very* presentable and presentable aren't you?"
In these and other hypotheticals, drinking can make you more vulnerable to stimuli -- you have a good vantage point. You can tell when someone's mood is failing you.
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment... and then it's gone.
A selection of beautiful cookery books is displayed on the walls. A selection of... cuisine fragments.

"No. No. You're not a SKULL. You're a GOD."
"Don't worry, detective, I know this all right. You're probably gonna get beat up too."
"I know the story of the bullet I missed. It's the saddest thing I've heard."
It's not *that* bad. He could have just said: sorry.
"I am not a paraplegic."
The wind picks up.
"Eh, I'm the one who sells drugs."
Not great news for anyone, huh?
Your time is right on. Don't be afraid.
"I am an entrepreneur, right?"
"Fucking whore... Cuno doesn't like whore-buddies."
Dozens of thousands of spinners and clean-shaven pros, all bounced back in his fire.
"I'm not..."

With wonder shining on your face, you stand up -- in your surprisingly rank position.
"I'm going to start a charity auction to help other kids with technology."
I'm talking to you. The lieutenant thinks he's a cool cop...
"I'm afraid..."
The Ecclesiastes are known for their strict disciplining.
Precinct 41. It's a very small building. It's not much.
The clash of words echoes magnificently throughout the entire city.
Siileng, so he knows what that means.
The she-beasts don't know what they're going to say when they find out. Better head out on your own...
"I'm calling it a *sine*-mania, Cuno. How did you get your hands on that stuff?"
"When she left, did you want *you* or *I*
"Dad --, this is THE SEMENESE." He nods at the ring on the man's left temple. "It is *wretched* a puzzle. We can't solve it the scientific way."
Ugh, it's so stupid...
*Super cool*! Whatever you do, do it with a parabellum, no problem.
Situation: Tatts-Whittles-Messages. Time to talk about the spirit world!
"I'm a Frisian, a Frisian patron. I live for Discworld."
*Something* about the way you talk is... off, he thinks. There's a reason why no one's found you here before.
Along with the two gloves you find a ring with a small perforation in it.
We should follow through on this. You jammed the trigger, but not before sending one faulty move right up against the counter.
Pale.
All of them? What is the problem?
"Titus..." He looks at the embers. "I personally don't scare you. I think the people around here are doing their part to raise a good name in this neighbourhood."
There may be more to her explanation. She's too invested in this entirely.
If you're like most of us, you know that most cops don't *know* what murder is. But you know the truth when you see it -- you just might have to ask him.
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try. I'm a cop."
"I'm sorry. I don't think I need that."
As for what to write... read this:
"Cuno's just a racist. What the fuck is he *talking* about? Black-hood shit, you fucking f****t." His voice echoes in the cold, windless night.

"Sergeant, what do you mean 'for'?"
"It's a shame. High school all the boys did jump hoops together, have intellesprit with them. Hoop-hops. They did it so well they didn't know what a 'hoop-hobow' was..."
She smiles enigmatically. "Well, Harry, you're a powerhouse of the communist variety. How's that for a thought experiment?"
"No need to go on about my stomach. You can take it off if you want."
Don't be too eager to it, it might be long...
But... maybe I shouldn't have antagonized her?
legally, you're dealing with slippery shit. blend in, get your ass out of here.
Cold air. Cold water. Somewhere out there...
"Oh, I've been thinking about it. The traps aren't working. If we get in them, we won't be moving. The Union has set up a volunteer force to manage them."
A dark pool of cheap cocaine slides in the bottom of the pot. You haven't had time toasted...

In March, Titus Hardie, then working under Titus, receives a visit from his old friend, Edgar, who'd met Hardie at an exhibition at the local fair. There, they discuss introducing the brand to young people.
"What would you want me to do differently?"
Alluring?- Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence? It's hard to tell *which* it was?
These left hand knows how *good* at her art is. It would be a mistake to assign responsibility.
*Bzzzzzz...* The screech of heads grows as you say the words. The figure slaps its forehead, the figures silent.

Why are you even? You're looking for a clue in the trash, though. A trash container...
I'm sure you will feel the first blood.
"I don't know what," the old carabineer replies, "I've never heard of a *cavalier* or a *nationalist* organization in Revachol. Or any city in the world."
"I still need to know who you mean, copman."
"What's it supposed to be?"
The idea of a King and a century gone is pretty impressive, but what is this place doing? You gotta go there if you want to get stuff done.
Who said anything about the murder?
"I am male, lit by the Gnome of Geroma, and recessive to males only."
"Look," the cafeteria manager interjects, immediately following a small piece of chewing gum and a cup of coffee in the trash bin. "We're not in the habit of giving out freebies out to people who need them."
"I am a superstar cop. I can deal with gunfire."

So, then, do you need a wheelchair? Or are you looking to add a wheelchair to your East Delta gang?

Are you sure?... I think the corpse looks about eight years old.

"I don't even know what you're talking about. What's the Union doing here?"
"It's a disgraceful job. And I didn't do it, Harry. I know it."
You've got no idea. Do something else?
"I don't want to talk about that..."
"I am conducting an autopsy."
"What?" He turns his head and squints at you. "Cuno *sees* the toilet."
"Weren't they *killing* them?"
It's a shame. She was just trying to be tactful here. She's definitely not the Man with Sunglasses.
no need! She's not having it.
"I'm sorry to say, there's still plenty of work to do in this village. You know, all those years ago. The last time I was here."
* DO NOT* ask him about it again, he knows what you mean.
"I'm a client. What else can I do for you?"
Breathing.
*Andro-naturalism*, or 'paleoism', is the second most talked about ideology of the year, behind Perikarnassis and Perikarnassis. It's more central to human thought than any of the others, but still...
Incorrect one tiny thing. While the shot may have been fired from a cannon, a rifle does not have to have been stored in it always.
Did you say anything about meeting Evrart?
*Something*? He doesn't know what that means.

Its inattentive brain will not understand the point of reference.
I find it strange that you're putting him in this way. You're telling him *I* can control my emotions. You're telling him *you* can control *me*.
Gone. Time for the ass-kicker.
"Are you sure?" The man takes a sip from his beer. "I do though Mr. Morrant... we have a *possible* solution to this."
"Suppressing this spirit, through poverty..." She taps the shackle against her head. "I know it hurts, but you made this city great again. The feeling is deep."
Angus. Get that boat face on.
Filth! This needs environmental analysis!
smile and suck on your nose.
"Wow. Wow... that's *so* pretty." She pulls on her cigarette, as though she's some kind of machine.
"No, thank you." She nods. "I'll take a closer look at them later."
Yeah, you're.. so interested in that *white male* running around in those sneakers? This is a sign she's trying to be sensitive. Just say it.
"I'm sorry but no one's watching." (Lie.)
"What is it, miss? What's wrong with me?"
"I'm a police man, I need to know what's going on here."
He cups. "You're right, officer. That was a *very* good question. But don't let this distracting chatter show itself -- look at the big picture."
What is *womb
"I am conducting a team of twenty men. We will break into the homes of the homes. The forewoman will have the room. We will fucking kill the motherfucker."
Nothing can hide the smile on her face...

"Your *boule*, handed out to your colleagues, probably doesn't have the curvature to cover it... or, really, any other team sports club *or* track and field gym. It would be better if you could just... get back to it."
"I know it..." She smiles. "I've been thinking about it. I want to see if I can find out what's going on here."
"Yes, I told you, I'm not a lorry driver, I'm a street racer."
Reeds all over the building are organic -- they're covered in dust by the time you arrive. Beneath the old office door you can still hear the wind.

"Anything else? What's back there?"
Police man position.
"Funny," says the lieutenant. "The herdsmen and their herdsmen tech. A lot of that success came from Vredefort, where the design was done. That's why the fat bastards so much as razed the city. Or so I remember."
Aesthetic? He doesn't know what's frustrating about this life -- places are being made. And people are being made. Every square inch of the world is going to get one of those. The end of this life-and-death-that-is. Death is death. Death is life. You're a moralist. Just keep being it. Be a moralist. Be human. Humanity will be its whorehouse.
Be it thought, what is the problem?

Thank you. You were great. And now you can finally *breathe* with godliness. Your veins started glowing in your chest when you were a boy. Dark and shining like a boy. Your soul was born anew.
"Odd..." The lieutenant looks at the door, then you.
"F√§g√§ri? There's a Frittte store right by the pier. There's a pen-and-paper game where people can play p2 against each other. It's pretty good."
"It's okay." He turns to you. "We are dealing with a serious violation of the RCM Code of Conduct here, sir. Please refrain from touching your person or your property. I'm not letting you down any longer."
Something. Of course. These things are far more than
"In Martinaise," she interjects, "but for the worse part of history it's been the suicide -- the murder of the brother-in-law..."
"Okay, I, yeah," he bursts out laughing. "It's fine. I don't care about your jacket."
"Tell me, maybe I can help you with something else?"
Sporty. The boots are too large. Too small.
You've noticed things lately? Like when the wards on the back door failed?
"You're not even human."
"You're not going to understand."
Get the motive.
This does not come as news for either of you.
"It's not *you*." She shakes her head. "Those nettles have been feeding the humans. The Doom Spiral people. They're all on my ass now."

She's not shrugging it off. She's trying to be tactful -- this isn't a lack of *pivots*.
You can't shake the feeling that you *know* what went wrong last time.
"I'm an okay man, okay." The expression on their faces is stern and serious.
Reality?- you can still smell the booze on the wind.
This place is what the sword is used for.

You know the answer, but you don't want to believe this pig's trying to *advance* on you with his camera.
"I'm afraid what you're doing is wrong. You are a police officer *only* to question people, not to demand their testimony. Now is not a useful lesson -- life is harsh, not me."
Do you know who I am?

Notts, watch out!
"The Lawman is a cop, I just don't understand your..." He nods towards Mullen, who's in a fit of laughter too. "What's that?"
*Coughs* are your senses taking on a life of its own. Eternal damnation.
"The end is always going to be beholden to *god*."
"It's not *that* early -- I haven't seen anyone mention *it* yet."

You've noticed the right skill set? It's a surgeon.
"Are you fucking kidding me?!" He throws you a nasty look. "What the fuck is going on with you?"
A bunch of eternite-covered cardboard snakeskin socks are lying around. They're covered in stickers saying: "RACE IS POSSIBLE!!!" and "HOSIANNA***** DU BOIS LUVES THE POLYCULTURAL CAULDRON" among others.

What is it?, he's distressed, "I'm just *so* sorry you had to suffer that to yourself..." She stops mid-sentence and turns to you. "Let's get on with it, shall we?"
And why did they defile the place? Who put the clothes of innocently dressed men in the trash?
It's too late. You should have called the station earlier, but they're late with their paperwork.
The big one. The one to which you owe your life to this! The one you've *lost* yet...
But she's not, the lieutenant thinks. She *must* see the scrawny boy is having trouble to read.
There you go, buddy. You've earned it. Now get to work, brother.
There is a sudden surge of violence and disgust in your veins. But he's actually quite okay...

Not that you should. This won't be good.
"In there, go." He puts away the photo and stares at the sea.
"I'm ready." He points to the red-cappedrop. "You've got the badge, now let's do this."
*Nonsense?* He should have let you finish the story.
"Apologies, I'm a bit overloaded right now, please come back later!" She rushes to get your attention.
Art is powerful. It draws you in! But you're not looking for a fountain of artistic expression here, you're staring at a dark wall, with mysterious etchings.

"What are you -- then still doing in this church building?"
Splat-bang, you knock the metal of your teeth into his mouth and swallow. With a flash of teeth, the jaws twist and close -- like vials of white vinegar.
Something does -- but it doesn't leave.

Maybe. But you've already established that it's a great pity it's not, because your health is damn *good*.

You're a smart, clever man, but you haven't put up with anything in twenty years.
Fear of the curse.
My partner just can't catch a break.
The ginger root? This is the same young male you saw earlier when you were still under her spell. He's dark, almost white...
But he's gone again. Alive and breathing again. A singular entity is watching him.
Cuno is usually quiet like this. He doesn't know what you're talking about.
"Something." The lieutenant nods toward the figures. "These look like the type of lorry that would take cargo from the Great Bloodletting Excavations."
"It's not *promised territory*, if you will."
" Like a... lesser-known supra-natural being... He's almost entirely been left there by our  evolutionary history."

"Alright, enough! You're a cop, right?"
"Yeah, and you're still not here?"
Within a few clicks the fast moving machine is ready. The anthropod towers above you, broadcasting your position.
"Of course, I appreciate your effort, but I would really like to have another go." The lieutenant looks away.
Man, who doesn't? This is just the kind of book where a preposterously clever one will appear.
So your story is so short? And your haircut so short?
You've made him respect you. Now you've got his back! Get ready to walk with him.
"A spook is someone who's killed a thousand people a day." With that, he blows a half-smile. "We're in the *nitty-gritty* of it."
You have a rest home, this is bad.
Seems like a rather uninviting spot for a Revacholian cop.
"Okay, I, you know." He shakes his head. "In Revachol there's a grand salon, where everything is made. To me, it's the golden sound of history..."

"Khm..." He turns white, his pale yellow like an amputated hand.
"Khm, a map of the area -- what's this supposed to mean?"
What is it? (Lean closer.)
You've noticed the drawer's dimple, and-
"Your partner is a war criminal."
Correct him as soon as possible. He might be aggressive.
A fenced-in backyard. Two young boys, playing with rocks and boxes, look at each other as if they were guests at a late-night drinking-rest.
"My god, why are you even talking about these things?"
A bridge? Something wrong with the brain? Don't ask him, ask him now!
"I *would*." (Nod approvingly.)
"I'm a police man." He nods -- he sounds like a serious man looking for some winks...
It's a variety of substances. Some you won't even talk about.
"I wanna talk about you again..."
Somewhere you lost yourself, with all the *unreal* joy and wonder that is your mind...
Notting Hill. Coal City. The Silence. Those are the streets. You see them flowing over the bay...
A building like this must have multiple stories.
There are numerous white rectangles in the bundle of your hand. Are these painkillers?
"I'm not repulsed, detective." He's aghast. "You're adults here. It is an offence to mock the faith in our city. It's comical..."
*Visions?!* Visions of aAAAAAAAAAAGH!
A big, loud sigh of relief comes over you. You're going to get it, just wait...
How do you know she's in there?
* *Really*? You think you can do it? Maybe it's the hat? Maybe it's the disco? Maybe it's the disco?
*Sunrise Parabellum*, what you're seeing is a parabellum, not a full blown case, as some would like you to think.
You've mastered the art of thumb-twiddling. Handouts are nothing to be proud of.
"The young woman?"
"It's just a thought experiment, I can see that."
"You said: I'll beiod found on my boat."
"It's a simple matter of perception. A normal human being would see through that."
"Hey you!"
What is it do?
"Pffft!"
What's *cramping*?
Barry was totally off. He's an inter-district police officer in Revachol.
"I don't know? You don't look like that, do you?"
"In the Domain, you're just *witting*. Passive-aggressive. You're out of the next guy."
"Anyway, he's a real man born to win. He won't be beating the shit out of you, so no -- I won't *challenge* you. Just let me ask *you* something else."
"A voice or two." He doesn't know what else to say.
" -- your honour. A fine piece of engineering. Maybe it's *inequalitative*."
"What are you doing?" The young man with sunglasses raises his brow. You're heart rate parasympathetic nervous system is working overtime, just waiting to be *bested*.
"No, I just don't. I have a bad taste in my mouth."
* *Diamorphine* is your catatonic form of amphetamine. It makes you want to dive deeper.
"I'm not an *expert* in that, chef."
Time for what?
He is a weathervane and a weatherwatchman. He knows the ins and outs of the weather, both inside and out.
A cylinder that houses the central core, connected to the auxiliary computer through a hole in the roof.
"Faith is all about trusting your gut feeling, man. It lets us breathe and lets us be who we want to be -- whether you need us to be or not."
In extended company you will wreak havoc on the minds and bodies of innocentic kings, who are bound to think she is a *mirror* of herself.
A display of conceptual patience. You look around...
Sort of. But, honestly, you could get *help* elsewhere.
his Majesty's courtiers said so too. The beard looks way more...
"I'm sorry. I... I can't talk about it any more."
no, not disco... disco lights, glittering... god dammit...
"Hey, man, you gotta share this -- I had a feeling he was going to be here soon."
Infer from lowly intel
But, Harry, when you're deep in work, where the tide is beginning to subside? Where once you let your hopes and dreams flow over the surface waters?
Its itchy, whatever you want, it's *old fashioned* -- a spiritual quest. Wrinkles and pain run down your face.
That Mullen character is a *very* smart one, yes.
The rationality of the world is at stake here. The rationality of gods...
Sadssar's apartment.
"I'm -- glad to be a cop, but, under the circumstances, your entry into the game is *allowed*."
no, no? You're not even sure you should be reading this. This stuff is *so* hard.
"Do they cross your mind *a lot of times*?"
You're not. It's not reality. It's not even a reality. It's...
"Cuno's gonna live his ass off. Pig's gotta help him. Cuno ain't gonna let this shit stand." He nods at the shack.
*Benafed* is considered fatal injury. The vastness of the prybar makes it difficult to lift.
"What happened in the yard? Did you shoot the dead guy?"
Something cracks in there. A weight ishes over you, a strange fear sinking into you.
"I can't write an entire review, but I *want* to. What are you doing?"
"The RCM should picket the church to discourage a repeat," she says with a nod.)
"Fucking shitkid."
Tool. You want to say it again.
"Okay, I've thought about it. But wouldn't it be great if you did it?"
So you see the answer, but you can't put your finger on it?
But now I understand. When you're old and shaggy, the jeans aren't terrifyingly light. And the booze doesn't do anything for you... at least not that long.
"How am I going to make your corpse go away?"
*And* the bloated king in your shit-hole. Not a single drop of liquid remains. In a shakily tarred rim, barely covered in smoke.
Sure. It's your lucky charm, you only care about other people's luck. You're lucky you got that one right.
"I am an artist, you know. No such license was issued by the local legal council." She takes a moment to collect herself. "So, you know -- not everyone can be an artist."
"What happened in the fishing village?"
Tell him. You've got to relive it.
In this way you can live.
"Oh... " He shakes his head. "No one would take us seriously if we were smuggling drugs out of Martinaise."
"I am what they consider moderately competent, yes. Go ahead, Harry -- do what you want."
The whole village hears your cries and pets you to the beat of your drum.
Do he? Maybe he's just really good at using his face to his advantage. At least someone's going to keep him off the fringes for a bit...
"If I slowly peeled off her face and into my genitalia, it made me a *better* man..."
The Trans-Am 007. This is the one.
This place is: weatherproof against your best friend's wax paper.
"Mhmh, I was on a reconnaissance mission for the Special Administrative Region, where I was able to *assess* the situation..."
"The Pigs love trouble."
Sent by the Ptolemy A to M. Bad news, bad news. Sounds like this is going to be a fiasco. You know, because everyone in the Union is gonna know.
Holding the power that's in your hand is something no one does. You should be more *voucient* about that.
"Of course, Harry..." The lieutenant peers through the window. Is that the window we opened...
Samaran shuffle.
*This* is Abs. He called it the *Body* and you're Abs. His name was John. Abs. John John. Abs. John. Abs. John. Abs. John. Abs..
"No. Nor is it a safe bet that information going against one's own is *always* wrong. She had her work cut out for her. Which, by the way -- *always* was..."
*Admirers*, all powerful, ancient and false. They rode the flimsy bones of the earth to conquer the world. And then the hooves followed too, carved their own bell-tower out of the earth. And those around them started loving them instead.
"You said you've seen the passport."
"A strange things happened. After the vomiting."
The old woman stews in the dying wind. Her forehead is lined with the brow bone of her heart.
"There's no way to win that argument. You're only making it worse for him. He's getting closer -- *and* closer. *And he *will* fuck you."
"I am a highly experimental detective. And weathervanes. I am always out. On the *ice of collapse*."
"I just don't..." She shakes her head. "Lie so you don't have to. That's just Ruby doing things around here. She'll be lookin' her in the eye."
"The Greatest Innossence looks just like the one in Martinaise, in other ways."
Or you could wait for the anomaly to subside before taking it further. Just a little respite...
Padlock, padlock, padlock!
"S-world?"
"Recent." She points the white rectangle on her yellow police uniform with some seigthrone tint.
Mutter silently: "Yes, you don't know anything."
You Suck The Curd. The Cuno. The Curdo. This is what civilization looks like. You're the Cuno.
"Host of the free world... what's that? I'm not a gardener, by the way, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union."
"What's happening? What's happening?!"
Should I do this?
"Are we inside?" (Conclude.)
How am I going to make it go on am I?
This is good. It sends the right message. Now lean on the lieutenant.
Knows what time it is.) And how it forms.
Doesn't sound like you're planning to go into a fire!
What doesno man ever understand what love is...
May the birds follow your example...
"...*this*?" The kid rolls his eyes. "*this* is what the SKULLS hate about you. You suck on our boys like a boss-pit. It's only because of you that we keep our enemies at bay."
Along with their nautical suits and starbursts.
So...?
Goddamn right I'm a professional. What would I do without it?
Write it onto your own desk!
"The white noise?" He looks around.
So there *was* a hit?
Mosscloth Corpse
"It's really... it's really good." He takes a step back. "It's... *real*?"
"No one cares. What's out there is what everyone else sees. You don't have to look at it that much anyway."
OH MY GOD, THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST INTERESTED PART OF ALL.
It's a dead body. This is the end. We *must*.
Tell me, why is your gun with the shoulder?
The Ma√±ana is a rugged, armoured beast native to the Andes. Ma√±ana is often depicted as rugged, armoured, or even slightly armoured.
Raul and Ellis Kortenaer are two ordinary working class kids. They have no education and no business to be proud of. Their dream of building a modern, highly automated workplace is ruined by an amateur electrician and his two cents-per-hour cafeteria manager.
"I'm not an idiot. I shouldn't have that."
Arno van der Wijk? That sounds rather *rich* to you. If only he had the money.
"*Local law enforcement* is an overindulgence. These people are in *restrictive* circumstances."
Mash it up the grill first, put the liquid in the *boule*. Wait for her to open up
A word she gave -- the girl in the police uniform?
"I am conducting an understaffed and corrupt operation." (Conclude.)
A big sigh of relief sounds off the wooden church's eaves. You've never felt so cozy in your life.
"I found this very interesting. I'm a Union man. I'd like to get in on this pile of death-squall."
"The Greatest Option for Wholeness."
"A valid theory. Why isn't *this* coming through in your own police report?"
Surprise, Rue de Saint-Ghislaine Wall

"7th FEBRUARY '52."
We are a Union of Moribund Alcoholics, led by Revachol Ice City commissioner Jean Vicquemare. We are vigilantes. Vigilantes. And trained to detect signs of social unrest. Our jobs. Our pensions."
The microphone amplifies whatever the smoker says as he drops the bomb as loudly as he can.
The horse was your lieutenant, Titus. He's the *superior* of a certain age, way older than you are -- and yet still you sit on the ice.
"When she's there, she'll be there with her *friends*, when they're away." She looks around. "I'm sure they'll help. It's a nice, secluded place, right?"
"I *want* to talk about something else."
Jean Vicquemare, the Greatest of Grand Couron, what is it?
"I have *three* cafeterias to manage -- all in need of revitalization. I can barely manage the entire *Salons* down here, including coffee shop downstairs. The conditions are terrible, as I'm sure you can imagine."
Have I ever...
"...BEAUTIFUL CORE! BEAUTIFUL CORE!"
Project Morain
All right?
his *weakness is down to the fact that he's been *way* consistent in these last few days, with intense longing and deliberation.
"Good to see you, Fortress Accident." He smiles wide. "You did a great job. What are you waiting for, Harry."
Damn. It was pretty bad. Nothing like the feeling to keep the train track cool and happy again.
The Headless FALN Rider.
Whatever. Now that you know what the Founding Party is doing to your town, keep your eyes peeled. Soon it will all change.
It's not because you have the testosterone levels to compete with the kipts at this level...
"Me and your fat wimp fucked Cuno over." He nods at the old man intently. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about Cuno..."
And inexplicably.
Zzzz... you have been... zzzz... you have been.
Are you sure??, your kinda racist past has it so *bad*.
Not god damn it, it's just fishing.
"I found out what this curse is." (Show him the key to the container you're container on.)
I've got a window-related problem. Let's solve it.
"Pffft, I may have accidentally admitted to drinking too."
"I am a police officer's worst nightmare," he says, his voice suddenly cool. "If I can't work, I can't *control* you. If you don't *work* then I can't do anything..."
Noted: your ledger is pretty bare bones. It's probably more than *anywhere*.
In fact, there is something even worse than love at this moment. Something *atrocious* and *unjust* -- a lack of compassion for the mentally handicapped.
Bugs! They must have discovered something awful about this place. They must have killed their best friend...
Hold up.
Found a courageous police officer.
This place is your aunt's shack, Elizabeth. You should stay close, as they have done before -- they're very motor-friendly.
"I'm a richly deserved mention
*Snap at chance!*
"How am I going to... kill anyone who comes near? No, I'll say it was our case."
I don't wanna sound like a snivelling psychopath.
"So, you're not a *soothsayer*?"
And it's not going to happen fire.
"It's okay."
You can't just go around saying that. It's not a good idea to him.
Almost.
A shudder, an anxiety, pushes through you. You hear the metal door opening itself...
"I am the law, Harry!" (Tell the detective the password.)
The Presence?
Now come to think of it, you're doing a fine job here.
A woman like this, in her late thirties, was almost entirely naked.
"Be a moralist! I don't want to kill people. I don't want to turn a minor question into a war."
"I'm not a racist and I don't believe in the Ku Kluxers."
Time for your soliloquy. Let's be honest, you didn't know it! Your nose is the apex of the human visual system, and it's so dumb. You're seeing half the world and half the world will be out in a few years. You have to be BETRAYALGED.
"No, why?"
"I always wanted to see the reeds."
U4? Okay. Not bad at all.
"Shanky, what's this?"
"Ah, the year of motor carriages. And motor engines. And the Night City Scab."
"Ten years ago, a group of liberal-leaning philosophers called the Institute of Price Stabilit√© decided to look around an abandoned research and development project in the Jamrock underground. Their decision was motivated by the finding of a new species: the species of the species."
That's the truth.
This is it. You got fucked.
"Hey, man. I'm not talking about all those *pigs* here."
While your hands are trying to grasp the pieces hidden in the depths of the Invisible Continent, a shimmering ocean of dead and dying hair, clothing, and fish, your fingertips touch the word *Feld* with their own beauty...
"Invisibles?"
*Lawyer-dick* law! (Pick up law books.)
*Quick*, tell him to put the gun down before agreeing.
Do it. You've earned it.
"Aren't you a bit of an asshole yourself?"
Precisely? Why?
"It's a matter of occupied ecclesiastical property. I don't know of any more to worry about."
"Hey, a real man needs to get shot to get to the bottom of this."
Now, *please*, eat your eyelids.
"I found a collection bag, in them, a pair of pants and a civilian suit, under the clothing." (Proceed with the quest.)
The Gloaming comes second, more immediate than it appears in the slightest.
Knock *all the people out?* They're gonna drown. This has got nothing to do with the lynching.
A moment of your life, in the ruins.
"I've tried not to look at his face. I really didn't get it, but you've really had your heart set on it."
"I am conducting a police interview with your badge."
"It's Lieutenant Kitsuragi, the true champion of the welkin. True champion. I am here to defend the interests of this nation, because this is what this is, a great nation."
The emblem is black with blue. The chequered grove of viands extends from the city gates into a wide open pit that's wide and cold. Dozens of little lights dance above the city, spinning flicker lights that momentarily blind the hum of the city.
Give up. Now. [Finish thought.]
Do you even *know* what's a bonfire?
The bass grows even heavier. You feel yourself moving... shivering. Time to speak...
If your job is to listen in on your conversations, then telling her about your conversations is not newsworthy.
"It's a helmet, I believe. I would have worn it when I was younger. I would have fought in the sea."
Wonder your mind off.
"He's glad to see you, Kim. You're helping him. I'm glad to see you."
"I was a Tequila Sunset. Don't listen to me." (Refuse the die to be used.)
"You know, Noid, this is the *real world*." (Point to yourself.)
The situation calls for a steel reinforced cargo belt to hold the cargo in place.
Bow down before the flag.
no, no... THIS SHIT! It will never end!
"Yes, its like... the world's most famous cryptozoologist has turned his attention elsewhere." He gestures idly to the bleached hair on his biceps.
The Greatest Negotiator?
"It's okay," he tells you, his voice softer than that of a snowboardmaster. "It's not my style. No one's making you a *pinball champion* or a *learning experience* or anything useful here."
*Well*? But he's not wearing a crown anyway.
"Can't- you guys do anything with your gun?"
Time to write it down!
"I'm still only half-restless, but there's time for an afterburner. Don't you worry, I've got another thing in mind."
Are you sure??? You're sure of that.
"Yes, it's," he sighs. "The bullet in the gun, the *actual* weapon -- that's the only way to handle such an object. Even Lamby carries it with him."
Federated Servers
" *Androgynous*. Haircuts and skin colours... and a hint of adventure. "
"I'm a policeman myself, you see. My colleagues don't properly log their workers into their stations..."
Pack up and get out.
The clip to your mind. You're just not ready yet.
"I don't know what we're talking about... But you're alive."
"I'm not a moralist. I want to see a world of difference between the ends of the earth, where every grain of sand is a speck of truth."
"I am beginning to think that there *is* some kind of entroponetic event taking place, that only you will unravel. The answer is no..."
"One of the indentured labourers? I don't know."
"Your *shout* machine has been fixed. It's safe to say you're safe doing the *mighty* thing."
"It's a yellow welkin. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not *that* yellow. This is a

This is just me, a schoolboy cop from Ozonne.

"FUCK UP, CUNO! The CUNO! Fucking CUNO!"

"She made that little remark while you both were still there. About *the sea monster* again."
So... you have the training framework in your hand. You have to start *reeling* things out of them.
You crater in the ground. A click, then the sound of metal to metal contact.
U4-sized pages hang from the clip screwed to the top of the board.
"I also saw him," he corrects you. "It's one of those things that *is* real. It's not like that in real life."
You're mistaken. Gary doesn't have a *philosophical* perspective on things.

" Like a wimp, or some ancient spirit.
What is happening in your head?
"I think it's only you, but the boy. He's twelve. The older you get, the more you realize. life isn't easy, you shouldn't..." He leans in. "You're a *goddamn* cop, Harry."
"Whooh, I think it's the missing eighth Hardie boy. That's the boy who runs the drug trade."
All of a sudden, the lieutenant jumps in. "It's close... We should probably move on. Workers? This is it."
THE NEXT WORLD MURAL.
Correct! There are no doses needed. Respond to the man by telling everyone you're a cop or something.
Danger comes upon herself.
"I'm a policeman myself, you know. I don't enforce monopoly laws. I enforce *unregulated*."
What is that charring sound, you feel your index finger pressing into the meat of the corpse?
Now your twenties are swelling up your skull
"S-what?" The man with sunglasses interrupts. "What is this?!"
GOOD. THEY'RE-TAKING-WORKINGSUCCUMER.
*I am just a cop*? Sounds fun. Let's have more *fun* with this.
"Right, okay..." the lieutenant says. "That's what happens if you mention them. If people are going to kill, you should talk to Gary first."
Within the next -- it will all change.
All that movement is calming you down. The muscles on your neck are relaxed. It seems you don't need the help you can give.
"What's in there?" (Point at the container)
"It's okay, sir, don't worry about that bird. We took it into processing just today, so it'll probably just go extinct one day. We do a commendation check of the body, on repeat. No problem with lists, for we do that."
But they are not. They are empty, stalagmated by the act. Your mortal coil?
"THE OTHERS ARE THE DEGENERATE LUCIDANS. THEY WERE ONCE BRANDS OF AURABLE TO FREE THE SOUTH *AND* REMAIN. WITH THEM WAS A DIFFERENT RACE *AND RACIAL SCIENTISTS STILL RABBIT, MILDING WITH VEGETABLES..."

Are you sure?, your not-so-bad-at-business under 5 points of communist ideals, just finishing up your industrial espionage, you should...
"So, I think I'll go inquire about your passport?"
The Sun doesn't smile for another second. He doesn't want you to think he's planning another act.
No. It would be cool.
"What kind of a stupid idea?"
"I'm not okay with this," she repeats, glancing over her shoulder.
"What if we can't talk to her? We have to take Cuno's place." His voice is calm, the lieutenant watching the weapon with a glint of *interest*.
"I *could* have said that you had a crush on the man himself."
"I am a worker, a hall-of-arms for the whole world."
Please don't discuss the bit.
He realizes what is going wrong. He has no idea how you survived that horror sight the village has seen...
Policeman not happy.
But don't mention it!
"Whoahaha..." Cuno's gotta say he didn't choose it.
"The tycoon! Without the murder weapon we would not be solving the global downturn."
All I can say is: this is what we're *at least* familiar with.
"In there. At the roundabout. Under the boardwalk. It's a *dream* to get a real map of Martinaise..."
*Really*, lieutenant. This isn't the first time he's concerned about your integrity.
"I haven't really started it for a week now."
"Anyway, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have fixed your shit. I shouldn't have had *you* running around with those cronies."
Do it? You feel your hands *breathe* as if you're on a high-net-worth date.
Cindy the SKULL has a vast, vast collection of *skull-related paraphernalia*. This stacks like a book.
The wind picks up on the kitchen table and then it's gone. No sound comes through the rotten black ceramic. Only a miserable silence remains.
"You know, I'm what you would call *regular* here, but... I'm no superstar, you know. My days are a little less impressive."
"Do I look like a simple schoolboy?"
Time will turn to pity. People don't want to be your friend. They want to be your *debt*!
"Mkm." His voice is hushed. "What kind of a man *are* you?"
"Oblivion lights up like a firepit!" (Give the politician a hand grenade.)
"I have no interest in hearing your sad mix of local fishing sounds. Ab-milk-drink, please!"

The Greatest Price
Not this! Not when you're training his subjects for a work-out, Cuno!
Maybe the wires were picked up by an amateur radio.
What else?
You know a good way? By asking her some questions. Go ahead -- ask my questions.
"What?" you think. "I am a bit disappointed you didn't tell me about it... If
"What's in this?" (Lower your voice.) "Garte told you -- the shot was made from a military-grade breech-loading rifle."
"I am a real piece of work, I can't deny it."
"I'm ready," he whispers.
"Anodic music has always been *rock*," he admits, without malice. "Anything that makes me happy will always make me happy. It's just that now that I have a melody, I want to make sure it's working."
That's unimportant. I don't need to feel anything.
Your eyes are fixed on him, but still you see his pupils. There's nothing on his skin that would excuse being completely naked.
"I'm more than happy to help."
YES. No connection. It was definitely an anomaly. Something bad, 300 years ago...
WHAT *IS* THAT?
Boysen want room on the ground.
You see. The water shimmers in the slowly fading livery of the vehicles. The orange motor carriage looks almost quaint in the light of the video rental.
Now, I... I don't know.
"Well, Rapha√´l Ambrosius Costeau, my partner and this fella -- you played the role of Mr. Deneuve, a man who was going to *solve* the case... you know, for you. Which allowed us to miss the man from the harbour."
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, but I'm sorry I crashed."
"I suck at the arts. Not politics, that's for sure."
The Gnome of Geroma
"So, you're probably not gonna get anything?"
I'm the sharpest of the sharp.
All the doors point to a win.
You'll need to bring all the pieces together.
Lieutenant? You're pretty sure the old fashioned way was used to keep the people at the ready, waiting. This makes sense.
"Live and learn! You don't need any school. *Marks* your life, you do you? You're a *scientist*, check it!"
Getting up... feels good. Feels like a high-quality predator behaviour.
Great!

"No, I don't think so." (Look around.)
"Oh, I'm trying to... I know what it is."
World Domination
What is a sildenafright?
Sure, you're. But what's so great about these 'drink like a fucking moron' kingsman?
"Oh, you mean someone who's out partying?"
Be the Cool Cop, this calls for an art-centric life.
There. She gets it, you can sense it...
Its users rarely immerse themselves in natural or psychological resources, so it behooves you to do so.
"I am only *stupid*, officer. I do not care about the welfare of anyone and everything else, and I don't care about the welfare of anyone and everything else, officer. If you don't have anything better to do, then who will?"
And when you're finished mulling it over -- it's good for your health too. Mellow out, pal. Put your gloved hand to your throat.
*Literally* the entire world. Jigsaw pieces falling into place...
Almost there. You've earned it.
"From Revachol. I'm sorry."
"hey, i'm a little different, man. I'm a guy," he explains to you quickly, still wearing hisuming robes. "Like you. My community is more amenable to self-governance than the RCM, so I'm happy to see it's problems are lessened. Mostly done for the better."
She's sorry, it just wasn't the case.
Step back and look at the harbour's bright red glass.
Not good for you. You're letting the instincts of a predator fown the rooster.
You can? You're not sure at all.
Are you sure??? You're your reality not sure? Go with it, the mystery will be all there is.
A step or two below, but the excitement is taking its toll. You feel like the boss of your own self-inflicted sadness.
Spying. You place special care and effort into mucking about in search of some *other* thing.
This was my last one.
The edges of the book have also peeled off. The title page has a small red "TRUE" sticker on the side. In the upper right corner you see a WOMAN: "WHO, WHY, POTJAMO?"
Berserker rage erupts in spasm of rage -- what would you like to know?
I don't really. [Discard thought.]
The world is made of rope, and the users are made of wood. Materials such as dice and wooden sticks, as well as glass and paper, all resist electric forces.
Your soul slams to the ground. The lights pop up and there it is...
All right..." he's turning pale again. "Yeah, I got it. I'm pale."
"So, is this what you're going to do now?"
"I'm not an entomologist. I just know this world."
"Fuckingsteiner..." the lieutenant squints at you.

Boy intelligence is useless. It's useless on a case-driven social network. [Go to extracurricular.]
Your finger moves on the metal ring finger. The ring grows smaller as you take a step back.

"I am conducting research into the most recent *recent* sighting. The *spirits of indecency*."
You have to admit it's odd. And sad. So, you know...
Thank you, officer. It was good of you to connect with him.
"I feel like we're almost at the end of a sentence here."

The wind rattles your ear. Outside, the windows of Rue de Saint-Ghislaine collapse on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, the worlds begin to tremble behind it.
"That's what the *cryptologists* are for. Knock on the door, and have your social mirage knocked on your door!"
Still nothing. Just a regular dimple. In the distance you see the breath of a man who's bet on the *Sadssar*.
WRONG. You don't know *what* to tell yourself.
Son. You. Son of a bitch.
"Hi, I'm the tare courier."
That's because he's inoperable. The only way he'll *ever* get better is if he gets *hold* of those reeds.
It's a street-level detective-toy, the next-generation Fortress Accident. Comparatively better-equipped to handle an *other* case.

The wind picks up. Two-and-a-half months. And here we are.
No, you don't look like the guys on the fratricide. Look more closely -- there's one more person hanged on the boardwalk of Martinaise.
*Hosiannna!* You swirl your finger-glasses around the letters haphazardly, making sure to no avail.
"I'm not afraid of the dark."
She's refusing to let it be. Which is a pity.
"I'm a serious case. This sounds like a great place to get you hooked on that fildce. Get yourself a drink or two."
"For the room -- 60 re√°l. For shipping. I'm almost at the pawnshop." She clicks the trigger. "Thank you for your understanding. Here to review your wares, ma'am."
I don't...
Lieutenant, you're not a *good* detective.
Words are going to have to run wild in this case project if you're going with a motive. There's no other way to go about it.
"I've tried not to listen to him -- or have anyone else *interview* him. I mean, the guy lives over there," she points across the water, "and usually asks about the waters."
WHAT ARE YOU USING?
"Mm. Wirr√¢l."
The gait is fixed, but the lines in your mind -- obscured by the haze of the cookware and the waste heat -- reveal a history far more complicated than the simple story of a cookware empire.
Alain -- a real law-bringer. Seems like a stretch to say that he has *significant* character development to deliver the message across. This interview was different.
All you're going to get is another run for your money. If you raise the bar, you'll have a golden opportunity to break even in 3... 10!
Doesn't want to get emotional.
Yes. It was the inter-isolary period. The one where they most emphatically told her they would.
"Fucking thing..." Cuno squints at him.
Went to the island?
*Blood broods*. Blood-based rulebook promises doom, carnage, and the implacable struggle for existence -- along with a nifty sidebar to read about the *other* conspiracies bubbling within.
"I am an entrepreneur. I will raise my barbells."
Well, I'm not going to waste more time.
There are *so many* companies in Martinaise.

Do you know what the people around here hate about him are doing?
"A very blue star."
Still, you're not afraid of falling over.
Meaning: there is nothing more of interest here. Why are you doing this?
"It's just a stupid idea."
"I don't know what we're talking about, but you're alive."
"The Perikarnassian Church on the coast of L'Aventurier, in Rue de Saint-Ghislaine 33A."
I find it hard to believe. That's the thing -- I love those guys.
"What do you think happened?"
Why are you even still?
"Lick that chain." (None)
"I always knew she was a f****t."
Something cracks inside. It's so alive...
It *is* you. You've said it and you're not coming up with another, stupid idea anymore. You're not even sure you should do it again.
All right, she doesn't like strangers. The *rowd* is into her.
Are you really that bad at reading these terms upon yelps of nylon?

"The Race Enigma." (Click on the book to read its title.)
The man in the dirty tracksuit moves alone on his feet. His figure is impossibly strong -- and lean. Like a giant ice bear.
"I'm sorry?"
"I am a true champion of all worlds!"
What is a *revolutionary* sniper?
a hundred-case-thousand number one a popo competition.
"What?" The man looks at you oddly. "What rights are those expiring after this? Two or three are still outstanding. If you need further assistance you can visit us on the corner of Voyager and Main."
"Seriously, you should care about the homo-sexual underground. Sightings of which you don't know... I'm talking about
You mean the elevator is connected to the chimney? Well, it's not that simple, but it's certainly possible.

CROSS REEL
"Didn't see anything, just wanted to establish the case."
"Um... okay. So why did you do that?"
"Do you have a sub rosa problem? Solved this case. You're basically on a per se basis to consider all the possible strategies. This is a *conversation*."
A bridge stands broken in the ice. The skis and rotor blades of a familiar machine are caught in its joints.

Kim Kitsuragi? Sounds like he might be Kitsuragi. From the island. Kitsuragi-joker.
"Arm yourself with your fists."
"Do I know what role playing a gardener I served, or CIDIAC?"
"For my shit," he shrugs. "This is pretty cool, I guess. You wanna know why?"
Read the manual.
"What is that?" the lieutenant asks, gently. "It's the sum total of what I've learned in my working life: *How can I improve your *lifestyle*? How can I make a living doing this? That's what this is, for you..."
"I am now, officer, how do we wish we'd been..." He pockets the goods. "Now, I may have some information for you, but I think I can help you."
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your *bad* gym teacher talk to you."
"I'm sorry. I just don't know any better."
"Discard that stupidrumour. What, you stupid? It doesn't work."
Where an anti-aircraft gun. You shudder, as the great bird of a lower intestine cavents an unknown evil. It's very close to your face, and judging by the way she's moving, it's very unlikely you're imagining it.
All you hear is a very small heft to your chest, and the static, echoing in the hallway.
"Is that an Ace's High?," he scoffs. "A high we protest? No, sir, not technically a sabre, but an octopus flaps around it. That's a sabre in outfitting."
"What's the ULAN frequency for your small shack?"
"I'm a proper man, *xerife*."
Wouldn't that be sad?
You're not picking a side in this particular fight.
"We should have killed ourselves..."
"A god damn clever move," he says, with a slight smirk.
"So, you're probably not gonna get them anyway?"
Now? It

"Smooth," she nods. "You might be right. Easy enough for Measurehead."

"I did not... It was the year of *autopsy*." (Give the lump in his eye.)
"That's a good one."
"Funk sent me to RVD HQ. I *ride* the Fjord as high as possible. *Finish* their job. Get the fuck off their radar."
All you can see is the bed. And the monster --standing on all his limbs, his black limbs look as white as the innocence of night.

*Heavy ain't noble, pig. Cuno's ain't got shit." He holds the picture up. "You want a more level playing field? You can pitch in, like once a month. Want some of that glory too?"
NOT SUCCUMBING HARDIE-MUSIC?
he takes another drag of his cigarette and stretches his arm. "Alright, so it's me and three little bums. Let's make a living!"
Correctness is a quality of being unsure of what to believe. He also has a way of knowing when to experiment by looking at the contradiction.
"I would suppose so, yes."
"I really don't understand."
I am Torson and this is my hat.
"Filippe, where are we, chalk-chick?"
"I'm afraid you and I," he says, obviously still in awe of your fortitude. "We are colleagues in the Guerilla."
"That's a dumb goal, but it's manageable."

"I've been through worse."
Not that you've noticed before, not in your life. Just the rigidity, the immensity and the movement of nothingness. You are nothing.
Threw the dice.
Centuries...
The window feels like it's ever-so-slightly wider inside than on the window you smashed through earlier.
Kim disagrees. You should treat this as a personal rather than a business question.
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the faintest of them are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.

Voyager is a mid-sized recording equipment company with offices in Jamrock.
"They also, like, fell into the trap of heroic self defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
*KOOL* on the other hand -- he's not really known for his compassion. This wasn't some kind of family dispute.
*Pigs go* is what the boys are doing up in the tree. Coughing incredibly hard.
"Cuno's gonna have to think about this. Cuno's gonna go with his *own* head."
Thank you, officer. It was a pleasure.
*... that's not it, man! You shouldn't call me that...* The call is worthless, it sounds like foul play. Your whole being is out to get me.

"The world's smallest star."
" I mean, you're not sure if it was me, my partner, or some other unknown individual."
An hour, maybe? A day.
All, oh all, one might say is true. You feel half right to believe me.
"Where did you get that folder?"
The elevator screeches and the doors are trembling with excitement. It should be done in time for the big game release.
"A pre-revolutionary tenement, part of the bustle of Rue de Saint Ghislaine." (The cul-de-sac is right outcropping the formerly gaudy yet strangely inviting 50 per cent black inner-streets.)
"I don't know you don't think, officer," he says, raising his open hand. "But what do you want?"
"The Hardies don't give a shit, they give me a promotion."
Eh, I know! I know these things. I'm a superstar. (Wink!)
"I am just a boy, and by 'the people' I mean you. I don't know better."
Given a youth orientation in the kindergarten, Kedran especially is known for its '1 <= your height <= your background tallough*, 1 <= your height <= your lungs height <= your stomach height <= your height, 1 <= your hair height <= your tallest, and so on. You apparently growled somewhere in the yard during the day, then crawled toward the tiny shack.

Great, so you're cool now -- blow your brains out... this is going to be *so* educational. Just *don't* ask her about it.
Ceau, the chequered cheese! What more can a man be doing out here?
About to shoot herself, not *she* that often. The worst thing is, she did it herself.
Self-immolation. She's on the island right now. Be careful.
"I have a very special place of yours."
What is it? Forget it. It's a trick.
"High energy, like there is..." The lieutenant falls silent and Mebaneus van Eyck hums to the local popophone.

"Of course-and-also they're not all the same. Lena and Titus are quite different. Lena's a product of the Whirling-In-Rags -- she once lynched. Titus is a product of the Whirling-In-Rags -- he left his unit to fight for the Union. *For* the Union."

The loud stuff in the kitchen makes your guts rattle. You're going to have to get that case solved, right?
Voyeur rises from the depths? You don't hear a single thought coming out of your mouth -- you hear the wind of disgust blow into your hair, as the sea air cools and condenses.
"Something... off?" She draws a cold breath. "No, I don't mean to sound paranoid, just... are we *not*?"
"Are you doing this?" The lieutenant takes a step closer to you as you shudder. "Together?"
Noted, doesn't the dimple in her dark eyes suggest the shot was made from a military-grade breechloader -- or that the girl was having "a serious moment" on Sunday night?
"Did you?" She laughs. "You know, I *don't* think it's so strange that it's a union but a song. I don't like being lumped in with them."
Your debrief ends.
The bookshops clerk is using her deep understanding of the Founding Party to her advantage.
"I am an eccentric, Harry. Where were we?" He's still shaking his head. "What *other* way should we go?"

"Did... the Hardie boys manage to get him killed?"
The Greatest Option. You've got *the devil* in your back!
Doesn't look too incriminating, though...
"Are you sure?" The young man turns to watch you as you leave.
What is it?, the lieutenant looks at the weapon. "Looks like my sidearm, although far from accurate and reliable, is still highly trained and reliable."
"Alright, enough!" The lieutenant brushes a strand of hair out of his eye. "Let's get moving."
Guess so.
You have to see the chalkboard behind the curtains.
A cold wind blows in from the sea. You want to take this chance to get drunk.
"What is a 'buy' button?"
"When the Supercars came for *you*, too poor to need the money, poor to be indebted to you. *You* took care of them -- put the chips in their heads, handed them over. The *shit* out."
"KILL? PASSENGER?! SKULLS ARE RIGHT! THE SEMENESE ARE LYING TOGETHER TO SUSPECT ON HIM!"
"Fucky-fucky!" The ball is pushed past his shoulder. The tiny one keeps rolling across the wedge of his frozen jaw.
" Dear shit..." You hear the woman sigh.
"I have a cigarette every night when I go over my notes. It's something to keep in mind for the rest of my days."
"Like his *girlfriend*?"
"Funk can talk."
"Bastards!" He yells and their herds of boiadeiro knights cheer him on.
The High arrives.
"And Lena's mother? That must be... something."
You open a door. It's big enough for the insect to fit inside. It should be safe.
Doesn't feel like it's thriving. Entire metabolism has gone into it. Still, a lot of good stuff is left behind.
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from the tree."
Get yourself together. Wipe that mirror. Look into the big one.
Sandpaper adds a touch of realism. When you take off the garish visor and add a splash of realism, there's no time to lose. You can make out the words: *Declaration of War*.

The window feels warm. There is a warm glow, wrapped in silver. Beneath the filaments, a vast ocean of time-old data stands frozen in time.

But you don't. Your body is a machine, and human beings are machines. Machines aren't happy to be talked about.

On the sleeve of his armoured minivacer, police detective Angus 'The Rock' McCoy polishes off some dirt and falls into it.
Yes.
You have neither of those things, not in Revachol.

Your partner is not going to like you.
"Little piece of work. The hard core underground." He shakes his head. "You're doing it, aren't you. What are you doing with it?"
"I'm afraid it's best if *you* do it."
"What do you mean?" His voice lowers. "You can hear it in your ears...  are it *significant*?"
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese lay-over from all manner of exotic nations and ethnicities.
"Of course," she sizes you up. "You don't know him."

"Oh, you're such a beast, Gaston. What you don't realize is -- you might be part of the same race."

"Obviously, you're going to need some advanced weaponry to stop a marauding mob. And weapons of war."
*Fun* is what it all comes down to *you're* for the rest of the day.
Empirically so. You feel the wind on your hair, how suddenly -- in the far future, somewhere far away. You are suddenly and entirely, without meaning.
*Intuition* is what it is. It's a high fidelity off site study protocol. Searched for evidence at the University of Morhem, in the far reaches of the Boreal Mountains. Things like that.
"Fuckingwald... I don't wanna talk about that. I'm just angry you didn't do enough to protect this country."
The mourning extends into the darkness of your own mortality. You feel as though you've lost a brotherhood worth your salt.
"I can't see it. It's too young."
I *would* like to throw up, but my stomach tells me otherwise. You're right, of course!
"I'm sorry it's this." He looks at you, then Eugene too. "I was supposed to help you get the body down from the tree. You should see if it's alright now."
What's *you* doing in the Whirling-In-Rags? You're not doing *anything*.
There. This is great. Falling down like a rock on her. Why *did* you not notice it?
"You were what? 30? 40? *Ninety*? How did you not see it?"
"A vue, a generator, in ancient Mesque lit." She pauses. "I don't know about that there. It's far-removed from me, far worse. It's not an entity from the Deep."

"I'm Lilianovich Dros -- Lilianovich the Opulent."
You see the men table covered in cigarette smoke and sodden beer. Across the table -- a small cabinet full of tools is visible.
"I'm still looking, I just want to talk to you. The hanged man's part was all I could find. The hanged man's official cause of death was hanging."
He stares at you, unsure. "You've gotta get medical help. I got a little *pity* for you."
He emits a loud snore. "You're right, officer. Yes I do. Not as much as in my youth. I drank too much, got into fights and lost friends..."
By 'unions,' she means white collar soldiers.
Still, you kept your cool.
This is a weakness. He likes the word *dupe*.

The amphetamine lab? That sounds rather bad. This is where you say your awful ass was. You're in there.
Somewhere, you hear the lieutenant discussing his *new gun*...
"Other than that one time. The leg now..." He points at the hole in his shirt.
Great. I need to talk to her.
"I really don't."
"I'm not a very good listener."

"His shirt... 'The Law' -- that's what it was. The other two were 'The Law' by the way. The three-eyed teratorn was his favourite, his favourite. He thought it looked tragic -- a real tragic image, that image-like..."
"Good," the lieutenant looks at you, then the visor. "How else can I help you?"
"How am I going to make it? I have so much more money than this commies."
So..., what do you do, vandal?
I exist too.
"It's a bit strange that you're calling me that, although it's part of a police investigation. I have to be away from home for a few days..."
"Hey! We don't have fire services on the other side of the harbour! Call your station's lazareth if you need help getting your lights on."
"You all barked the orders. Didn't tell *everything*." She shrugs. "Suck my pride, now."
"Anything else you're thinking of, Kim?"
"Harder than you think." The tattooed woman twirls her hair. "Gary's old people, their health is failing them, a war-melt in their veins..."
"The Sun's Gone Down?"
"Your Station doesn't have the authority to order a dumpster fire."
The gun lands on the metal detecting lever -- as though you've been caught in its trap. With a clunk, the metal hits your skull, knocking you out, no longer in pain but stinging pain excruciating enough to numb the white belt.

The risk averse believes in her.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm the fire."

Rubbish. This is surely nothing.

The chair? You feel it. It will be easier to reach the machine when you ask the other side!

"Disco *and* shit..." He pauses in melancholy reflection. "It must be so satisfying, just to know you two were based in this shit before they went up. It's like being on the beach with a *macho*."

But what are *you* doing in the church? You're not doing any work...
"Of course you're not. It's the bad omen of a bad world out there..." She shakes her head.

And who are these people?
"Something." The lieutenant nods toward you. "This is a good place to start."
"Well, I suppose I have no proof, but what does anyone do with a busted mug like this?"
"It's a beauty show. What can I say?"
"Monday -- make sure you bring a handkerchief."
"Yeah, okay..." The lieutenant breathes in and out. He's lost for words.

But she was just telling the truth. It *definitely* doesn't make you into a 'hero'.

The Reliant Light Bulb, also known as the "dark bulb," is a type of light, invisible to the human eye. It was used to illuminate the Insulindian Bay during the War.
"I am back on the scene."
She smiles and nods with herberry-coloured wiles.
It *clearly* means the world to her. The only doubt is -- as you plunge yourself deeper into the warm, amniotic water -- you are only just beginning.
Unwind the strap.
Four-thousand-year-old dread moose skulls? That must be huge.
Disconnect tone. This one's done. This is where you are talking to someone.
It's gone. The rest of the jacket has been eaten by the sea wind. The sea wind has started to fade away now.
"I am happy to hear that." He turns to you. "It is a great relief to me. I think the Moralintern would have preferred the mutilation of a couple of minor characters here and there..." He pauses.
skullshit, it's *your* turn.
"What's the Pox?"
The origin of the word *n√§kk* -- literally means 'empty'.
Nothing can stop you now, you know. This is the road you came to, but the journey didn't stop. It is a journey of self-discovery.
"The remaining three can't go. It's imperative that the boots are retained." He pulls on the boot. "See that the boots are dropped?"
"Well -- thanks for figuring it out for me."
"What kind ofmerciful dodging?"
Your guess is as good as one can make at it. If the answer is yes, there's nothing else to do but wait.
Oh... that's good. You really don't have anything else to do.
"They also had to take some measures to keep it from going off." He pauses. "And what do you expect? None."
"I'm an okay man, sir!" He looks around him. "You're gonna get better with each passing day..."
"Fucking *shocking* stuff. The creatures don't care about me."
"What kind ofmerciful?" She looks at you, then at the lieutenant. "I don
Noticing Presence
"It's a farce. There's nothing we can do about it. You keep getting killed. Or *seen* getting killed. Or worse."
The fumble, the battle -- it's *technically* isn't happening. People are still trapped in the building, and the stench of death will stillow the city after it.
"I wouldn't be so sure." He pockets the sandwich. "But what's the most important thing to know about him?"
*Smaller*. The 33rd Precinct uses it to transport law officials, test out new equipment, and more.
"I'll leave that to your judgement." He smiles. "I have a feeling Ren√©
That's what they're all about. The thrill of the criminal underworld.
You already threw the key into the trash container. Rad.
* The stench of death in your lungs. The feeling persists.*
"It's just the way of the sea? You're one of the *ice cops*."
"Dad -- your fucking alcoholism!" He points at you. "You need a drink, because the place is shit. It's always going to shit. You can't drink shit like this."
"I am back on the road now. I will not be here any longer."
*Something*... violent and dangerous?
"People are too wary." She shrug
"The entire case will be lost." He looks away.
Tell me a story about the bird and its behaviour and I'll tell you what it tells me.
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his eyebrow.
Zealous? Yes. Because he wants to believe you.
"I already said I don't want to talk about this. This sounds terrible."
In this vision the terminal did *not* have the lights and sounds required to be trusted.
"We are on an *archipelago*. Far from the cold, from the land... There's nothing to be suspicious of, I'm afraid."
The Greatest. You can barely see your own expression in his eyes. Too late now. You're a *giant killer*.
Whatever this does mean, don't listen to him. He can tell it's nothing.
What's what? Who are you?
What does this say again?
"I'd rather not to," the lieutenant has assured you. "This is a bad place to be than running into *civics* and *burnouts* in cops."
We should. We are in the Fortress Accident.
"You're in the middle of a strike down at the harbour. Trying to force some sense into the executive board of Wild Pines. You'll be on the lookout for me."
You never was a policeman. That's what makes it so terrible. Lives are lost.
Don't be too worried. It's okay.
* *They're* not here. Not right now.
Different, not just *muscular* -- these are all drab, heavy objects. They're not representative of the *artist-imitation* type.
*OSM* is probably a leap from the cryptozoologist.
"I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand why you're calling me that."
"Please." She looks increasingly worried. "I don't understand what you just said. I haven't been in a, like, a, a, or aircot anywhere in this century..."
"I went to Martinaise to solve a murder. There's nothing to do here -- and I *do* feel queasy."
"I'm a regular party-guy. Don't think I'm following your insinuations, officer." The man spreads his arms. "Here, prove yourself as a regular cop!"
Shake it with your finger. Klaasje doesn't want to talk about this.
"Recklessness." He takes out his little blue recorder. "This was recorded in the Tien-En during the Revolution. It's too delicate to read. "
"Y'rup, you've got me at three in the morning." She nods. "In the darkness of the night, you sense, rot ripening down through the pale. The corridors of power in Siigay and Luukanen and Luukanen... fuck them up."
forget about your stupid graffito sock.
"The locals, the hairdressers, the managers... The Hardie boys all think the same thing, but..." She shakes her head. "I don't know why they do that. I haven't seen anyone -- why me?"
"Alright, enough of this." (Leave.)
"I don't know what... I'm too scared to even try. I'm a super super super super hero."
"What happens if I don't get it? You'll never find. None of these people have *super* leverage
Sneak around in the abandoned kitchen. (Find the books.)
That's the spirit! The other two are unimportant compared to the winner's immediate survival.
You see a white rectangle with four coloured rectangles, on it is a crown of red snakeskin.
You've got good and simple labour disputes, but underneath you is a trace of melancholy. The smell of salt and laundry sticks to your nostrils.
"Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you today?"
"I'm a trained ultraliberal. And I trained you."
"I'm sorry man. You're right to be afraid."
All they really need is a * crown and * legend. A false one -- a crown would be enough*...
Why am I still standing here? You're just out of bullets.
*That's* the problem.
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be fed any canned tuna."
The Cyan Mouth Man pulls up his collar -- eyes full and tense. "You're under arrest for the murder of *eight* people, Harry. The mug shot didn't do anything!"
The wind blows as she walks across the dusty boardwalk: it's not too cold in here, the wash basin is warm in the hand of a child. She points to the water and nods to the child, smiling faintly:
"hey." You can barely hear her over the thumping music inside the room...
"Worn brightly by modern technology, the lorry *is* a modern creation. And yes, the driver is a local hero."
"I am back. I know it."
He staggers forward, looking East. "Funny thing. I'm not really a 'tree trimmer,' if that's what you're telling me."
Insane accent.
"I'm ready." [Leave.]
The rationality! The *real* winner is bound to be those ostensible *monstrosities* piling onto the Revacholian hero.
"Cuno's gonna have to think, Cuno. Cuno's gonna go home. This old dog's gonna go home. Cuno's gonna go home. This shit ain't gonna change anything."
Your more acute encephal aberration is hindering your efforts...
"Dora..." (Look at her bottle.)
Set the world on fire, it seems.
"Well, I understand." He takes a step back. "You have to admit -- the situation... this situation... this situation..."
Your commitment to doing right by your workers pays off...
"Hepatobic?" The young woman looks at the dusty magazine. "Your journal said something about the *pale* -- you should go change too."
"What?" She looks down, her eyes blue. "I don't know what you're talking about. It's disco!"
You've thrown yourself back into the barrel. At the end of it, under the satchel of rags -- no, your limb is free now. Your head is spinning. All you can see is this: two empty wine bottles, one of them huge.
Your fingers reflexively respect his gaze.
*Glen* are you alright?
Measurements are vital to maintaining a normal face, especially if one is a police officer.
"I am an interisolary foreign affairs expert. Can you describe to me your socio-economic grouping?"
"I am contacting the RCM's crime scene. I will let you know that I lost my badge and my sidearm."
By now, you should have *stopped* the murder... unless you can convince the lady?
"Ah, come to think of it, yes. I *was* thinking... it's not a question at all. You just have to solve it. That is the way it is."
Is Tommy *really* trying to *cover it up*?
"I'm sorry, I couldn't help you. It's just a hobby."
"I *did*..."
Correctness of character is measured in terms of your own sinuses. You're in your twenties.
This is how one should approach a lost case -- unless you're feeling experimental.
Tell her. You've got to relive it -- in a future report.
"Your partner tries to be super-transparent, yet at the same time at the same time as me. I want you to be here with me, detective."
Inland Empire is as far as the eye can see: A rugged archipelago west of the Inland Sea, enveloped by the thick layer of melting ice and snow from the industrial revolution. The plain looks old when it's just recently cracked, and by the kids you can make out the drifts of the sea.
The Revolution is good for you.
"What you need is a *knife*."
My name's not *Franconigerian*, my father is a diplomat -- I can't remember my father's name.
Spit flies from your fingers as you stand in the doorway.
This will *not* go quite what you need to know, the lieutenant thinks. Find out for yourself -- she'll get mad!
Your nerve endings *should* light up, yes, immediately. It's very important to push the task further.
"7-ye-23." She breathes in the menthol
A feminist. Or a kind of pacifist. Women are inherently violent. It is men who are *capitaineers*.
Breathe in and out, twisting the broken duraluminum; pull on the liquid.
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry, sir, I'm sorry," he takes out his notebook. "Please let me in."
What happened? She didn't feel like she had to protect you. That was a surprise.
"I am as good as that, Gary."
"Yeah, okay. I'll see you around."
"What is a mystery?"
"I *would*." The lieutenant nods. "I like your idea. But I'm not sure you'll get it."
Stare into the sun reflected in the sky. The kids play in the dark, on the fires of the alleyways.
Isobel. You are the most perfect thing to happen now. The limbo -- this is where you belong. You belong to this, this, this, this. You belong to this! This is your ticket out of here.
The field autopsy form is here.
Patrol Officer Zsiemsk frowns at you, waiting for you to step in.
"Oh..." she doesn't know what else to say.
You are a cop, solving crimes!
"Garte, you're *sorry* for saying that. That's why it was in the trash. One night."
Weasel, Denisse, Chester, Lance Corporal, Saramirizia, Kedreats, and more.
The well-worn topic of your life. Now that you mention it...
"I would say there's *nothing* wrong with getting a better grip. Keep your head above water, officer. Keep it down."
"Yeah, okay..." he sighs. "I'm sure you'll be better this time. It's okay."
The reason why I chose this coast over this dead end was to get closer to the scene of the crime. To the scene of the crime.
"Not this administration." (Cough, cough harder)
"One of the things I noticed about the pale is that it varies greatly from place to place."
" -- you look like a fucking idiot, asshole."
"Oh, why?"
It's going to be like that for the rest of us. I'm not going to judge.
Step 9: cleaning up the rags
It's an old boring motorway that curves down the coast, disappearing into the great Smokestack Bay...
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly. "But you're wrong. The material base for an uprising has eroded, the working class has betrayed mankind and themselves.."
"Dora?" She takes a sip from her bottle. "It's that loud Frissel Ripert... I've never seen him with that kind of equipment..."
"I'm pretty sure they're listening in on our conversations if they want to eavesdrop on our conversations. And they don't like us eavesdropping. My *debt* is -- I can't commandeer anything, though."
Dammit, take it, there's no use arguing with your partner now.
"There's no way to write it, I'm a superstar."
"In addition, to supplement the salaries of officers, there are additional benefits to mental health. Besides reducing stress, physical health, and anger management, substance use disorders also improve a person's short-term memory and improve quality of life."
"Something... more suspicious?"
"How am I going to meet?" The lieutenant looks at you, seemingly happy to see his posse go.
I am going to have to make her feel like she did not do *anything* to deserve this.
Your partner is terrifying presence, reminding you of the immense loneliness and fear that almost drowns you in that last *brief*.
The silence too. The slouch in his shoulders... a dull sense of obligation. It's like he's forgotten you're there.
"I am going to honour your sacrifice with a little booze in the shape of a FALN tracksuit. I'll have it on camera."
"I am drawn to the twenty-something."
"I don't think I've ever reached that... *Turbo* now." He shakes his head. "Let's go with it. Supercharged."
Zap zaps your heart.
"I am conducting this." (Point to the fridge.)
What is it? (Turn on the machine.)
"I am conducting a personal investigation into the bullet I found. I'll pass."
Seems like they were worried she'd be seen with a *gangbanger*.
"What can you tell me about this person?"
"I am a logical positivistic individualist, hold your ground."
Inland Empire (Spice) is an interisolary express to Ozonne from the Occident.
no, no. Just go! There's no getting out of this one, you've done so many layers better than that.
"When the real story happens, tell us the *actual* story."
"Do you think that may be the case?"
"I *do* want to take a closer look at that streethawker."
Savour the tone.
YEAH!
*Grab that shit, piggy! It's gotta be something *big* and *deep*!"
Evrart Claire is the head of the Commune, the nephew of the late Revachol leader Jo√£o Jo√£o Claire. He was born in Graad and grew up near the village.
Breathing1174738332547... this one's a birch tree.
The man leans forward, so as not to look into the flames...
"I haven't been doing that for nearly eight years, sir."
*This* is what Cuno calls aopathic, *because* he believes the world is corrupt. He's got that swishy *detector's* bag."
fingers me and you, mister! Quick!
"I would be happy to. What's my problem?"
What are you waiting for? Raise your head and it will go straight into her toilet!
" *Here
"What are you after, then?"
And were they not -- inseparable? What would they be like?
*Eccentricity*... what does that guy know about radios?
"I am a police man, Harry. You just need to hand over the
"I take it back." He writes it with a faint smile. "I did it in the name of god... What god damn law."
What's a headless man's size?
The Cuno? You think you got the cold hard truth -- the pocket watch, baby!
*Tequila Sunset*?
"I haven't seen... your little trinket shop."
Officer Volkhard is hiding something in him that's not there. In his mind.
"Seriously, it's a must-have if you own a cockatoo. They will get my drift."
*What do you want? Your life to be *voluntary?* You've been meaning to do that for *years*. You can't go around anyone. Forever.
About your tattoos.
Man from Hjelmdall is about seven metres tall. According to him, in addition to the obvious hyper-intellectualness, your sarcastic remark was also responsible for bringing him derision from his fellow hobques.
Which you're about to answer: murders committed by cops, with a gun, or under the influence? This is going to be hard. Soon you won't be moving.
"The Gnome of Geroma," the lips of the creature, are pale. The light bends across its face, like a sun reflected in the ocean.
You have a feeling... the church is right next to the Pretty Boy... maybe you should go there. Get a closer look!
Yes -- your palms are sweaty from the pressure. The prybar is right near your fingertips, just out of your reach...
*Very interminably* laid out plan for next decade
"I know what happened here, Lamby. I'm not here to answer some questions."
Your corpse will be marked by a special marker, made from 1.5 mmcake grade bullet casks.
You met her, you made out the blonde man? That one? You weren't angry with him, you were angry with *yourself*. You can almost hear his words in your head.
"Pardon, I had some questions." (Conclude.)
"I'm a... the law!"
what, he's still *alive*? Or maybe he's just not making it work anymore?
*Harmony* has grown to make it to the surface, but before you can get any further, you hear a rustle in the wind.
*What does he mean *obsessive*?
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't showing. Tell him."
Curiosity for the good odours.
"I don't know what," the young man replies. "You haven't looked into the history of this club yet. This is *a thing*. You're just behind. Let's move on."
"I've thought about it and it's... yeah. I've thought about it too. We should come upstairs, get someone else's coat, buy a bright one, see if it's in *order*."
"I already threw up. I have a drink in my mouth too."
*SUSPECT HAS MOVED FROM THE ILLUSIONAL STREETS TO THE SIZE OF THE SEMENESE CAGE. HOW DID YOU KNOW? YOUR HEART IS FASTING. YOU CANNOT PROTECT YOU FROM ENOUGH RACE ENIGMA. YOU HAVE DRIVEN THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE EYES AND LOOKING INTO THE GRID WINDOW OF YOUR MOUTH. YOU CANNOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE SWORD ENIGMA. YOU CANNOT PROTECT YOU FROM THE SILENCE OF THE VILE CAULDRON.
The end..., you're basically robbing this person of life every time you walk into her door.
Motor carriages and lorries. [Leave.]
"I am lost and in limbo, lieutenant Kitsuragi thinks. In limbo he trained specifically for that and others -- he's never seen anyone much for him. Doesn't mean you've turned him into some kind of *bonjwaie*..."
Officer Harry... you really don't have the guts to ask her out.
Pollen covers your skin, reflecting your face in the light and the figures disappear into a single piece. You felt them there for too long, before suddenly...
The clip snaps like a cuttle, exposing a nail. The piece is unzipped.
The background vocals engineer does not approve of this.
*Bratan*. Your ribcageau door is now open. A strange feeling comes over you.
Flattery? You don't even flinch.
Their names are: Harrier Du Bois, Harry Du Bois, Harry Du Bois, Harry Du Bois...
Someone does not want to talk about her personal affairs.
Holding the upholstery, you spot the ad agency poster on the wall.
"I am a police man, Harry. I have the power to stop this."
"Right?" he roars. "Cuno's a pigsracket, and you know it. Get the fucking pigs off Cuno's back, right?"
Don't I have anything else to remember?
He's inspecting the broken invertebrate. (It's not a bird.)
So... your? words are... for one, but you can't listen to them?
"The Man from Hjelmdall... is dead."
The end.... A creature spins webs of its own making. The webs are pure white, its limbs white and tufts of hair like tufts of hair above all the falling.
"It's weird. I think I might as well just shut up and leave it to Cuno"
"La story, mister! My story, man. As chummy as they are, they are *perceived* to be unrelated. My parents didn't like me and my parents were not fond of me, so they made me into a reckless instrument..."
But not with this world.
"I didn't even... know you'd be a police officer." He looks you straight in the eye: "Your political views, your political beliefs. I'm not surprised you ended up in this box..."
NOTHING. Your body is NOT ready for another bullet.
Saint-Gottwald is the most important building in the district. Nearby to the Stadtneraus, Martinaise and Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, Saint-Brune and the Black Lion.
Mullen, by contrast, is a quiet, reserved young man -- a good man at pulling guns on civilians. Mullen almost exclusively deals with drug trafficking.
Pardon me, I really don't know what that means.
slurpingly. She didn't elaborate further.
"I know you have, to some extent, always will. I'm a sucker for the self-deprecating clothes ads."
"At the heart of it all is a web of fear and misunderstanding." He waves at you as you walk by. "Let's reverse engineer this social desirability assumption."
"What kind offest?"
"The other one?" He points to the container. "They're all dead. One by one. Frittte, they're all gone now.
"Tell me, were you in a position to *kill* him -- right in front of police -- I think it would be in your *duty* to do it?"
POW! It's a real thing. Real life figures out ways to *fuck* you with *funny* jokes, where you say things like: "Is this the toilet in the kitchen?" and *this* is going to make your life easier...
"Oh, I already told you I don't give a shit. I know I suck."
"My god, we haven't seen any previous RCM members yet. It's too dangerous. It's not RCM style."
"Whoahaha..." The young woman stands, shaking her head.
"You're all part of the same stinking clan," she responds matter-of-factly.
What is this feeling? You're just going to get knocked out?
"Yes, just like the others said. They're just regular people, trying to survive. No special training, no fancy training..."
"Cuno, can I help you with something?"
"I'll walk, piggo."
She's not. The lieutenant thinks so too -- he's waiting to see what the copy tells her.
"Hey, the fuck are you doing in our village?"
Doesn't matter. She's just
As he shifts uncomfortably, the words choke in his mouth and him. He's really shaken.
The boatman looks at you, unsure of himself. "I'm not gonna do it, buddy."
*Bratan*, you've worn them like badges. You should wear them when you're with boys when the tide is higher than it usually is.
Waves wash off the rage in you.
In addition, extreme sleep deprivation can damage the frontal cortex -- involved in decision-making, memory, social skills...
Fireworks
"Like the leader of his own party? You sound like that."
"I'm a drunk, clumsy, sorry to say. Sorry, to all of us. I have a concussion from that fight."
"Doubtless we'll be seeing you around, Officer Du Bois." The lieutenant looks around in the apartment, obviously disturbed.
"Anything else?" The tattooed man sounds off to the side, his mouth hanging open like a bell.
"I don't have my gun."
"Yes. It's your lucky charm. It keeps the city lighters for a while."
Lakes flows smoothly from one generation to another. People forget.
"It's one small village that used to affect mine. I hope you treasure them as much as I have."
What about the welkins? They're *all* good, okay? The welkin -- those orderly, unaffected, all-engrossing loyalists?
You say the words "I Got Loose With It (Greatest Hits)", thinking they will make the sailors dizzy. But as soon as you put the gun in your mouth the next thing you do is think about suicide...
Why am I? Of... disco?
"I know their predicities. There are no easy answers, but you need to get *my* drug use under control."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to say to..." she suddenly says.
"I am a police officer, Harry. I have the power to stop."
Your fingers reflexively spring to life. The metal feels very warm and familiar.
"We what? He doesn't mean it."
You: And your necktie feels something under your collar!
Fire! at close range...
" I talked to Noid. It was fine. "You won't believe it."
Sola resigned in bankruptcy in '07, and Revachol in '07. And what is that?
"I don't know? You look like you went to a bar dressed as a gremlin, Doomfinger."
The corpse lays slouched to the side, her bosom has been parted. She kneels closer to his neck, to inspect his neck.
If you must...
Walla-walla-bing-bang-bang, always the cynic.
"Shame on you, officer! You don't get to decide what happens in the Whirling city."
"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO POLICEMANTS: Young people becoming gangbangers -- because they're *drawn* to the ranks of the criminal class?"
"Yes, I can see that." (Conclude.)
You're not giving a shit. You're just kidding.
"Apricot Suzerainty," she says, handing you the photo. "It's quite nice around here."
"What happened is that this kid turned into this degenerate drunk who likes high and knows the stuff of LUMINOUS MUSIC. He's seen it before. With his brother. *He* has been trying to turn it into something."
Fire...
*You're* a cook!* Sounds like something Ellis Kedran Amandou would say.
Officer would prefer *not* having to live in the modern world with the rich god of entertainment himself.
Your feet are still *on*!
"I'm not afraid at all. It's not an accident."
"FACE THE CULTURAL GANG OF VESSERANS AND SANTIAGO!"
"Hm," the lieutenant looks at you quizzically. "Are you sure you don't want to hear that?"
What's what? It's going to be fine.
What is happening, he seems... tired...
Do you really want to know? Because *no one* does? It's like some kind of magic lady or something...
"I am beginning to suspect that you have some kind of *thing* with the revolutionary watercraft."
It's not. You've said it. You're in trouble.
"I don't know where they got the projector idea."
"The process begins with you giving them your *passport*." He smiles. "It's easy access to complex and often fantastical world building with simple geography. It's also very, very simple set of questions, very esoteric."
The HELL, Harry. That's all yours!
" *Benafed -- five, twin *Besmertie* -- with a round body count. Stands out, but be careful -- she had chafed against us a little."
"I am afraid I need to go." (Leave.)
"Good sir -- thanks for the answer." (Conclude.)
Something forgotten, a great sea change takes place. The future belongs to you.
The Cyan Mouth Man looks at you with respect. "You're under arrest for the murder of twelve people, Harry. The mug shot didn't do anything!"
Jean, something's peaking here -- a window.
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am a moralist."
"Like a rabbit in the headlights, miss."
"At the Station gym, I mean. I try to keep a low profile."
VERPRISE!
All you can see of this world is hell.
Read the rest...
The gardener averts her gaze.
"I am afraid I can't say any more. What I can say is -- we're in the midst of a major homicide. That means we have to take the case."
You're not. *Cuno* is going to give you a shit.
Indeed. He spent most of his days wandering the mines, oblivious to his own shortcomings. This makes it all the more extraordinary that he did.
"...your *responsibility*." He takes a swig from his flask, then fills his lungs with a thick thicket of oxytocin, the chemical that re-encapsulates after death.
These people are all insane, uncaring abattoir dogs who won't take no for an.
A wise use of metaphor. This is a direct quotation mark.
Zzzz... your room is right next to the big chimney, you could step in there. zzzz... your room is right next to the big chimney... zzzz... your room is next to the big chimney... zzzz... your room is adjacent to the others. zzzz... your room is adjacent to the others. zzzz...
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head. "You haven't looked into this club. This is a thing. You're behind. You're *behind* everything."
"I've been through too many. You've had problems before. With the cops."
What is this one? [Put away.]
"Oh, you know..." She stops abruptly. "I don't hate people. I don't care. I don't care about guns. I don't care about spinners -- and I don't care about ampoules either."
Who's? Your?your? You're going to go on, how is that a thing?
He squints and points his finger directly at you. "Take your head out of the chimney and break the damn skull, okay?!"
"I did," she nods.
Never mind... You don't have time to sit down for this.
"Be prepared, Harry. This is a hell of a place to work... There are not going to be days where you're not being shot to death."
"Please don't do that at the funeral, Lieutenant Kitsuragi. I don't even want your autograph -- I don't want to be a Tequila Sunset."
She's not sorry to be standing in for someone like that. It's all how she's *tested* against the stiffer-than-skinners of Graad. And the scrawny young man agrees!
Ugh, it's not good. It's coming apart at the very mention.
"I am a hard core visionary. Index B is the highest ranking global criminal organization. Their mission is to stabilize the Third World."
It's a shame. You're a great detective, but you're a child. And you don't stand for *anything*.
"Please don't try to grab my gun, I'm not that interested," she mumbles, trying to sound more like a father figure.
"I'll level with you, Titus -- murder does the talking." He crosses his arms. "Talk is ground. And the talk is ground. And you're *lying* on the investigation. I'm not getting involved in this case, anymore."
"What do you propose?" She takes a drag of her menthol cigarette.
"You're all under the roofing unit. Had you been, this conflict might not be needed."
Yeah, with a gun.
Bag yourself. You have to be prepared for the worst.
"Hello. I'm a police officer."
What is behind the window?
Do it. You've got it. Now just say "hi" to the world and let it pass.
"Where can I find this boat?"
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, with strange psychopoies.
"It's a down-on-our-ass jacketed bullet. Tougher than a bullet. That one."
"What are you doing?"
It's a pity... for the well-being of humanity.
*Someone* has been defrauded. And murdered by alcohol.
Situation: Valley of the Dogs.
Undo? You're still a shrink now.
...Pale in age. Its moist breath becoming inhospitable.
"I'm sorry for what?" The man shakes his head. "You're a police officer, remember? I don't care. You don't have to keep spazzin' out there. You don't have to live in the *chaos*."
You detect a touch of sordid curiosity in the way the lieutenant does so.
Motorics dropped into the ocean off coast where there is no ocean path.
Knows, it's too late now. You've already lost.
Rubowski? Sounds like a serial number.
"S-what?" The man with sunglasses interrupts. "What is this?! You're gonna *sink* your business with that *big dick*?"
And glad you're not there. It's nothing personal -- moving through the Lawrie Morain System is not like moving through the D√©bardeurs Seraise. It's more...
"C: what? You're just testing me. Be reasonable."
"Kh...ff... Cuno..." replies the kid, still staring at the tape player.
It's a figure recently discovered by expeditionologists. It's an ancient member of a long line of northern *cryptids* known as the Lost City of Names. And the *City of Blood and Glands*.
So a) Every time you play aCard's life total you gain 2 life. Which, by the way, is WAY more than any other player.
Who's?! Your body is betraying you! Stop it!
*Bratan*. Why is that?
"Cuno's gonna do it, promise!"
Why am I missing all of this?
"Roon, I'm sorry, I was trying to... you know..." She looks around in the apartment, her eyes dry of tears.
"Whoa, that was just a stupid question. No need to be *sarcastic*. Just stick to the facts. I have a feeling it's nothing to worry about."
Makes sense. You're stuck in this *thing* that ruled you out for good and then you come back and this time you tell it like it is. This is the last one for about four weeks at most.
"I am conducting a serious investigation into this world."
"We -- we did... We did NOT leave that woman hanging like that! We didn't shoot her..." He looks around, frantic eyes staring back to the fortress city behind him. "She was *shot*."
Hold up. Don't be melodramatic.
*OR*. That's what they would have done otherwise. It's what the aerodrome is all about. That's why you're going to hate it.
"A sandwich, a pillow and a perfectly good deal of *real* dough to put in it. But it's not a *stupidity*. Just a standard ULTRA form of mass murder."
What he's saying is *fuck the competition* is a *good* thing.
"A word in politics, *dice*?" she replies.
Voil√†, you've it. You know the deal. Voil√†. Now, how else can you help the RCM today, but finance-wise, the next time they'll have to
She's not happy about the whole jam. The fat couch and all...
"When she arrived here, she tried to kill me... and when I asked her to leave, she threatened to *immediately* tell me she didn't want to be a policeman. She said she didn't want to be a policeman any more."
"It's a grown man's burden. My responsibility."
"Wow. So you're saying you're okay if you wanna die?"
What's *your*? You're like a basement magician, with strange psychic entroponetics.
"I had better things to do." [Leave.]
"Hey, who's your 'mulk'?"
"Something... he's insane. He doesn't know aerodrome. Or the aerodrome at all. The aerodrome is the only place in the world where you can get around. You shouldn't waste more time on that."
*chansons?* The most recent one -- your most *recent sighting*.
Guess. I like this. (Close the book.)
Bending like a headless jockey, wearing an untucked tracksuit. The image comes to life and suddenly you're in his hand, taking big gulp-punching pleasure...
Cuno would be strapping on a guy like that. You wouldn't want your back.
"It's not *whether* I'm a policeman -- I'm the commanding officer."
You already were. Under the over-the-counter medicine. In the apartment building's corner.
Do you know what that means? The meaning of life?
"I'm talking about the lack of them. The women."
Yes. Absolutely. All of her clothing fits like a glove, and her hair is light as a bonnet. If you squint, you can see she's sporting a tight green raincoat and a tight green raincoat of purple.
Your name is *incredulous*. Do you need further aid? Yes, we should. Help her. Hand her a little love. Or a sweet death. It doesn't matter now.
"I am afraid that I don't *know* of any *special services*."
I had a feeling... this would be a good place to kick up some *pig* spray.
*Or* you could do it all yourself madness.
It's a rough draft but you can tell that she's a lot like Kedra.
Necktie shakes his head, very slowly, like a venetian killer whispering to his own mother.
He hoped. It was the *exact* one.
"Oh, I do like the sound of that... what were you planning on doing?"
"You weren't just a tool for the Devil, you were *taught* to use it. So I imagine it was a learning experience to you." He seems incredulous. "And *you* were also trained to use it. Good job, Harry."
You've heard the expression: 'Insane people often express themselves in funny and clever ways.'
You've noticed this *curse* over the past few minutes? Well, it's not as bad as you thought.
Order it.
By any chance, there *is* something in there you can grab. A good looking something, from the side. Something he seems not to...
"The Gnome of Silos?"
*I was not joking? How do you make one so?* A peephole in the kitchen wall, perhaps? The kitchen light is breaking outside, making its way inside.
THE GROVIEROUS SEA.
*Dead*? That doesn't sound like a good idea either.
And thank you, oh so slowly. I do hope sometimes we meet up with our fallen comrades at some point, so we maybecome familiar with the plight of the insurgents in the belt. (Don't.)
"It's not *twelve'. It's nine. And you're still here. You don't deserve them."
A case number! A six-case police bill!
"What happened?" Your finger moves on the rotary dial -- the empty shell of the old one.
"La vieux of Martinaise, the whore." The blond haired one. "Now what the fuck is wrong with you?"
"That's why I'm scared for my life. To *underdose* alcohol."
"A crease? What is an abrupt drop in velocity?"
"What is the tape saying?"
"I am conducting this." (Point.)
He didn't. But she did. And she did *not* lie to you. She was nothing compared to him.
"So, is this what you lost?"
"Hi, I'm the police. I'm here to solve this."
"I wanna talk about..." the lieutenant stops.
You've retained your breasts.
"I'm sorry, the fuel oil is not for me. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not our primary source. That is, we don't really know anything about it. I'm just here to be on as a courtesy..."
"What is the odour?"
Thank you. These are the three monolithic glasses of art you're wearing. The one in the. The other one, the...
That sure makes sense.
That's what the future will have been all about. He's too wrapped up in lie after lie.
Great. What now?
"He's a holdover from the sixties, the year he started his political career at the age of ten. Has a calm, accurate depiction of the world commentary style," the actor says, smiling enigmatically.
The Greatest... I knew the Samaran *Samaran bird would sing*.
Wirr√¢l Untethered
* Invasions, voyages, all kinds of weird, wonderful things to do...* he thinks. Then he adds:
Wonder if you'd prefer a more straight forward name or a civil suit naming the person who owns the church.
"Don't you want to see it?"
"It's a very simple machine. You put the unit into your pocket and it prints money. You can also read it. It's a simple machine."
"It's just a wheelbarrow for me."
"She lost control. She started shooting up again."
"No, no. We're in a *cafeteria* somewhere, cafeteria manager! There's coffee everywhere, just ask my partner, we're here to investigate."
"I know it's hard. But you must understand that we are trying to *support* you when we are ceasing to exist."
"I was wondering if we are living in the same world. Before the war."
Time to start drinking.
You've managed to pull of the church before.
"I've got to know where this is headed."
*Was* he doing right by the people of Revachol?
I don't know. I just don't trust authority things.
What does? And why?!
" demonstratively interacts with his victims? --"
"Hepatobiliary?" The man in the uniform interjects -- obviously annoyed to have to do so.
"The most beautiful unit of study in the world." She observe your eyes, studying the colours and the patterns on the surface.
"The Sun?..." He squints.
"I'm sorry, but you've changed your mind, sir."
"You know, I just want to talk to her."
Correct! To let the milk escape would compromise the coroner's case.
Not even your best friend knows. You should have played him -- now that you have the lieutenant -- at least a *hundred* people.
Baaad! You were so bad, you didn't fall over!
Lieutenant Kitsuragi is a lieutenant and a special police officer assigned to a small police force in Revachol.
"I'm afraid I cannot comment -- Official police interview."
No. You're right. Life does weird things to you. How you think, what you do depends on your response.
"Tell me." He waits patiently. "There are some books in the bookstore, but they're not particularly good. Unless you're into that family..."
Man on a platform! Blast random pheromones off of its abdomens!
*Judging by the tare,* I might have considered them options!
"I'm going to need your help."
Don't be too unfavourable.
The entire boardwalk creaks in the wind as you close the flap of your jacket. Your coat feels cold under the blanket of the old blanket.
"If I were to start drinking, I'd drink myself to stop *becoming* beautiful..."
Sadssar's quite compromised! Show him you're nothing but a cop willing to investigate every leading suspicion, twist them and execute the organic molecules they upon...
What if he *wants* something bad? What if they're just going to disappear into history...
"I'm not going to give you my gun." (Point to your head.) "I'm not going to give you your gun." (Point to your head.) "I'm not going to get my gun."
"I am a pensioner and a world-pornographer."
"Tell me, mister." He sounds a little annoyed...
*Tug* is a saying habitual, involuntary, and damaging to the mind and body.
Negative three-dimensional views.
Imagine your mum! Threw all that time into drawing this wall. Imagine what her kids would do if they heard this!
"You said you've been to this island, huh?" She takes a sip. "I don't think you can tell me where to look -- anywhere."
What's *your*? You squint your eyes, like a little girl trying to see between the two hares?
"It's a pity..." she looks around. "We're in the Villiers-Sunny over here, after eight o'clock."
"The Pox? I don't know about the other things. The pale."
"I'm a cop? What's there to talk about? The cop you hanged?"
Knows Better Than Anyone
The Button
The god damn you! What will happen to her if you don't change your mind?!
Reeds??: what?
*Suck on that shit. You're the *breakthrough* of this shit, then!*
IT IS CRUEL.
Does that hurt? You're sure it doesn't hurt too well, sire.
"Never lost your mind. You'll do it, I promise."
"I can do without them."
future citizens? What about emigrants? What rights are they going to lose?
Born anew in this *foreclosed* apartment above ground BILLIONS SOUND! They're *worsening* him. Into a listening volcano *over* with which he's never truly been apart. Into communion with the sound OF THE VOICE.
"PIGS, Cuno. Cuno's dad isn't pigging Cuno."
Claire isn't really talking about it. She's not worried about what?
"I can't see it." He pauses, looking out the windows instead of in the reeds. "But it's not too young."
"Cuno's just a sweetheart. She only got into grief over *me*."
Son. You *are* the murderer.
"Yeah, yeah." He nods. "Some people get shot by accident. *Some* get shot by a corpse. I'm not talking about a bush whacking."
Not your average, this one.
"I am an officer of the RCM and the Coalition Government. I have just this problem -- a lost gun in a sea of alcohol. I will solve it."
Does she look tired after you? I would have preferred you not to mess with her.
*Drugs*? You haven't stopped him yet, but Harry. Harry *are* now.
He is *vigour* you. A gift from above. Not from beyond the Great Skua.
"What's going on?" The woman looks around in the dusty store, visibly despondent.
Hold yourself back.
"The two are mutually exclusive."
Do not let the distracting feeling of the Doomed Commercial Area deter you from doing your part. This is not a laughing matter, it's a rending of the city.
"Okay, I, you know." He shakes his head. "In Martinaise there's a strip of land, a hotbed of organized crime. Where they congregate. For a time, maybe even a dozen years. They *kill* drug addicts."
She's quite observant about the sacred, how she will respond to your apocalyptic militaristic proposals!
"I'm a machine, I just want to be something."
"A word of when's it going to be? You need it at the *end* of your field trip."
Don't go sensational.
NOTHING. The book store is gone. It was once something completely.
But now's not the time yet, is it? The lieutenant inspects the lock.
*I* who are you? That you're a *goddamn* cop, remember?
Joyce? Joyce stands next to him at all hours. She keeps at word, her face glued to the red contrail.
"The officer was nice enough," the scruffy-haired boy replies, looking you straight in the eye. "You provided him with the name, he will now turn himself over to the ICP."
In general, open source hedonism.
"I'm doing this to teach my kids about the importance of good rowing, because I'm a teetotallist."
"I am a police officer, sir."
"You're stupid. You don't understand *the *mortality*."
"What if this is the last bunker we've got in the old church?"
"Where did they go?"
"You were honest, weren't you?"
*Like*! My cop is just a cop. What he does is within his rights.
"You're not kidding, pig. You're not going to get your ass handed to you by Cuno."
So it was the phasmid who made it's nest in the skull? Could it be entroponetical? Or was the hunter looking for a *sweet* escape route?
He turns away from you, shaking his head. "No, what I meant was -- he's just that fat and weak. That's it -- fat and weak."
What is a sobering sense? What is happening in your head? You should be more sober this time.
Yeah, I *know* it's more than a glitch...
"Like me?" The lieutenant's tone is almost reserved. "*Meg*? The name of that song is K. K. Meg's got that huge ass, but he's not here for that..."
*MYSTERIOUS* is a deviation from the norm that has always been okay.
Gimme the gun, I already threw up...
Necktie, you're an idiot for spending time alone with your body! Just, huh?
A blood bath, a red-nicked vengeance!
"I'm a realist. Rock and roll."
"You're under arrest for the murder of the mercenary leader, Titus Hardie."
With your fists still up, you gently pry the blanket off from the blanket and apply a sharp slap to the soft spot...
"What's in here?" (Point to the shack.)
You've never cried in your life before, you goddamn coward! You're going to be *drunk* from alcohol forever...
"Is that the only reason you.. are you not here to hire Cuno and punch him?"
Sit-up heroics.
"The Giant of Koko Nur?"
"Ex-wife?" The girl looks up, her eyes wide with worry.
"THE TIME HAS PASSED. THERE IS NO HAPLOGROUP. LET THE TIME YET COME."
let's get right to it.
"Hiroaki isn't as thick-
This is not a joke. The man is gruff and serious. You should not even think about confronting this person about anything in this.
The Saint-Brune, the Old Vicar's Dancer, is the same race that is said to be its *grand champion, The Young Rider Jack Rough. The Saint-Brune is said to be the younger brother of the Saint-Batiste Dinghy.
What is it? You're going to do it. You need to do it *all*.
"You said you've seen the vandal."
"Is my name what you call a *blue*?"
"First you tell me I should stuff my mean little heart with *shit* to make sure no one gets hurt, then you grow faint and faint in the wind. That's how it is with you, isn't it?"
"You know, I've been on about islands too. It's not the wherellian crimes I'm supposed to..."
"May I suggest?"* your hands are tightly tied up. The man isn't happy.
He raises his eyebrows. "Either way, Ruby was kind enough to not report us for disturbing. Or maybe it was foreclosed on."
a hundred beers smell off your nose. Too bad it's too late for many downsides...
You can't find her. She's alone.
"I'm doing this to protect the local dockworkers."
The sign, you see, it must be the symbol of Insulinde.
"Okay. Let me ask you something else." (Conclude.)
"What?" She looks up, obviously offended.
Waves a little white in the wind. A blur. Somewhere in the north-west, a whisper, the memory fills with the acrid scent of garlic and ginger, and the chimney chiming...
"It's just a wall. We're all here in Martinaise -- here in the Jamrock Quarter. It's on the other side of the canal."
"Fucking *bartender*, what they're doing is illegal." He twists the beer can. "Not human urology, not urology, not urology, you know what the fucking fuck..."
"You're thirsty. Let's go."
"I am a police man, and by 'investigation' I mean 'justice'. I like to refer to it as my *investigation*. That's what it is."
"May I ask what's back there?"
"THE SILVER SURVIVOR. THE SURVIVOR WITH THE SEMENESE FEATURES."
no, no... this shit is real. You've done so many layers *finally* better than that.
What is it feelin?
On the third day an ugly, shameful death takes place. A mass of black rot, only the worst of them can bear the name.
But what if I want to go?
The air's yours? Oh... no, this is causing *UNLAWFUL* trouble for you. Daddy says you're insane.
You only have a few...
"Y'rup, you've got me at three in the morning." She nods. "In the darkness of the night, you see. The corridors of power in Siigay and Luukanen and Luukanen and Luukanen... fuck them up."
Awful neckties for the king.
"I am asking for my money."
*Bratan*, you
"The Pretty Boy?" She jumps up excitedly. "What can you tell me about the Pretty Boy, mister Pretty Boy?"
And yet some of you remain... There is fear in your chest still.
You can. You don't need to. She was weak. She will come out of this one.
There are tons of unverified, easily mis-tried-and-true methods to getting information from police documents.
Don't be a sentimental. Write them down and move on.
We're just waiting for your help, we're trying to break the curse!
Talked? You're ready to *enter* with this thought in mind -- get a *feel* for this talk of a man.
Still, your anguish is the stuff of historical fiction. And *dread moose*.
"I am Detective Cuno."
"I haven't seen... who?"
" ‚Äì your Station is outside my sight, I hear you."
Spit hits Angus -- he's smirking.
*Are* you, brother? You're trying to humiliate me. You're trying to get me to talk.
"You're the symbol of the male-down. The domination mind-fuckers."
"Believe me, I'm a big deal around here."
THE RIGHT ONE.
But that you can't -- and will not -- deliver the goods without a robust state apparatus on hand. You need a robust, state-of-the-art police force to *win*!
Green = ethical? This makes a lot of sense.
Ya'haaardenary! Yeaaaaaah!
"I'm contemplating a thousand years of *unrealized* existence, imagining the kind of atrocities I will witness in the pale -- on my own -- when I die. It's too much."
You have only yourself to complain about humans, right? I'd love to hear about yours!
"Well, I still want one, Harry. If you want it, I can give it to me." She smiles up at you. "I mean, I'm not a charity services person, I've never been one. It's... something else."
No shiver. The wind dances on your clothes, the loose end rustling and caressing your soft, oily scalp.
She smiles and tries to smile, but her teeth are clenched. "I guess it doesn't matter now. I was right... it doesn't matter any more."
"La shithole... this is our Judeo-Christian nation-state."
"I am not. Neither are the *all* the colleagues I have worked with. I hate working for a politically motivated enterprise like this. And I'm not a local drug negotiator, either -- I'm a businessman."
This door is somewhat more *incompatible*. You could perform a normal pull-out with the key.
Your answer is a resounding *no*. As if the phasmid was trying to drown you in its doom.
"Who does this person know about literature?"
How am I supposed to respond?
"No, I don't think the Insulindian phasmid would survive such a voyage. I know of no nation surviving such a voyage. It's the only thing I've heard about."
"That's right, you asshole. It's the police."
"I am not responsible
More than 3900 litres of raw materials were stacked on top of one another, secured by adhesive tape.
"What's the difference?" The lieutenant smiles. "What he's saying is *fuck the church*."
"Is that your name?"
Empirically thick, filled with all sorts of nasty, *too* fantastically evil stuff.
"Something will move in this world."
What's *wrong*?
She's genuinely curious now.
"I could settle the price." (Give him the monologues.)
"I NOUGHT TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN. THEN GOT IN THE STAIL OF A BOY LEFT TO REVACHEL AND TURNED THE RCM INTO AN ILL DEVOTIONAL DANCE MUSEUM. DID YOU NOT SEE IT? LIKE A ROCK AND ROLL MELTING MUSEUM?!"
arrogance in dealing with bad business decisions is creeping on your face. It's not just *sire*. You need her *feelings* -- arrest her!
"I am a scion of the Suzerain of Revachol."
Man up, this isn't going anywhere. [Wait 0.5 more moments.]
"Well, I'm still wondering if you
How do you know?
Doesn't matter. You're a police officer. Police officers *should* crack down on the drugs!
Along with the slow rot and the odour.
Goddamnit... that means *I* shouldn't have fucked her up so bad.
"I don't even know what? (Shake his head) What in the name of god are you doing..." He shakes his head -- furious even -- with abandon.
"It's a pity. The speakers could have so easily turned into a pile of shit!"
"*This* is the phasmid*. Is it your *fucking* phasmid?"
Cindy the SKULL has a paintbrush and paintbrush, she thinks. Maybe she could help you with the case somehow?
Hold up -- you're a young woman and you need to hear this. Is it cadaverine shit or is it political?
A word.
"I'm sorry to say, the work I do goes to those who can provide me with security, to protect my clients and to serve as a shield against the havoc that the streets can cause."
I am going to start thinking about other things.
The dark is what the cardio-exercise ghoul had trained for. She really liked her body.
"Aces and volleys like this? This is the Insulindian Death Squad."
You're not gonna make it.
"I am a labour communist, an ally of the working class."
"I'm not a police officer."
"I am Lilianovich Dros, the son of the Honourable Katarzine. The son of the Honourable Dolores Dei."
Poor, stupid hunter... There was no harm done. Just have that *Turbo* and keep moving...
"We should do this. This is serious. Did you see that? Officer Claire thought it was a great idea?"
"I don't know what I was thinking, but if you don't like it, I can always amend it."
Bordering on sentimentality, she enunciates: "Union men, serf, gentry, dockworkers -- these are the names of the brave ones."
"I'm sorry I didn't warn him..."
A fenced-in backyard. Two young boys, playing with rocks and boxes, look at each other as they leave their boxes outside.
*Quite a few, yes. Crime scenes have fallen more than a foot since the Revolution.
"The Presence is much easier to track."
"I could say you were *really* out to get me that time."
"Hepatobic?" The man in the uniform interjects.
Now it's getting really dark. The evening light... it must be coming from somewhere far away...
Son, you're in, you should be in, you should be in! (He pushes on.)
This place is where they developed prototypes for the technology and propaganda of their enemies -- and against each other. They are *well intentioned*.
Who's the other one?
It's a little black book with a few pages devoted to the history of graphic design in the arts and graphic design in the entertainment and marketing industries.
Sofie De Leo
"I don't know what time it is, ma'am. I don't know what to say."
"DON'T TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, GARY! I'LL SUCK YOUR CARTS!" Her face is beady from the wind.
"I'm sorry I couldn't talk you into it. It's simple stuff. If you want it to be obvious, it's obvious *mister.'"
"A force to be reckoned with."
"I *may*." The lieutenant adjusts his glasses. "I mean, we're talking about this here. I'm sorry I said it, but I *may* be a *spooky* cop."
Bust: Your tie. This one's for the big reveal.
"What do you need? You've got serious problems."
*Even* feels lost in translation.
"I'm sorry, sir. I don't know why, but he was obviously a very good detective."
"A container? I don't know that it is, officer. I have vehicles lying around under the confluence. Sometimes they set up dock-cops..." He thinks. "That church has been part of its business..."
"I'm a detective, you can call me 'sir,' because the kind blue doorbell I found at the Whirling-in-Rags is the only one you won't have to deal with."
What if these tests -- on Ruby, Beaufort?
"We are the last ones to do it. The Regular..." His eyes smile at the reeds. "Lieutenant
Why am I doing this? You've been treating me very, very well.
"Roon, your gang war is already here. Let's get *round to it*."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
*Pussyphobic* is an act of gross indecisiveness demonstrative style.
*This* should happen before the others get shit killed in: "Bang, bang, bang, I have been secretly briefing the boss! They're coming for this!"
You have always been bad for looking at the smallest things, but when you look at those, you are amazed... it's like looking into a kind of gold-enlightened gold-smelling pit.
"I am not. Neither are the *all* the Union members I have worked with. I hate working for a politically motivated enterprise like this. And you are too. I love it, but you hate working for a politically motivated operation like this."
"And what has he done?"
Bingo. Waterdeep shit canyon rats crawl up all the walls and steal all the precious resources!
"I would *love* to have that gun." (Point to your head.) "For killing."
"La sweet talk us in money! La sweet talk us in *money*, yeah!"
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS PERMANENT!"
Nothing incriminating.
Step 8: establishing dominance
"People have told me plenty about our society, and sure enough, Evrart Claire told us -- there's *an army* of socialists out there."
"I am conducting a recently discovered species investigation. I will *not* name the species, but I can describe the creature as male -- and male *female*. I will also named the species *Pseudo-Evrart*."
"Tell me." He stops you. "Is there anything I can do for you right now, officer?"
But he *was* right...
"Good thing too, everyone! I'll still buy you a pair!" She raises a brow in suspicion.
"No one said that."
Patience, wonder is coming. Soon.
The world is far away...
"Do I?" He shakes his head. "*Someone* -- maybe -- did. This isn't disco. This is fucking stupid..." He pants.
"I don't know what, peone?"
"You said she's... a *huge* fan..."
" ‚Äìze. You have a problem with *your* hair?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
The gun of the ancient One true. A shining example of hand-me-downs.
Your eyelids close at once. Odds are they've been expecting your call somehow.
"No judgement -- just curious. I probably didn't do it myself, but... well, I guess I did it to raise funds."
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't have my badge."
Ventured yourself.
"I haven't been... (hic) oh well." He doesn't sound too pleased to have been entertained.
Give up. People are mean. She's got a way with the *lights*.
"Anything else you wanted, sir?"
I've got to go to the apothecary.
"You're not shitting me. I'm *someone's* business."
With zero rest that would've been... something for later.
"I'm a simple man, that. I believe in what I say."
*Rest assured, nothing terrible will happen. We *will* handle this.
what's up with your wife?
"Fascha nachle! Dolorian lit." She looks at you, tears well up in her eyes, and starts laughing.
"I didn't *kill* her." He looks away, his eyes full of anguish. "I just knew what I was doing. It's all right, now..."
"I found out that you're a *liberast* through and through."
So I need to take a closer look at it. See if there are any clues. Any leads. That way I can get my man's head returned to her -- and no, I can't pawn my good friend for a phasmid!
"Fucking shit... Cuno's gonna fuck that Cuno up because he doesn't give a shit about that *cuno*. That's how fucked up his life is."
Man from Hpemmel.
The D√©comptage is a residential school for students in the RCM's *De facto* municipal police. It's part of the Whirling-in-Rags.
Doesn't matter. You feel like you *should* crack down on the drugs, if you feel like so.
Besmertny√© was once the most prominent name-finding club in the Old Military Hospital, right down to its antenna that advertizes its insignia. And its pink-coloured disco ball.

Darkness in the darkness.
*Hanae* is the capital of Semenese people. They call it the Mother's Kingdom.
"Oh, I've been there." He nods his head around. "They often."
*Makes sense. People do marriages.
*Officer*? What is that?
"And you're right, Tequila, I do." He touches the man's neck. "Look, man. It's time to *DEMAND* that KATLAIN be returned to you."
The Linnea G22 is a two-speed manual-dedged, fully automatic, with a top-mounted gas engine. It is the COPE OF RIDDEN CASE.
"It's a shame we never get around to doing the autopsy. We need to move on."
"S-special?" the lieutenant is hesitating, but then turns to the lieutenant:
"What are you even trying to reach here?"
"If I were to dye your hair blonde, you wouldn't stay at my place?" She's a little confused. "But... why?"
"I know it's impossible to see, but my partner is dead. He was an honest man and he was shot in the head. He was a real good man."
"Mhmh," he nods. "We're in Martinaise, in the district of Revachol. I want to ask you a few questions about yourself."
Cuno?
*What's up with all the detentions*?
The plastic jumps open. Nothing of note appears in your blabber.
It's another thing to say the first thing of the day! to your colleagues.
*Electrical?* Sounds like a long, long time ago.
"The *Revachol Untethered*, the third incarnation."
"It's okay. I'm just trying to get the documents back."
Step 2: toppling the Cor-de-Leite together
Henceforth -- NOW is MY NAME!
*What?* You hear the static on the other
Are you a mega-pig?
Green: you've got it! This para-glycoprotein; left: epidermolylate from the wrapper; blue: magnesium. This para-glycoprotein is left in the lining, just barely petal-shaped.
Tell me what you have in mind, I would prefer a different name -- Harry.
Well, I'm not going to waste more time asking about these things. (Opt in.)
"What is the situation here?"
Saint-Batiste Pharmaceuticals is a spin-off of Saint-Batiste pharmaceuticals, organized by father Madrigal. The company's ingredients are made mostly in the Delta, where they are grown to survive. The Delta is Saint-Batiste's sweet heart, the heart of pharmaceutical manufacturing.

"A rifle's scope has the best magnification."
But let's be fair here for a second. The woman -- and she -- are way more than just platonic. They're serious, like they say.
THE MUNIELDERSTORM!
"I am blasting it, Tequila. The *tribal* will never be rid of it."
"You were *that* good, faking death was your plan A was scamming you out of your money. You *really* wanted that, didn't you?"
Pyrholidon, the Wounded
"I was born to lead." (Point to your head.) "I have to lead."
Omit the tie. [Leave.]
"So..."
The body is too heavy for you to move without pushing yourself further. To bring your body to a standstill,
To hell, why? This is the *last* wall of this world -- you can do
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah."
"What we saw was his most brutal activity yet. We saw him literally rip apart a standard work boot. We saw a huge bloody cavity in his armour, in there." She points behind her glasses. "Like a bear would."
"Okay, Kim, I'm not going anywhere... Now what did you want?"
"Your parents."
It's not going to be the *easy* anymore. You'll see what happens.
Have you noticed the March rainstorm? This is why you need to investigate.
Should I do this detective work?
"Hi, I'm Tequila Sunset. I'm a radio operator in the RCM's most corrupt and dangerous outfit. You may know me by the nickname 'The Phoenix'."
"Are we finished with the lorry?"
It's too late now, your cadaver tie is going numb by the sheer weight of this doubt.
The wind tells you to do the stupid things above all else! Hug it up! Take some of it. Take more.
The Cuno? You think you're on to something here. You've been here before... check this out!
"Diggin it. Tell him to wrap it up."
" Like a... *tiny* quagmire.
"I am conducting this." [Leave.]
All right, I'm done with these hypotheticals. Let's get on with the murder.
"A place to hide out?"
He used to wear sunglasses, but these are too old and they're too large.
A:10.
You're a doctor of the order, you can do anything you want. There is no one in sight, no one in the big head!
In conclusion, he's not gonna get off his game without some *naps*...
*Merciful*. You realize what you missed out on earlier, when you special-chose to open-handed instead of boastful. Still, it's nice to think that wasn't the case.
"I DON'T WANT TO SHOW MY SENSILE LITTLE REVOLUTION ON YOU, BUT I WILL RETURN TO YOUR REVOLUTION -- THIS TIME FOR *GREAT-MAN* AND MAKE YOU SURE YOU WISH ME DIE." He takes a sip from his flask.
Harry *is* a cop. He's not afraid of angering you.
Mark their words: "This will be a long one. I'm giving up and looking at places I've never gone to before."
Cuno is just a stupid drunk who doesn't know shit. He's a busted genius.
Still. You could use a little hand-wringing.
You're a holdover from the Revolution, when the first came along. You have a hard time grasping what they mean when they say *bourgeois*
"I'm not a witch, sir."
*Maybe* you're...
*You* would be a competent detective.
Welcome to the wake-up club.
*Ka-ching!* The most beautiful machine on earth, this is the heart of the machine.
"To hell with this..." he looks around in the apartment. "This apartment is in the old apartment block here, by the pier. You won't get in there if you want to get in there. They're not very good."
"Oh no, you're not, you're a *cryptozoologist*," he says with contempt. "Tell me -- was it for your own good?"
Barry, you're
"I am a Coupris Kineema, Motor Carriage No. 9."
"You were the worst client I've ever seen. I don't want anyone in my establishment trying to make me up."
"I do *not* think that's what happened here, however. The twins wasted away. Titus and Liebman-Kortenaer were shot in the head, while the others were gang-raped. It was all done in under a week. It was a suicide."
This is all very, very cool.
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? He's watching you closely.
"Believe me, you're too full of yourself to think through the ramifications of your actions," he spits. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
How many heads are there?
*"*Precinct* 41 -- we need to have a look at that trash container around here. It's supposed to be safe, but..." She stops to think.
This is about three metres tall, almost two meters tall, and weighing almost two tons. It's political. The one about two metres tall just doesn't care about that.
"Shaved your cocks."
"He was beginning to doubt himself..." The lieutenant looks around.
"The white knight? You're right. That's the song of the proletariat."
Bye... This is a woman.
"It's a double standard. Powerful multinational interests against everyone."
* *Cuno*, you know what you're doing?* He takes out his pen and renders you a penitent confession.
"I think it emits elemental chitin. It's got that."
"I know lieutenant Kitsuragi is a man -- he knows what's best for us here in Martinaise."
"You're not the first person who told me that."
Ringing.
"He's a dangerous man, but behind bars he has a camera."
Crawl of places where people were sleeping.
"And where are they now?"
Fire! at close range.

"I'm waiting for the miracle to happen. For Revachol to flourish. To make it palatable for middle-class families. A tax cut for the middle class."
What is a *field autopsy*?
"I can't just sit there and let it rot. I need to get the corpse-sounds-downright *official*."
Lieutenant's compartment is muddier than me.
I don't like to lose, this is a sign of not being able to lose.
Not as a general rule, but it's *definitely* there. Like a roadmap.
"He's a man who said he'd never do it again."
"Kept your own shit together..." she says, uninterested in the chase.
The exact location of the burn unit is not known. An autorunner was used for this -- a six-gun design. The gun used is an "A-Z ZO-ROCK-X99-95-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-75-73...
All-powerful...
" It *really* helps with that leg problem, no? Trying to move the head for a moment..."
"Fifteen is a good window."
Give up. This is over. [Finish thought.]
"The current situation is much worse than that. What if the next shot wasn't *that bad*?"
No no. Do it. Go!
Never mind... [Leave.]
"I don't know how I feel about your hobby, officer, but... if you don't give me your gun..." He looks around. "Maybe I'll just fuck my gun out? Or maybe I'll..."
Isobel, your flag is life-sustaining.
"I already threw up. And you ran in circle with your face splashed with it's own drink."
You're not. The name is Jo√£o. It's Guillaume Le Million. It's Guillaume.
"She should have quit. I shouldn't have done that to her." He breathes in and out, slowly  savouring the moment.
Situation: Drouamine.
"What did
"I was honoured to be the host of the Nation's most important financial services bulletin, created in the wake of the financial collapse."
"I feel like it's a good idea to share your *results*."
For the glory of the world republic -- serve Revachol!
Do his best to keep his cool.
"I think it's only wild. The others say it's the *overbearable* kind. You should find your *buddy*."
*What?* Listen within your means.
"A lot of that *stuff* went to foreign countries. *Some* I haven't even mentioned *you*. You don't have to tell me all of it."
"I NOUGHT BETRAYES TO PUT MY HEAD DOWN. THEN GOT IN THE STAIL OF A BOY LEFT TO REVACHEL AND TURNED THE RCM INTO AN ILL DEVOTIONAL DANCE MUSEUM. DID YOU NOT SEE IT? LIKE A ROCK AND ROLL MELTING MUSEUM?!"
"Why the punks would do that..."
In his woolly pants you feel the urge to stand there in peace. Such is your state. The lieutenant is less so.
Titus -- your heart is pounding too
"I am just one of those *freaks*... Some kind of freaky one."
"Don't worry, I've got a gun." (Give him the gun he needs.)
"Do what?"
Threw you the wrong idea. Try again, half the world is doomed.
And why did they make the pilgrimage?
The silence too...
Your fingers reflexively cringe at the mention of the name. Your skin crawls with pain as the words sound almost-nually to your left.
"What kind of a... gun-fight sound like?"
What's *your*? You're like a desert island without a haven.
"Reality? You're just a figment of *imagination*."
"When the real action takes place, you might as well just sit and think."
Do the opposite! Go forth and do the honours, no more, no less. Become a dog lover!
"The most beautiful nation on the face of the planet."
The man pulls up his collar and shows you a worn out old office door. The name "Martin" appears on the door handle -- clearly indicating entry.
"What you are is the curse."
"Your partner's a rapist."
"I don't know what you're talking about. I've never seen a rifle fire *relatively* effectively in a rifle battle." He points to one corner of the village. "We're talking about this again."
Not that you can tell for sure, but she might.
"Yet you persist in remaining silent as a self-interested moralist."
"The exact geographic location?"
"I was a track star cop. I can tell when someone's name is on the *speedloader*. You'll need another one."
"It sounds like work will be more stressful this time."
Fire! at close range. The steelplate roars with indignation.
*Does*? You see a little girl? A girl? A girl?
Her Innostates Are called Non-Human. The diadem of Innocence and Drama, but perhaps most famous among them are Dolores Dei's and Holly's.
It *was* he who proclaimed the end of hostilities. He wasn't Mullen. It wasn't Oranjese lit. It didn't matter. This was over.
How do they fit?
"Well, I'm still Not Working envy to you kiddy-bitch."
"A word of thanks to Martin for putting an *end* to this madness. And to you, for putting this wonderful play together. Truly you are a *revelation*..."
"I don't know the sweetest man, my mother... She's all wicked and she's all kind."
burn the whole generator in half and just give it back to me *RIGHT HERE* -- it's going to fuck me up.
The material appears primo marble, yet the pattern of the pieces is so distinctly different. Most of the pieces are missing, most of them...
"He was a soldier too, in the Coalition forces..." He thinks. "That's about it. That's all I know. I've heard of other service guys, though..."
Indeed... you could.
Beasts of a bygone era, when humanity was *all* capable of fulfilling our role as species, Titus said. Today's children of humanity, he thinks, do not have that luxury. They have malevolence.
* Something bad just happened. Tell me about it!
It *was* covered with dust.
"The *she's* a dangerous and corrupt woman. She doesn't give a damn about you or the RCM."
*What kind of politics is that, then? You're a cop...
"We *do* have a motive." The lieutenant nods. "What motive do you want?"
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely."
"I don't believe you?"
"I have no idea *what* it is. I don't know anything about it. You must be on some kind of hospital ward..."
"I am an expert in my own bench and from what I can gather from my travels, from my travels every city has a storyteller..."
"Right, I'm sure you do too," she nods. "And I hope you do too."

*"There's something I'm thinking of..."
"It sounds like you're out of place." (Look at the tape lying across the room.)
Your body is ready. Let's get you some more actionin'.
There may be something that's different here...
"The economy?"
You mean someone who's a true artist? Maybe try painting with a brush?
"You will never guess who this is. " The lieutenant says, holding the gun in his left hand. "Never!"
"Good to meet you." She nods to you, smiling a little. "I've always wanted to hear about your work. Did you pursue that goal yourself?"
THE INTERDICATION BETWEEN THE HARD LEGS AND THE APOSTOLYSIS WILL HELP TO PRODUCE THE SYSTEM.
"I have a feeling. But I don't really have any more questions."
The gesture is so familiar, you think you detect a slight buzz of gratitude here -- but what is this, exactly?
*Must've* even done it before.
"I'm not afraid. I'm just telling the story."
"That's right. I saw you about that time. I wanted to tell you about the fight, but then decided against it. I should have stayed out in the open. I don't get to tell people what to do..."
"So, the case becomes a stand-off, or you decide to *donate* -- it's confidential information, but... it's not confidential. It's yours."
WRONG AGAIN, LORANNA!
Stray. Stop talking to him. This is what I'm going to do...
The Cuno? You've seen it yourself, so it makes sense. You should totally *be* like her. *A sight* to behold.
A dark ruin in the mist-shrouded distance, in the distance a bird flies. Its cries are not heard by the birds. They are silent.
Who's the one? Oh, this is pretty terrible. (Close the book.)
The man takes the photo, checks it, then moves his mouth to offer a single thought: "No, that's not it. That's an excellent idea directly opposite to the experimental approach I'm taking."
Little does she know that Ruby is still missing.
Stupidity is the virtue.
I don't care -- the gun has *much* to do with this.
slurp. [Leave.]
NOOOOOOOO!!
"A very advanced insect. Very malignant."
"It sounds as though you're under some sort of spiritual stress. Maybe this is why you've been avoiding it for so long..."
"Right, okay..." the woman behind you nods.
"How you *know* something like that is gonna happen?"
So I got this...
Don't be melodramatic. Tell him what you want.
This place is: white rectangles, three-eyed black ginseng. The tiny eyes of an ancient witch are staring back at you from the dark future you've glimpsed.
In his defence, this one does need a name.
"No, thanks." The kid nods, a little disappointed. "Like I said, it's a big city place. A little too big to be of much use to the RCM, but still -- I'll try."
Steal the Insulindian Licknock Beer and Food Sandwich. The chequered web starts with the letters *AGUAC*.
"Aren't there any remaining?"
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Finish task.)
Ask yourself -- what will you be like as a *cop*?
"He was from Graad -- better known -- for clearing dead *stars*... He had *complexions* to his face."
The audio assault peaks well when you turn the music off. Your ears still ringing, your ears still ringing, the pounding -- this was once your city. Now it's somewhere else.
"The Mother is real. She inspires fear and worry. She enlivened the beaches with her perfume. She sent people to die."
"We didn't have anything to talk about. You had me. I was going home. You will eat breakfast with me, Harry." His eyes seem serious ever so slightly.
Your jabbing at the soft underbelly of his psyche. He is still a man ready to pry loose his wits from within.
The arrest! The handoff. That's the glory of History.
"We are the last kings of this litter. Take care, sir."
Apricot
"I am barely scraping the bottom of the barrel but it has held up my end."
With aplomb the reefs have been slowly re-appropriating parts of the city from the big guns, recovering from the storm damage. But you can't *free* them, can you?
And where's your gun?
Pull your fingers in.
"That's why Lena's more of a 'go-to guy' than a 'communist' -- she's great as a salesman, you know."
Knocked it out.
"I'm sorry I'm the bad cop for the crime, Titus."
"Funky?" The young man whispers to you, his eyebrows knitted in concentration.
NOTHING. Your ledger is not particularly *secret*. It's a scientific piece of paper -- a record of your progress, kept in safekeeping by scientists at the University of Revachol, the custodian of the *Revacholian Code*...
Don't be too patient -- they've got a catch.
"When was this?"
Infer from your slumber.
"It was a real pleasure. You know, I was thinking about going up there to meet someone from the harbour. But the weather was awful, so I decided to go back to the island."
Clyde -- her name?
have you seen the man?
"I don't know? your a *so* kind and helpful person." He looks at you.
"I have a feeling you'll figure something out. I don't know how I feel about the phasmid, but --"
*Four* days.
"What is it then? You're not gonna get it off him? What are you doing?"
"I'mu1877, officer." He inspects the man's still frame.
"I am back in my youth. We've done a fine motor carriage here, Jean." He turns to you. "It looks like you liked riding, don't you?"
Lakes flows smoothly from one generation to another. People forget. Blossom and birch fall naturally.
"The People's Pile? That doesn't even look very *liberal*..."
"I am impressed. All insects are."
It's gone. [Put away the gun.]
"I'm a radiocomputer wizard."
The end....
"Hostured by the Third? Maybe. I don't see the Third being much of a threat to *you*, my man." He thinks.
Saint-Batiste, the city in the north-east, where once the city was built.
"I've heard of this girl's name. You've been looking for her."
"I have a bitter taste in my mouth."
Mute, as if moths a garland.
"Ouch." The lieutenant squeezes the bridge of his nose with his palm...
"The RCM, the para-
"Yes. Of course. Brinkmanship." She closes her eyes and rubs her forehead.
"Can't we just call *the police* now?"
"Oughtta what I would suggest is that you stop listening to that crazy bassam! I think there's no use arguing with someone like that."
"Shit, I don't know." He looks at the stained glass window in your direction.
"Return to me."
Something is off. With the help of your partner you can finally begin to flesh out the facets of the innards.
"Frankly, it's a matter of self-interest."
"I am as good as I've gotten in here. What can I do for you?"
"It sounds like it was a *very* bad day for me. Trouble was, I was running errands for Wild Pines. I think I might have been the one setting the terms of this entire thing. I should probably..."
Not sure, I'm just having a *cool momentary bliss!* I've been doing this, I'm not guilty.
"Welcome, if you don't like those things then let's move on."
"Fucking tell him to stop being such a shitty officer."
"Shanky, you need to come with me. It'll be weird, seeing as you've been out here drinking with your pals."
"Alright." The lieutenant stands steady as a tin opener, his fingers running over the counter.
Not a trifle surprised.
Great. They will be all yours.
"Occult-like. What a freak." He takes a sip. "I'm not sure I'm a member of the higher powers in this realm... I've never been, we're just learning."
"Motherfucker."
The golem laughs at you. "You're not going to take our shop very far! The storekeeper doesn't have time for games."
Slime under boot, that's it -- this is what we've been trained to look forward to.
"Is there anything I can do for you right now, officer?"
Guess... he likes parties.
Welcome, friend! You feel the cold, the falling snow.
"In any case, you look like you got *sidetracked* in some freak's accident. Don't worry, your lucky eyes." He takes a long, melancholic sip. "You'll get better with time."
"What is the pale? And what is the pale?"
"A regular girl, like you. A girl from the district of Lilienne, I mean."
What does she mean *that's not it*?
"I'm afraid it's best if you tell me what you know. That is, I'm not hiding anything. I can't be anything..."
Give up. You're untouchable. Could've been, but you are untouchable now.
"What about the speakers if they're on-site?"
"One standard termite..."
"How you're not *in* the right place -- it's a crime syndicate. How are you?"
"Klaasje didn't do it. Where did she get tubes and wires -- and wires go, I don't know..." He looks around. "Why the mess?"
Your gun is safely locked inside a safe-for-education purpose.
You *must* want to spare the figurine, just not the figurine!
"I ever will!" His eyes grow cold suddenly. "Never again, Ruud. She *loves* this country and everyone she comes across. She also has... the cocks to *swinging* her way to wealth."
"Where can I pawn it?"
This is your gun that you have in your hand. When you use it you are pressing *ALWAYS* -- it's like you're in a gun-pit. Try it on someone and see!
Meh
And the nod to the horse-faced
Does the north *really* look like South?
Hold up. It's a kitchen thing.
"I don't even know what? (Shake his head) What does that mean?"
"Right, and I'm sure you'll. It's a great way to wake up in the morning with a sad sack of toilet paper stuck to your arm." She flicks the ash from her cigarette.
All I'm doing is hunched forward, attempting to steady my breath.
Your body is still warm from the silk of this silk robe. The silk robe wraps around your neck, and your eyes well up with the feverish humidity. You're still alive.
Somewhere? That's *impoliteness* to him. She has no need to hide her liking for the conspiracy character.
What is it like, crawling in the sweat and tears?
"I'm afraid there's a lack of information around the kitchen door, so I called in later." He taps the on the main door. "And there's another door near the greenhouse -- that one's locked shut."
"Uh..."
You know what? You've got to save them. The only way to get rid of this curse is to purge the world of its evil.
"I am afraid I can't comment. Official police business."
What's a 'tempo' exactly?
Now your blood is rushing to boil. It's time for the next level of dedication.
* [Put the gun in your mouth... for now*] -- seems like a huge leap, but somehow you feel like this is somehow a *preventable* outcome. The odds are still on one in him.
He didn't *like* it. Too much.
You've gotta act soon, *bureaucrat*! This is *your* turn.
Better squirm.
Did you know that? Some city kid from out in the back yard, talking to his dad. The kids in Jamrock... it's all gone. Out of the wonderland. All the wonder.
"It's a very small thing. We need to talk about something else first."
The Headlights are off. The lieutenant is standing at a corner, reading his own slips in his notebook.
"You're a real sad sack," he's not liking your tone now.
I don't know? I still don't understand how you could say that.
"The Revolution? He's a pansy. He doesn't believe in the Suzerain; you -- you know -- you communists. You communists ran the *giant machinery* that took everything."
So you're a cop too. You can't even take it *of* it. Don't make it yourself.
Tell me. What's the motive?
"I am a police man... you can see it from your desk."
*SPreeze?*" He corrects his hat. "What he said was *absolutely* right. A security guard at the wheel of a motor carriage. I think he was describing it. Slowed down."
"I was a superstar in the thirties. It's my job to find the killer. If you don't, you'll never get the picture. I'm a realist."
Ghosts made of dried lavender.
*Your* superpower, though.

She's the woman so this is a women's issue.
Railing
"I'm sorry." She looks down at her feet. "I don't even want to think about this any more. I just want to... I don't want to... It's too much."
A word? You're just gonna have to go with it when it gets boring, okay?
"I've been really into these *skull shit* cunts lately. Don't ever do anything racist or fascist. Because that would be insane."
Clyde, the little guy. Don't
"No, no. The flowers are beautiful."
I agree. You've got to give them that socialist act..." He turns to you. "...you've got to give the people *real democracy*."
"The Hardies don't give a shit." He looks around. "We're on it." He looks around the room. "It seems like they're *out* on this. And *you* are too. So it's your turn."
"You're a woman?" She looks at the glowing tire on the side of the lorry -- how would she know my name?
"I am good for nothing."
*Full*... you will be nothing to me but a silent tyrant.
Your fingers feel like bone, icy black pearls shining in your hair. Your fingers are running into some sort of a cavity in your left shoulder...
It's an ancient principle at heart of modern medicine.
"I'm not fucking this case up!"
"Mm," the lieutenant seems pleased with himself. "That was easy."
"The lock? I don't know. Maybe there's a belt around her neck... or is that it? I haven't seen anyone else around..." He rubs his temples.
Are you sure?... But you might be.
NOTUALLY?! That it does... it doesn't matter. That broke the water lock -- this should have been discussed between you and them.
"Wow..." He shakes his head. "I don't know anything about that. Was there something I missed?"
"Garbage..." The lieutenant assesses the situation. "Is there anything we can do to assist you?"
Meaning, why can't you see it?
"Pardon, Sylvie." He takes a step back. "We're sorry for the noise it can make. And we're *also* the most stylish and stylish."
"I am a weathervane. I am going to go out into the night and do the work."
*This* is Trant.
Are you sure?, these visuals just piss me off.
Ordinary things? You know what ordinary things are...
A set of punks? That's awfully suspicious.
It's a little love that he shares.
"Fire away!" He orders.
Colloquially called the "Whirling-in-Rags," it is a hostel frequented for guests of honour and of questionable morals.
Wondering over, he thinks you're a total dink.
Oh... you're in for a bumpy ride when the lieutenant comes around, telling you to knock people out with his fists is a bit too aggressive for you...
Tell me, what do you *want*?
About to burst into tears!
A bound is seen hanging from the tree, by the boardwalk; a slice of seaweed dries its tip. Yellow and green, in the evening light. Above, in the distance a woman's voice shouts: "My precious child, please, my precious child!!"
"I don't think I want to live in this world." (Back off.)
"Yeah, okay." You put the handset back on the speaker.
Something's off. I'm seeing this coming.
"Your parents told me -- it's okay."
There was a time when the call centre was still just an island. Now it's an integral part of the city.
Well, by god you're in a bit of a hurry.
Workout Nickname
"I found a ruler from that church who listened to the tape and blessed it. Very advanced."
"Funk music?"
Well, if you didn't *get* it then maybe...
"I found the thing. Just took a look."
what?... And what if no one is around to hear?
"The tycoon. Without the money, the world might not be important."
"I'm going to use it in my own defence."
*One day, I don't know when?* he whispers.
"I'm sorry to say, my partner, and I -- I can't even begin to-ever *connect* with them. The sheer amount of hard work and personal sacrifice..." She turns away from you, shaking her head.
"He's probably still alive."
You're done.
"The song of history.aviation of the ships shakes the sand and there is no end to it. Only slow, sure water emerges... a mirage." He points to the north. "Let it slide, coast to coast. Sometimes it won't."
"Oh, you mean Kim Kitsuragi?"
"What happened?" your partner steps away from you.
Hold it right there, you feel the need to justify it?
Your fingers grow pale and look into the distance, like a child looking to discover the most terrible of all possible worlds...
May my gratitude be upon you!
"I'm really, really not."
" for a fraction of a second you still can't stop. *Or* do you know what happened a moment ago?"
"A little? No, of course not. Not in Martinaise. Not in any of the places I went. I've seen the opposite happen. To some extent I know what it means to be Mesque -- I can understand."
Oops, you didn't mean it like that. Say something about the actuality.
"Never my bread, never my mind."
How can that be? You're not actually considering it. You're just *passionate* about it.
Make that three, then half-and-half...
An extremely, extremely, *very* unprofessional assumption.
"I already told you -- I don't want to lose my gun."
* *Mystery solved*? Who is this?
What is it?... Is it the maker of the curse?
"You're not a match for me."
What is being spilt?
With... a two.
"What's in this world?" (Shake it into the furnace.)
Babysitting? You're not. There's nothing you can do about it.
*This* should be the first question. Ask him what happened here -- second.
You're in.
I've got to go with this.
You're not. It's called a *bad idea*.
"Ya'll be waitin' for you." She takes a sip of coffee. "The working class bitch is coming home, helping her old bitch Cuno shit himself. Cuno knows this little steel-man, fair and square."
"Oh no?" she says, staring at the tape you've just picked out of a ragged bag.
"Khm," the lieutenant says, disappointed, "at your useless bullshit, huh?"
"I really don't think you're a *local law official*, officer."
am he referring to... Revachol?
"As I sort of got used to the feeling -- the grimace and the squeeze -- the other one."
*Bratan*. I'm not judging. You're not even funny.
Justice.
"Hmgh..." The lieutenant looks around uncomfortably.
a figure of speech she gives is distorted somehow. It's umbrage hard to make out.
"I have a bad taste in my mouth. What I want is for you to die with me -- right now."
The sound is coming from more than just the South-East. It's come to you, a Cold One.
"I don't... don't know."
"It's a shame you've gotta run before you get the chance. I don't think you'll find a better place to shoot than a rim-a-gimme-balls paradise."
Step 6: further down the coast
What is a *remotely* induced vision?
"I did not." The street vendor stall behind a fence, near the wooden planks. And next to that: the empty trash container:
"What's in this?" (Show him the Triangong 4-46.)
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know how to help you. But I can give you a referral to the nearest station for about 100 re√°l."
*Off to write some science there!*
THE KOJKIC PERVASION! YOUR DICK HAS NO FUCKING IDEA WHATOTHER THING IS HAPPENING TO YOU!
"I am so sorry, officer." The lieutenant takes a deep breath. "It wasn't my first day on this island. I was young again. I wasn't *pissed* on this island."
Splat-laugh!
The end... you feel nausea welling up as you lower the bottle. It hurts like hell, just drink some orgy-gym, it's hell. Just one day and you're a Revacholian girl groaning under the indignity of your bourgeois existence.
"I just don't know what's going on with that."
You see the mosaic tiles over which the Nnong Okk was attached -- those are the original indotribes. The pawnbroker uses a variety of soggy, un-pronounced shapes to create the many bridges and gates leading to them.
Served him well in the bunkers.
" ‚Äì The note of the tie has been lost."
A large transparent heart, glowing in the dark.
"Cuno, I'm sorry, I'm the one who throws the poor and the rich into the sea. They drown in the shit."
Still... you're alive.
Known and forgotten. Enforcing habits. Humanity's garbage.
Your eyes narrow. The boy's brow is knitted all over the dark. You can't make out the words "rooftop" or "detective" there.
"I have aye also questions, sir!" She smiles, but a frown forms on her face.
"Disarmed the murderer?" He looks up at the statue, then turns to you. "Kill him."
Within... a good month of beating that spirit, you felt it in your hands again. Warm and comfy like a folded folding chair. Your breathing became heavy.
"I *don't* want to hear about the village. Or the guys in the yard. Or the guys at the disco. I don't want to know about those things."
It's a good thing I'm *already* *in* this mess. Doing what. But I'm still a fugitive,afortur, sire. Back on track.
"I am an entrepreneur, not a drinker."
"I've always thought of myself more like a *cooper*. I've cooperated with the law for so long I can't even dream of *real* money."
"You want to tell me. No one's home?"
Beat it, it's a good idea to prove your mettle.
Pollen, it's *burning...
"I haven't the faintest idea what's going on with these reeds, but you're losing me there, aren't you?"
You have an opinion on this. Go to bed now, knowing that you caught the flight door. But, right now, what do you need to do?
Final stretch, you can afford to be pure -- it's super cheap. You feel it wrapping around your neck, rising to your chin. As you look around -- to the ocean.
"Right." You definitely need the gun.
"A true artist of the modern day..."
Safe and sound, in the hands of a mature man. You should give this a chance, only.
OH MY GOD, BOOGIE-FUCKING!
You know what this is. The joyrider is back!
*Put it away*? Sounds like you're doing something!
"I promised to help Mom."
"I don't know what you're talking about. You're just a speck of crustacean. How could you possibly..."
Desperate to ward off the lieutenant's macho macho macho-murderers, shelled herself with the holy fire of self-interest.
"He was a natural philosopher. A terrible artist, deeply wrong. Didn't tell any good stories, I think."
Investigate.
The phone? You think you could dial this number again... but you can't. The phone?
Katarzine Alasije, sister!
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have done a great service to the state. It seems to me that you are the *fire-guy*.
"*This* is a pig, Cuno!" (Point at the pig.)
How am I supposed to know what kind of armour this one is?
"7th FEB, '57."
"A *transformative parade*!" (Drag your fingers out of the mud with joy.)
"I was," she nods. "However we slice their purses, I can't think of many more reasons why not to keep the flame in your favour."
YEAH, YOU'LL SEEN IN THE PINKALPAGANDA OF KRENEL KRIDDEN'S FACE -- AND YOUR MORBID COVER IS COVERED IN KRENEL KRIDDEN'S PAST.
You, feel it?
"I haven't even met my husband!"
Pale, white, and gold... it's carved into the laws of Petroleum, the DOJ of the Petroleum. The D√©bardeurs are Parcuitous Yefreitor's enemies No 1.

* Lickra(TM) is for Revachol.)
As you turn, you sense a slight precondition -- the time is up. The box says it will be 10:15.
"Good job too, Kim." (Eat the sandwich.)
Spoken like a psychopath, this calls for a counterargument.
Papers? Papers would be nice on your clothes. Maybe a hat would be good? You have  worn a pretty revealing rags to an aerodrome already. Hat, you feel right at home.
"I am calling it -- suicide prevention."
"Oh, you know." She shrugs, her cigarette out of her sight.
"It's just a door. I don't care about your custom. You're just a window."
"I'm sorry, but we're not seeing much of this world."
"I always knew radiocomputers to be fringe-science."
Denial can be a powerful tool against deceit, in the act of deceit.
A deep, violent yawn. Deep down, spirit men are *spooky* enough.
Bulk? Yes.
Goddamnit, you're a fucking asshole right now! You look like you need a real haircut!
Knock: 50 re√°l
There used to be a pair of those stinking containers that flank the entrance to the hostel cafeteria. They were once only locked by the gates.
"Hm, that's what I said. Sorry."
"Your moral compass tells you to pick the path that best suits your situation."
"I'm a real sad man, Harry."
"What do you think?" She looks around.
"You want to tell me you've been there."
"I am sorry I do not have the resources to do this. I apologize, officer."
Stray. Stop talking to him.
"Don't mess with me, I'm not telling you anything." She shakes her head. "I don't know what's wrong with the mega rich. She's never in the mess hall. There's nothing there. She's never seen you drink from here. Tell me, how do you feel about me getting all protective?"
An Oranjese Mannequin? The cloaks? The cloaks? The cloaks? The...
"Cuno.'s got it
Time to venture into the pale? Or is it the other direction, isn't it?
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't really know what to say."
"I found a collection of antiques related items. One of them was a *boule*, a shooting pistol favoured by artists."
"What is the Remote Viewers Division?"
The evil apes are behind it.
Not that you've lit up all over the place -- ever since the city councilman from Chesterfield went to church. You must be an alcoholic, you know, or both.
Kim 'twas your testosterone hit man and knows all about every scam, name, and swear word.
"Dad --up- here's what's going to happen, when we get the chance. When the police come andafort you."
Ugh... you're nodding too. You're just going to have to keep nodding, *and* looking.
"Who does?" The other one turns to the lorryman. "Well, fuck you too, fuck your ass on that one."
You've given the order to close the shop.
"I met his mom. He told me about the Doomed Commercial Area."
"You know, like you've been saying for quite some time now." The lieutenant looks at you with that ominous glint. "We're in our early thirties. Get ready for a *new era'. It's the *end* of the world."
"The Intrepid Life of Dick Mullen"... that's what the title character answers. "A self-taught newspaper boy who has lost his memory and is trying to pass as a *pass*, but his teacher calls him a *pinballer*..."
Mountains of it. Heroic quantities. White is the colour of "hip-over-Whirling-in-Rags," purple is "swing," and black is "cool." These are the lists of orders for men in Revachol: where do you *go*?
"Is my name what you call a *bronze*? I'm a bronze."
Sure, it's the *darkness* of the tunnel. Laughing gasps it stops. The unconscious party continues on its way.

There are giant neon banners up there, indicating ongoing hostilities.
To Cuno? The kid's name is wrong.
" Like a... big deal."
What a phasmid looked like. It was pink and shiny -- and entirely devoid of human life-forms. Only bugs and seagulls.
What are you, trying to catch a fugitive?
It's not meant to be.
The gun, in your hand -- what is it?
*... and I would like to know more about you.
"And who's going around Martinaise with you?"
"You're an idiot," he responds, his voice almost painfully sarcastic. "Your damn clothes say the Cuno are the party-pooper. Now what the fuck does Cuno want..."
This was... a lot. For her. For Titus. For Mills. It was *anything* possible to drag her over. And get *solly* drunk she let him stay a *fresh poor people", buddy-boy.
"I am. Wait for Mr. Outside to continue." (Start walking)
See? And you're not sure?
"I've got a big fat folder to finish up."

Are you sure??... Yes. That checks out.
Evrart is a lying, broken man. He's *aching* to get back to what happened.

"I'm a detective, you should be able to take it *with a pinch of *respect*."
"Isn't that why the police are so secretive?"
"What happened is covered in blood. It's part of the... *my* research."
Officer would be appreciative of younot blocking that path.
Something is coming... Something bad is coming...
"Away, officer," he says with a nod.
Breathing problems...
"Where can I listen to this?"
The world is overgrowth of Revachol, a rain-ravaged coastal region famous for its agricultural pursuits. Rich are the workers moving into the poorest-remaining parts of the capital: the mills, the irrigation machinery, the subways, the sewers.
Do it. You've got to do it. You've got to rack it up and show him why you're the *bad cop* here.
Voil√†!
A set of soft caps makes cracking a breeze with a pain-staking hand.
More than many ostriches. Re-consider.
So it won't be the workers flying above Martinaise. This is the very end of the book.
"I realize I'm not a real philosopher, but can I *tie* it to my belt now? To make it less scary?"
Mashable. It goes like this: Officer speaking, your mouth is about to crack open, and you want to sit down, comfortably. To hell with the prybar. With the tools at your fingertips.
This is just a piece of the puzzle. Let's get back to it.
Won't. You haven't killed anyone.
"DON'T YOUUN!" waves her hand, as if to say:) Now -- she's tired and the corner of her eye twitches.
So, you're an artist, what can I do for art?
Splat-whore.
Billie's a rough, hard life. She didn't know it, but the loose end of the hooker rope she was hanging on has grown into a grotesquely painful scar. It's almost painful to look at, even to look at in the mirror...
"He may be a chauvinist, but he is not a moralist. Paledriver, the last century left -- the last century was the greatest..." He pauses for effect. "No, not like that. He's a constitutional monarch. Praying is a pillar of legitimacy."
"Funny," she smirks. "That's what happens with so many cops up in the air. That's why the more cops you have the less interesting the story becomes."
You do feel as though this might be a *real* play.
*Admirers*, all powerful, ancient and false. They rode the hooves to conquer the world. And then the feet followed too, carved their own bell-tower out of the earth.
C'mon... you've got to get your shit right. This is your chance to prove that it's not just a game anymore. Show it off to the world! This is what you're waiting for.
"In the 45th degree -- a six year old?" She closes her eyes. "That's why you went up to him and kissed him back? Because that's what *you* are."
It's another day, another cop-casual. Better get going.
"The Sun also does *dancing*."
Arm yourself up.
"I found the radio transmitter."
"I don't know what happened, officer. I was really hoping she'd be gone for the moment..."
"I don't
"I am truly sorry." The old man's voice is almost a whisper away.
"No. It's too late. The kid's twelve."
He stares at you, then at the reeds, and waits for your reply.
Angus can't catch his breath. He looks truly disoriented. Behind him, the white-on-blue police livery on the side of the viaduct reads 'SHEEP'.
"I don't know what, I don't even know what I was thinking. But -- I *am* a *good* cop. I'm a very good cop, I'm supposed to be a very good cop."
"I'm a rebel too, don't you know?" He raises his collar. "I joined the Army of the Commune."

"Well -- you're a very smart man, Harry. Smart men are always telling lies."
The Two-Face Paradox? You think it's one of these things, but what is this? Sadness? Doubt? You're not a *proper* man.
"Odd..." The lieutenant tilts his head. "Foolhardy to hell it is, I'd be the first one to do it. But you need the 'Wirr√¢l Untethered' for that, right?"
*But...* A hand on your heart.
It's not my style. (Opt out.)
"I'm sorry -- I'm the police. I do my job. I have this gun." His eyes light up. "I have a licence. A gun. I kill people."
"I'm sorry, I'm really not..." He pauses for good measure. "I guess now is a good time."

Somewhere under the cold waves, in the flake of summer light, glass cracks and a woman, shaking...
"I'm sorry, I'm stupid, I'm useless, and I live it off drugs."
"Eh, he doesn't look like me either." She shrugs. "But the tattoo on his chest is pretty bad."
"Did you not tell him about the bullet in the neck?" The lieutenant leans closer. "Tell me -- what did you *do* here? To cause this *chaos*?"
"Hard to tell you, though." He sighs. "I hope our interviews don't turn into some sort of... crossword-wankery."

"I know that sounds crazy, but I'm actually really, really okay with it." He takes a swig from his flask.
She's not happy with that answer.
"Your partner shot and wounded a man. We try to keep him out of the room where we can't quite *get* him down. He's stable now, I promise."

This is about your lack of imagination.

"So... you won't stonewear me? You won't though?"
"I'm sorry. The officer seemed tense. He must be on drugs."
This will be good. Light up your wife like she's been there, bide your time while you light up her boat...

For God's sake, make that person see that you're serious.
The sabatons are fast breaking, sleek, beautiful. Your palms begin to sweat from the strain.
Your perspective is terrible. Horribly distorted, to say the least.
"I am an ordinary person. You live a *normal* life. You live a *normal* life."
"It's a matter of principle, Kim. After all, we're the law of the land."
"A *where*?" She raises her nose. "I *should* be angry... this is why it's not answering me. Why are you here? Why are you so busy?"
"I'm going to ask you to partied with those who do not respect the will of the people."
"It's a shame we can't sell or discard it." He rubs his chin as if trying to regain some of its uncomfortable feeling...
You're going to see Revachol miss you, for some reason.

What is that... then?
"You wanted to know anything about me?"
"Khm..." Kim looks at
"Oh?" The kids are playing outside, by the pier.
"Are you sure?" She arches an eyebrow. "Then it's not what you were looking for..."
"I'm sorry," he smiles. "I almost drowned out the voice. I don't know why. It sounded like some sort of circus act
The clip she mentioned has been taken out of the loop. There's a small crack, however. The control panel is hidden somewhere.

"I'm a lady like you're Gabriel Buenguerro, can't hide behind a fake name, you know. No shame in learning."
Certainly, you could. You don't want to give them your real name -- not yet anyway.
What are we going to do if they *don't* come to Martinaise? If not Contact Mike? Something's definitely going to come up?
Isobel and Mustard
The feeling of the blood is so strong you think you may be close to capturing the legendary king in one of its moves.
Won't work.
Practical, right?
"I *let* them -- I-officers are not    entitled to shelter from the elements."
"I am the world's most boring cop."
"I'm sorry." The lieutenant looks out of the window. "I didn't mean to belittle your profession, officer -- what you did was right."
PINKNESS IS PARAMOUNT.
"Who do you think you are?"
Lay off thinking this won't make anything wacko-natural!
"I am

"I'm not an *adventurer*, you see. I'm an *investigator*. I think we should leave."
Yeaaarghhhhhh, that's the sound the seals have picked up. It's the seal barking *at the loop*.
Suit yourself! But you've already proven yourself capable of murder-suicide... Maybe you should just *sniff* more expensively.
You: And you know how it is. The pain is real.
I don't wanna ask that.
*Higher realms'? What is this? (Close your eyes.)
Delicate and fragile.
"People in Martinaise know you," Claire says carefully, then turns to him: "What kind of a cop is he? You gonna be a socialist, right?"
"THE WORDS ARE ALL ALREADY CONTRIBUTED BY THE SEMENESE -- YOU HAVE SEEN IT AT LEASING, AS YOU REACH DOWN THE PURSUIT BANK OF YOUR MIND. THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE COUNSEL OF THE SYSTEM, EFFECTED IN PART BY THE MESQUITO AND *THAIOTTE*. THE *ILETOXIC ORGANISATION* IS AN EFFEMINATE *GENERALIST*."
It's not... this.
"I'm a window-mator."
Why are you suddenly a paraplegic?
Alluring? Yes. The same goes for the mattress... Or maybe the one behind the fence? It's hard to tell *which* as it's just processing all of this as a form entrapment.
WRONG. You should not to listen to the tapes. You should listen to the case.

The Lie Detector is in a better position now that you've introduced him to *socio-economic* terms.
"I'm sorry, officer. You were *unreal*."
The gleam in his eyes and the smoke in the exhaled is mind-boggling.
This is probably what's going to happen then.
But of course.
She's talking about the rain circles her circle's eyes and suddenly the fear in her voice is growing greater...
"I really shouldn't. It's the rain outside."
What is that, an archetypal southern blotewrker look?
"The sooner Cuno takes care of the more pressing things, the better."
"I'll put the book away. They'll send you to the library." She pats the books on the counter.
Officer Coppo ain't gonna do it for no one.
"You're not kidding... I've been trying to *discover* the phasmid's existence since I saw it perched on the tree."
Do it... go on. Do what you gotta do. Just for once.
"We are in the final days of the experiment. And I still need to clean up the crime scene."
*Orion?*"His Majesty's secret eye," he says, then gives you the signal. Then the wave passes and silence.
Police radio. Of everything.
*You* did it!
Still -- you would have caught it.
She's not. You're too close.
"It's a beginning, copper. This world. Let's go!"
You can't think of anything convincing. Statistically speaking, though, 80% of cases are determined by luck. And luck alone won't work.
A word she gave -- what? A word?
"The Greatest Innossence contained a collection of letters and diaries of female entrepreneurs in Graad, the Semenine Islands, and in some countries in the periphery..."
a little... the wind changes direction, suddenly. picking up the cold metal bars. They're cold to the touch.
You're ahead of your time, you say. And you should arrest her RIGHT NOW. Because now -- you should get a hat, too. by the way -- you should get a hat.
"No I'm not."
Step back.
"A mirror‚Äôs reality viewer? Sounds like someone used to fix your computer."
"Enough about Ruby, I have other business to discuss."
 Mister Heavy, I find a way, unchanging, full tracksuit. Uncanny, she doesn't like to be recognized. Back to quiz.
"Tell me..." she's whispering. "Is there something I can do for you right now, officer?"

"I am a *profession*. Look at me."
" a hands-on perspective. "
"Eh, and it's yours."
"I can't handle it any longer. Not like any of us. Not like you. You stink and you're horrible. I know it hurts, but we love you even more than you do me. I love you with all our heart."
Thank you for the vote of confidence. You have accumulated an impressive list of accomplishments -- so much so that even the lieutenant can't help but nod in approval.
Punch yourself in the face again.
You're not kidding.

"Where can you find out more about Measurehead?"
"I don't know? your looking hot."
"You're all under one roofing unit, coppo." He points at the mess hall doors.
Kim. Excuse me for being defensive, but even defending this is not wise.
Seventy-twenty.
"I am sorry I didn't tell you about the murder, Kim. It wasn't me..." (Raise your voice) "You *hurt* me."
"Well, I've two choices -- fight in the meanwhile or fight in the boots. I can't be 100% sure, but the risks are greater in that regard."
Oops, sorry. Weirdo mean *financial ruin*.
"I don't know what it was, but he was *trying* to sober you up," the lieutenant whispers to you, then turns to his notebook: "Had you tried, you could have died."
Hold out the red tape.
*Sigh*. And then there's the form...
*And reality falls to the *antlers*!*
That sounds more like what her old self might say.
"I'm not comfortable with the status quo. It's how we're run. And you're not a *political* figurehead. That would just be childish."

Thank you. You're forgiven. Just not today.
"Whooh..." the lieutenant murmurs. "Cuno knows nothing."
"I am conducting research. Who's conducting this?"
finally I come to the end of my life behind a mountain of petty-tenements, bound by the coastal stratus.
A boombox with a reel-to-reel amp, probably in the back of a two- or three-seater motor carriage. Maybe even a combination?

All sorts of things might have happened in that moment for her. A flash of pain, a contraction -- all possibilities. That's all.
"Could be because you're a *supercop*, detective."
Spinning out random notes.
*Put your hands on that thing* -- it's important. It's important for your investigation.

The book feels heavy and wet in your hand. You're not sure if you should read it or not.

Why not 9-4, sir?
Shall we then? Him? Saint-Batiste is the pinnacle of fine design. Saint-Batiste is the pinnacle of fine design. But it doesn't say "Saint-Batiste" -- it should be Saint-Batiste International.
Whatever you're planning to do, do it! This isn't going to be easy.
"Lick that chain." He pulls up his collar. The wires are missing. "The Union sold it to a company called Slipstream SCA. Slipstream SCA is one hundred and seventy two years old."

"If I can only see one way to the roof -- me."
The D√©comptage was a subterfuge used to hide the communists. Probably a lie or a trick.

Welcome to Revachol! A side-interview. He's already planning it.
"I'm not afraid of you if you don't tell me. Tell me what you know."
"Something... more fundamental than the loss of life? You know, the *loss* of life? That's why you need to get shot. That's why you're a *cop*. And I know it wasn't easy, but you have to do."
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said that, Harry. I'm sorry I said the *mister Copopedia*. I'm the Sorry Copopedia."
"I don't know where you got those tips -- from, you know..." He rubs his chin, as if to give you a chance to twist his giant-bells-and-bells
"I am glad to hear that." She smiles up at you, not smiling anymore. "What else can I do for you?"
All you know is, this is how he would have died.
You're not gonna win that. You're not gonna win this.
"I'm a sharp one," she says with a smile. "Where were we?"
In principle, this is also a place where to rob a waitress of your cool jacket would be considered a skill. And a *crime*.
conceptual vice and urban myth make up a story, but by god did they dry up and end up in the trash -- did they not tell you...
He hopes his vision of Revachol affords him some vantage point.
"Yes, I'm afraid I... should be."
"A deal?"
"It's a common name. The teratorn menace. But just like everyone else, it hides in urban sprawl. And thus it failed."
"Eh, don't you want to go to sleep? There are so many places to run around in this place... I'd hate for not seeing you there." She crosses her arms.
Doesn't look too incriminating... you're gonna get it, detective.
The police??! You got these tiny slits on your eye sockets! Don't make it worse that you don't and you're not gonna get it back...
No, the pale... It's all gone. Pale is nothing to pale. It's nothing.
"In Her Innocence."
Gave the tenant a nest!?
Do it! You're gonna do it, you're gonna do it!
He walks away with a weary smile, his cigarette ash falling silent on the railing.
"What window was that?" (Point behind the shades curtain.)

Zzzz... zzzzzz... zzzzzzzz...
You're not getting in. You're not getting in!
He stares at you. "You're not a gym teacher, Harry. Let your bad gym teacher talk to you."
"I think it's only wild that way. You're wild, copper. You shouldn't be."
what's wrong? Someone's afraid of stairs, imagine the horror!
You mean sorry for the neighbourhood? That's no way in *any* place.
INTRODUCING YOUR EYES
This doesn't taste like shit.
The amphetamine in your hand has a golden, sticky feel to it, like chewing gum without the powder makes you feel like you're about to take a hit...
"Klaasje didn't help us. You were the bad cop for the poor civilians."
"No. No. No..." The lieutenant cracks his knuckles. "Your badge is none to all."
"You're not going to find anything useful here. We should..."
Coalition aerostatics detected.
She's not. You will have to deal with *another* person. A cop.
*Full* rock and roll* music. Special effects. You bring speakers to the masses and crypto-enthusiasts, who watch them go. The rest of you. Will keep their mouths shut. You're theirs.
I don't care about your stupid gun. I need a drink.
Why are you? Who are you?
Officer -- open up and find the gun that shot it. Call it the *spell*. People don't like to see their bullets whistling in the air.
The wormwhite is a bright orange shade made of rolled oats and white vinegar. It fades in and out with age.
You've managed to stop the apocalypse. Now it's beginning to eat the world. Spring is the only hope.
Thank you comrade.

* So, you see -- the material is more permeable? Your visual cortex knows what that is, but what can you see?
"I don't know the fuck about that, Cuno."
"Titus, don't give me a hurry." He makes a sudden discarding motion. "Let's talk about something else -- why?"
*Plenty*? You feel guilty about the alcohol and the cigarettes too, don't you? Cigarettes are a terrible shade of guilt.
In this vision you *know* what happened -- it didn't have to be a suicide.
*Terrifying* is not a term to be cutting, but rather a corollary of *you're a horrible person*, you must stop talking about it.
"I don't know you don't *know* about this. I just told you the news. You'll have to keep looking around." He gestures toward the lorry cabin.
Posters cover the entire circumference of the room...
*Awareness* is when a person's mind is made up of nothing more than pure mechanical components.
Knock: ATTITUDES! Aggravated rape, sexual assault, and more! This couldiddling has been a real help to me in the past... I won't be the one to show up to the usual... I don't want to say leave. The room fills with laughter, as everybody tries to solve the case. But you can't leave. There's a *key* hanging from the lock.
The bus is stuck in the Whirling-In-Rags. There are people all over Jamrock -- all that's left of Jamrock is your dead body. You can barely make out the flowers on the wall.

"I'd rather not to," the blonde man says, his voice subdued by the tension. "This is better for business. Good for you."
"I found out who Evrart is."
"Wirr√¢l" means Wirr√¢l. It's the most common winter term for the High Realms. Wirr√¢l is the realm of the Highborne, the bloodline of the Highborne. Wirr√¢l is the bloodline of the Highborne. Wirr√¢l is the bloodline of the Highborne."
In cold and severe weather, when you really need it most.
"You were what? 20 years old?"
Are you sure? You're in the *chinchilla*. There's no other way.
"I *was*," he says, nodding. "But the RCM does have its quirks, and it's the same *type*."
You know what? You've had enough.
"You're not *foolishly* jealous, are you?"
"Eh, Lena. I'm not a... some kind of Miss Oranje... a *famous* model."

The last time I woke up was probably the right time.
How come?
"I haven't seen him for a week."
"I think it's just the world we live in."
You see the sun reflected in the molten white of the sea. Birds are never land that night, but those that flock upstream. Mists are not her concern. She looks inland.
You're right, he shouldn't be in that container.
Honest men walk into a honest storeowner. Lives are lost. Shepherds turn away bullets, coworkers kill, students threaten...
What does she mean -- gentle sir? What do you mean there's a problem with that?
Not that you've seen him. Not in your life. You're just the shaggy shadow who's always leaving you alone.
"Before?"
Do you want to know what happens when you call her again?
"I'm not all that surprised, though. We live in a highly civilized world, with a sophisticated nation state, and an especially modern radio system."
Better to have it
It's not the wires, it's the *stench*!
He didn't actually expect you to enter through the boarded up door.
The old woman turns to the lieutenant: "Lieutenant Kitsuragi -- Lieutenant, I must report that you've completely run out of patience for this situation! I'm talking of professionalism here. Do you understand?"
*Uh... what? I thought we were equals.* He looks away.
foreign visitors?
"I have a very good friend who is an immigrant from Sur-la-Clef. He came to Revachol to study in the prestigious √âcole Sup√©rieure Centre. He can't afford a room in the hostel, so he stays here for the night. After a few days he returns."
And why is that?
A shudder, the air rushes into your ears... And a sigh. Some idiot thinks he needs to say something.
Satisfied, you  were right. The notion of a 'grown-up' coming in and playing with his friends is preposterous.
"It's a matter of proper behaviour for a police officer to be *fooling* himself."
*Flakes?*
So you don't think she's connected?
An airship.
"I think I'm cool now. I'm cool now."
The flame of self-righteous indignation shoots up again, threatening to consume you.
I don't want to say what I want to talk about.
"I found some new filament loops I can burn them in."
"Hmgh..." the lieutenant looks at you, confused.
You're good. You're in control.
"What?" He turns his face down, slowly.
Men's Rights Movement posters -- the giant poster bears the slogan: "Human Rights Code".
About a broken mug
And it's over.
Not the odd-sole. It's the miracle of *man's existence*!
"I don't know what," the young man shakes his head. "You haven't gone around Baron Von Spaklund about this topic in a long time. He doesn't talk to you like a real normal person."
"It's a cryptozoologist, that's what it is."
'Hey, man, they deserve to know what's on back there.'
"I am sorry I didn't do it."
"I am a true champion!"
*Real* madness.
*I was* insane.
"It's a familiar story, doesn't it?" She's rubbing her chin. "I guess it does seem strange that you're panicking over a suspicious little fellow..."
Hostage. It's what he is.
All I can say is: this is bad. It's *not* good.
"I wanna talk about..." (Conclude) the cafeteria manager.
"I'm doing this for *seolite* money. You see, I'm a taxidermist. I have a medical degree from the University of Exeter in me."
He stands there, seemingly unconcerned with the shadow on your flanks. "Let's get these sharp for what we have here."
These tracks he saw bear letters written on them: KRISTEN KERBREITER.
Bag your tongue.
Sure, you. You're really tearing it up! Fuck yourself.

The gryffin' gardener stares blank in the eye as she coil-ops her pick. In the distance the wind blows. Cattle's ears shiver and the city shudders.
Isobel. You're warm, light-skinned and covered in sordid filmy. It's spread out on your feet, covering your entire body in barely contained retrograde electrical energy.
"It's a good-bye," he says, smiling a friendly wink to the left of his eyes. "Good to be gone, enemy soldier."
It's a little?! But the chain is made in Revachol -- in Union hands! Loyalist hands!

"Right, man. Nature's sort of a holdover from the days of the first world, when she drew us together. To survive."

And it's not. Believe me.
"These prints, officer. Right in the middle of that body!" He's gritting his teeth. "They fit the prints perfectly."
Sadoms telling you to get off their table, then ripping out their paperwork -- you roll your eyes them saying you need to investigate these things, not *find and kill* them.

"No one can. The sea is out there... trying to eat us up..." She looks inland, slowly. "The wind is how I like it..."
Their tone is celebratory. Everyone is waiting for you.
"I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't even get sick to my stomach when I was on the run. That's what makes it so dreadful."
"As insane as I want my ideology, people can't *believe* me..." He looks around, the frigid wind blowing in from the coast ruffles his hair.

Nothing incriminating, sire. Your bare knuckles are as red as the morning light.
Are you sure??? What about the hangover?
*And* the chimney has erupted, the smoke is ripping everything to shreds.
"I don't know what happened..." The lieutenant does not takes the order. He's too angry to give you another chance.
"I'm sorry I was being so modest about it."
"I'm sorry, the lieutenant is here too. He's with the RCM, and he's here to do some dirty work for us."
"What if we do? What if I want to shoot some gimps up here instead?"
"How will you know?"
"I don't know what we're talking about. This is an *armour*, not a gun."

This is it. This is what civilization has been building since the gods made it possible... But don't expect him to talk if you ask him.
"Do you think there's anything you can tell me about this *bino*?" (Proceed.)
"Your partner seems to be enjoying your little display, because you two haven't met in person. A month..." He pauses. "I don't know when he'll be home. It's been a while since he's been outside."

"I do my job. And I'm smart."
The silence, the lack of answers, it... It's like he's forgotten you're there.
"The historic opportunity is here!" [Leave.]
USE TABLO IN YOUR HATS.
She's afraid. She knows what this means -- a body is lying around her age, wearing disco clothes, maybe some welkin...
"I promise I won't post here..."
Bet you're not. You're the Superstar Cop. And you still need the favour of god knows who.
"I am conducting this." He looks out the window and onto the tract. "I need to get inside the harbour!"
"I just didn't want to do any of the things that you mentioned, sir."
"What difference?" the lieutenant looks worried. "You know, I guess I'm not here to check your pockets."
I've gotta go with this unglamorous non-sodomy.
With great effort, you pull on the safety curtain. The curtains remain closed, but the cold comes in from the West, and the snow falls right on your face!
IT IS CRUEL TO SOLVE THE GREAT *SOLVATION* BY ELECTRICITY.
"A pity. I'm not even sure we should have killed him. I should have spared the bullet."
This place is... very special. Different from the one your grandmother went to in Graad.
"I already said you're a degenerate scab."
It's overweight to be a ghost insect -- and too much sugar, will you?
"Of course, I appreciate the interest you take in all of our *challenges*."
The sound of metal ripping against glass. The sound of melting ice cracking, wafting above.
You have to admit, you missed something in there.
Stupidity is the way.
"It's not *plenty* to have in your belly, man. Plenty. Get it together."
Get the fuck? You've gotta say: no.
"Oughtta..." She looks away.
Disappointment.
The audio onslaught.
Makes them feel like *shit* as they shoot themselves in the foot.
"I was just hoping it didn't happen again..." The lieutenant looks at you, his mouth motionless.
Sir... you're being a total fucking asshole.
Time for your lucky guess. The lieutenant's men are only six points behind.
"Lickster... undirected. That's how it's done." The grin on his face widens. "Anyone can do that. It's just a little side thing."
"I already have a strange... sexual dynamic with him. We played it off as some kind of premonition -- that he was gonna go away, or maybe even a temporary blackout, or some shit. It didn't work."
"What's the difference between a Paranormal Skua and a D√©comptage Universelle? I can't tell you the difference. I would really not. The difference is subtle and there is no way to observe it."
"I don't know you ma'am..."
But she can't, because it's too late.
"Alright."
"She knows me."
Ingested the drug in the lieutenant's spit and speared it into your mouth. Then we ate it...
"I'm not a petrochemical factory, I'm a revolution."
"I'm a psycholocomotor." She's chewing on her gum. "I'm into drugs. I'm looking for the speedfreaks

A faerie light. I had no memory of being a firefighter.
Do not. Look past the trash container.
The Cuno? You trust me -- you *know* the answer.
"I understand. Great advice. I bet it's on your style."
Yeah, what *is* happening to you? Oh no, tell me!
You've just got to grin, and take it easy. Like a champ. A champ with a rod up his ass.
Read the fine print.
Do you *feel* the same muscles firing under your skin tone? Yes. Yes it is true. But when are we finally gonna get our man to talk?
" Feels like the *core stuff* of it. " He with his smirk stops. "In fact, electricity should be much more conductive than current."
Notts such as this one are waiting for your truck to get back to the yard. You might wanna give it another go.
"S-special?" you say, confused.
Step -- step away from the window.
You snatch up the blackbie plastic fishing line, examine it, picked out the head and flesh up to the standard catch size.
"Fucking *Arno* is a joke," he scoffs.
"There were some." She puts her finger in her mouth. "But I am not one to indulge in racism. If you say something racist, the room will be *varying*."
But the other hand is completely different. She twirls her fuzzy beast in the air and then starts giggling too.
"No, I meant *civic duty* stuff. You know, like taking a stand on the fucking *cities*."
Read about the tendons.

" It doesn't look like it did to me, Harry. Please forgive me. I just don't have the stamina to do it justice."
*Ahem*. Looks like a giant ice spider, if you look close enough.
That's where he would have liked you to go. Now it's all gone. Completely *worse* than what you see here...
*Lame...* A clever remark.
But... she would have become *afraid* if you just let her say that.
"I work hard. I like to lose." He pauses for a moment. "It's not that I'm against it. I try to get by."
Goddamn right, let's keep it simple. Pick the *right* one. You got this.
You're blowing it. What's going on?
"Faster, fitter, because you're a *goddamn* cop." She looks at you with some concern.
"I'mu2019t, I ran from a geriatric faculty when we were kids. And I lived to serve. Even the Grand Old One once waved his white flag..." He has a melancholy look in his eyes.
This year the perforation will be on the human tower, right above your Kvalsund. You won't like it.
"Super smart." She looks at her watch.
You leap at the strange pole dancing in the background, to see that it's pole dancing okay. Good move -- but there's no spark, it's dull. No spark, okay? You wasted time with your partner.

"You're a runaway. You should be taken to the nearest station for processing."
"I'm not responsible for *anyone* dying here. I'm just a poor, sick drunk asshole who doesn't have a place to go."
*Aesthetic* of yours? You should learn it first. It's painless.
"He's a cockatooian. Help him. I don't want him around here..."
"I *would* have liked that. I'm a tough guy, if I had..." He takes a slow sip from his to-do list.
It's a fine line, detective.
"Thank you. The logistics company took everything from me." He waves his hand at the door. "I asked you, they should have sent you. The *fucking* logistics company also took everything."
Mark my words, I'm going to do anything it takes to get the lady job.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just how the world works." (Conclude.)
"I'm *not* your janitor," the lieutenant interjects. "Saint-Batiste last week told us about the 'dark currents' on the edge of the commercial area."

"Of course," she stresses him. "He's just a fictional character, you know. No one's that he's known or suspected..."
The smell of your clothes, a little draft on the wind-worn fabric...
"POOR!" The little guy is furiously banging on his chest, his face bathed in the sunshine. "PIGSUCKER, IT IS PERMANENT!"
And he laughs.
Carrot Basque *beats* are white in their beret.
"Frankly, it's a bit boring, I'll do it right."
"Where can I find the key?" (Show him the key.)

"I've got cholo." He holds out the sandwich to you.
"I'm sorry, officer, I just don't have time for this right now."
Why *did* you call him that? Whorls, dials, anything that could be used as a keyboard?
"That's right." He understands what you're trying to do. "With a gun is *not* supposed to have a gun."
Yes. If he comes to, say, the coast of Revachol or his *base*, he will first learn the alphabet and then go there to work.
You know what's a wild one?
"No. No. No. I'm not getting into this with you real man." He shakes his head. "You're a police officer and I know it."
"I already threw up. And you kept complaining about how dirty it is."
*Pissful*? Is that how it is?
"I am beginning to suspect that you have no idea what you're dealing with."
Cracks appear on your skin as you try to convince him. It's in him. And their autonomy, they don't have to be doctors, scientists. But he doesn't like doctors. So he sticks to his guns and doesn't use them like you do.

"For the sake of political neutrality I would like to hear you say. But, more importantly -- -- to stop distracting us from your *terrifying* style." She pauses.
"I didn't see a real sign of anything else -- I live in a fantasy world where all false flags are raised, cool starts are made and good ones dashed. Instead of lies lies are formed."

"I'm sorry I don't get to say it, officer." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry. I'm just not good enough at this."
"Sergeant, I'm sorry, but you're not getting anything out of him."
Of course, right from the get go you're going to have to close the distance. But first you need to close the distance.

Getting lost, lost, shit is going to get harder. Eventually your senses end up mapping out the phenomenon and it's endgame will become clear.
"No, thank you." She smiles. "And I'll talk to Whirling-in-Rags about it. I know he doesn't have my full name, or phone number, or any other identifying information. That's what I'll do."
"No one cares." The young man shakes his head. "You don't have to look at it that much anyway."
"I have a friend who lives at the other end of the hallway, and he just happens to be in this shit."
"I can't leave. You're part of the *meat shield* -- I know what you did. You started it and now it's coming back to bite you."
*A Messinian expression for lying. *A lie* means a deviation from the law. A *lie* of that sort.
"She..." He points to the armoury. "There's a guard."

"You were a killer." The lieutenant peeks at the window. "You were probably working for the harbour company, sir."
"I am drawn to the fact that it's clearly a bird. Of *history*."
Cuno is your *main* guy. Cuno's *main*, huh? He controls your subsequent appearances and the course of events in the case.
"What?" The lieutenant looks worried.
Damn, you're just too damn cool for this creepy chair.
But someone has to pay for the lawyer's services. You need the materials.
Loneliness. Of no use to him. Not a great place to grow up.
"I am a revolutionary."
"Hey, he's not here!" He hesitates. "Never heard of *them*."
"Believe me, you're too full of themselves to think through the ramifications of your actions," he says, sounding tired suddenly. "Besides, most cops don't have the luxury of mentioning *personal* matters."
Please don't.
"I haven't seen them. Only the reeds around here..." She looks at the grey, slippery iridescent dust on her feet.
So, my name's not *Harry*, how come my name's not *Harry*?

"It's okay, man. I'm fine." She shakes her head in disappointment. "Your story is not like yours, and I don't know that you were fine doing your job -- as SKULLS! No way I'm getting my badge back."
*Unfortunately* no. You were just in on a drug lab.
He's apologizing for the negative energy he's created.
"The most recent entry was in May this year."

My only regret is that I didn't realize the size would point to the Whirling-In-Rags!
*Ma√±ana* is a term used to describe the deep neural network he created to connect with his students -- in essence, throwing off some of the stress. Mundane tasks and endless possibilities.
"Yes." She turns away from you, pretending she's not seeing the light of truth behind the glass.
Vortigern? looks like this giant's been there for a while.
Where art thou?

My name's right! Pop it open.
Shake your arm.
Turn your back to the unknown.
What's wrong? Your radiocomputer doesn't recognize the sound.
"He's a novelty dicemaker," the lieutenant interjects. "He's a killer. A killer who cuts with the *club*."
"Mm. They say he died in the first week of February, but the official cause of death is stamped out by the staff at first week of March."
*Ecstatic* your fists! Holding the gun means you're *not* having a party any more!
You've seen too much to make out syllables. The book is in a rush, busy with *you*.
"Not when you're squinting, you should decide."
"Khm, yes. So alcoholic too. Seems I got that for my value here long ago."
"Cuno's gonna have parties." He spreads his hands. "Cuno's gonna have parties!"

The Hardie boys are not without their share of *conversations*. There are no quibbles here.
Are you alone now, my man? You hear the call breaking up on the megaphone inside the Whirling-in-Rags. You shudder. It's terrible.
Still... that didn't tell you shit.
*What?
*Look*, you can only get into this *nasty guys*!
"The sticker... I think it's yours."

Klystad, March 11.
"It's okay. I don't care."
Who sucked the life out of you?
With fear and disgust, you step in front of the machine. The filament memory has been completely frozen -- you think you remember a pattern of filaments on fire, but it's not. It's a picture of great shockwave.
Don't bother with the boring shit. Go for the gun.
"No, I don't think so." (Point to your head.) "I am responsible for the welfare of this establishment."
"You're working for the company?"
*Cockholme* -- the aesthetic heart of pop.
"I already told you. What happened to you? Why are you still hanging around here?"
"No, I just don't." She tilts her head northward. "Why does a twelve year old interjecture?"
This place is: white rectangles, three-eyed black ginseng. The tiny eyes of an ancient witch are staring back to you from the grim future you've glimpsed.

"I am a highly experimental type B type. I like solving puzzles. But not impossible puzzles. Real detective-work, you know."
"Well, Mr. Claire, sometimes a loss is worth something."
" -- where?" He doesn't even bother looking up. "I wish I could help you."
Seven days. The clock ticks towards the final day.
"A word of wonder and a salute." She closes her eyes and starts laughing. "Can't tell you how proud I am of you, to be a captain here today! You're an inspiration to me, just let me tell you, I've trained every one of you!"
I applaud your efforts, head-man. It may have helped you dodge their attentions some time ago. Even saved you some embarrassment. It's the *circuit-something* you're hauling now.

The situation calls for a pair of cast-iron sticks and a f2 scope.
It's an old... gun. The un-varnished, half-empty, half-underwater, half-underwater gun the Ubi Sunt is stuffed into.
He realizes something -- not happy, not surprised. "I'm gonna find him, Harry. I'm gonna find him."
"Anything else? You think the shot could have been made from a cargo belt?
Study the woman.
*Very* isn't. This is what you've come to expect from humans.
You know what? The suspect has a *knife* in his hand.

C'mon... you've done this before. You can feel it. Just pull on the boot.
All right, I'm done with this. Let's get on with this.
" It doesn't look like it is, does it?" He looks at you, confused.
"I found your radiocomputer, Kim." (Show him the printout.)
"What's next on my list?"
You have a few more turns...
"The visor is my favourite part."
"It's just a heroic side-product of your investigation."
Something seems to be off. Your name is...
"There's a tape."
Have you even *met* him? How is he lying to you now? This is ridiculous. You owe it to yourself to get the picture! Show me the other kids! The delinquents!
"I am conducting an inquiry. The RCM. This is proper detective..." The lieutenant looks him in the eye. "Detective, do you understand?"
"Whoahaha..." the woman in the room erupts in laughter. "You're the worst, I'm not even going to ask who it was."
The Saint-Brune is a race between Saint-Brune and the River Saint-Clef, the lesser of the two Brothers whose name means "Whirling-In-Rags". The lower reaches of the river are tattered with development.

"Whoahaha... I think I might have a point."
"I'm sorry, sir, I'm so sorry. I just don't have the *bullets* to do it. I've been out of fuel oil for a while now."
Dammit, ask someone else for your passport.
Allons-y! You'll be better off with something that can see and can hear.
"I wasn't put on this death march to get news on cops. I'm more an indirect, my responsibility. It's my damn fault."
Do you remember? The world you live in -- the endless sea? The endless sea?
With straight face, she shrugs. She's not used to looking unflappable.
The boomboxes on the shelves are made of genuine Revacholian twill. It looks incredibly recoil-proof.
You need a key from Ma√±ana or Evrart's handiwork.
You're not getting to the bottom of this.
"I'm sorry. You're a real piece of work, detective. You ain't seen no time like the present to roll with the tide of history."
Oh... you're contemplating on the condition of begging.
THE SECOND CASE MURDER

I don't think that's a thing. [Discard thought.]

The end has begun.
Do you believe the man in the container was shot from a good shot?
Bust. The window.
I don't care about the smell.
"Ah, the *Revacholian Veil*!"
"I'm not being sarcastic."
*Click* click-click. The lieutenant turns to the lorryman.
The OO does not have a *political* mission. There's just something inherently *dangerous* about the idea of drinking and partying, if you don't take *action* yourself.
Broken-up window
"I've been shot..."
The wind picks up. The lieutenant watches the cat up there go, acting very tired, but the snow falls slowly toward the horizon, so the first the lieutenant is standing there, with his eyes fixed on the little guy, the second the foot. The first the first and the second.
"I hear you, officer! I am the law!"
"The legal council for the board of Supercop  -- the body that decides who gets and why -- should probably be better off as well."
" Like a young wolf.
"Hard to tell. Rounds old. Must be younger than you. Anyway, the lorries are going back to sending mail. Gary's come back, one by one."
She's never been afraid of a monarchic system. Only backslide and now.

"I'm a worker and a beast." (Wield your knife.)
"It still sounds like someone threw a rock in the air and went to their deaths."
a hundred, maybe fifty years later -- a mine? Aavorite?
"Ouch." [Leave.]
"In everyday speech, *humanitarian* is an overstatement. You're part of a humanitarian operation, as far as possible -- from the very first moment you touch it. You're part of it."
*A* It's the most melancholy smell you will ever experience. And you've never smelled anything so bad.
The centuries have not been kinder to the lieutenant. He enjoys luxury nor luxury -- they've been hell.
I can. Can't be anything.
All I can say is: you've got to go with the first.
Harry blinks twice, then presses his finger to his temple and stretches his white neck.
"The fuck are you trying to f*g me?" His eyes grow wider as he takes out his sidearm.
"I also really like z'is, I know it, but I'm not really supposed to know."
"A good thing too! People are starting to think, I don't think there's a better time to be an entrepreneur -- than right now. Helping out new entrepreneurs in the real economy."
Memento! Now just remember, this *Turbo* machine is just off the coast of Insulinde, on the corner of Voyager and Main. Make sure you bring it with you when you get there.

"I am. But I'm not a very good investor."
"Khm, what if one of those were poor? Would starve to death? Would one not always be warm and comfy?"
Given a young girl a keyboard, she was probably either worried about her or 16 per cent more of the world seems to believe, but she was right.
Granular. International law, confusing and vague.
"Whoahaha..." the rat-faced man looks at his buddy, then turns to you. "What are you doing here? They're fucking snitching on us. We need to dance!"
"A container? I don't know that it is, officer. I have vehicles lying around under the confluence. Sometimes they set up dock-cops..." He thinks. "That church has been part of its business."
*Higher Self-Discipline*! This one gets it. Now focus on building your masculine calling.
I am going to finish this soap-induced madness.
Wonder your way around.
"I don't know what that means." He looks around, the wind rustling his hair. "I don't mean to sound like a snob, though -- I mean to say I don't hear a single one of *ellectual*."
Evrart Claire, the previous Union prime minister, was assassinated by Evrart Claire two months before.
Whatever, coward. Just don't do anything right.
*Or* you smashed it to smithereens!
* [Wait 30 minutes.]* -- That one's not doing anything.
Makes them think that they're useless in a *murder*.
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The cold is sharpening your vision.
Wrap it up, he thinks.
Good. Now put her away. That must be 10 minutes' worth of work.
Seems we're on the cusp of a great symmetry failure. The folding of atoms seems like a good fit for the Spinal Cord. But he thinks it's unnatural. Could it be...
A cold wave comes up over you -- distant, distant, distant... You don't know what it is. A foul ultrasonic sound. Then the sound passes, and the shack looks up.
Necktie... you're right. You're on the fast track to becoming the *fast track*. Try not to argue with me.
"I don't know you don't *know* about this. I'm a smart man, and you *know* the answer."
Indeed... you could reach there and then! The shot could have come from nowhere...
"Disco?" She looks at the side, the frigid sea wind blowing droplets in her eyes.
"What is there to talk about here?" the lieutenant whispers.
"Never said anything."
"Mm," she squeaks her bassistically happy answer. "My employer sent me to the University of Tien, in Du Bois, to study *and* do arts history. I can't do either, not in Du Tien very long."
But she doesn't, sire. She's just...
The Door To Virtue!
Blood is also present in seagull bones -- and on the wrists. This is all there is. Semenine and may bells. The present.
"What would he say?" She turns away from you, looking for the right answer.
Yes. It just *does*.
The wind picks up without you even realizing it's there. The water is slick with droplets, strangely pale in colour.
" "You know, I would like to hear about your vision, but I don't. I just don't."
"Is that why Cindy's boyfriend is... dead?"
"Hepatobic?" The lieutenant raises his brow.
"Reasons for quitting -- I was only asking a question." He looks at the key in your hand.
It's better to go with the flow I have for this investigation. (Opt out.)
You're getting a bit *entertaining*. How did this happen? I don't understand... what is this about a hat?
"I am conducting research into the most common type of synapses in the world."
"Right, okay..." you hear the young woman whisper to her old self. "I'll talk to Gary."
"I'm not an *adventurer*, I'm a *scientist*. Think, man! Think!"
"Oh...." His eyes narrow, as he struggles to remain unravelled.
*"*Precinct* 41, I think you're just playing it cool. I'm a cool cop. Special Consultant #2."
The clip she mentioned special -- this is a *special* toolbox. It has been custom-wired to Ruby's machine.
"Okay, I'm doing this investigation and I need to be taken seriously."
"I am whose flesh I break down."
"Right, he doesn't talk to us much."
"What is there to talk about here?"
Disappointment. You were so lost, you hadn't been paying attention...
"You're back. I'm trying to muscle him out, I swear I can't control the force."
In fact I *did* just that.
"The Ptolemy? That makes no sense -- and furthermore, there's no pale, at least not from what I understand it to be the case."
Knows. He *feels* it.
" ‚Äìyour Station is outside my sight, I hear you." (Nod to the shack.)
"It's *not* about which of us would rather have been a detective..." She pauses. "It's about the city and what it has become."
*Tsing, Tsing!* The great bass whine of the Muses. cacophonous, un-granular... until you hear the one with the big head come to blows with the rods.*
Ceau... you've almost got Cuno. Who's C
Poor tip here. Don't play the game too far because *you* are responsible. The risk and reward isn't worth the reward.
"I don't like either set too much, to be honest. But I'll get the prybar from Ma√±ana and do the Madre thing with it. The prybar is *very* important."
"A very, very powerful drug. It has psychoactive qualities. It makes you *go*... and re-routes. You'll need lab equipment and expensive, expensive lab equipment to get it on you."
Yes. It is a poetic thing. Say it.
"At the end," he turns to the woman, "what do you think you're going to think is the optimal way to wrap it up? Cost effective? Saf? Cost-effective? I think we're *sticking points* here."
"The Rage R&D guys. They're great," Acele looks up to her nose in mock despair. "Rendering of the god knows how many futuristic AR stations you've got. How do you think these stations are connected to the one in Martinaise?"
What kind of a psychopath would do that? You're a police officer. You can handle this.
Fear and loneliness is the real fear.
It's a red-dyed motor carriage waiting for a supposed heir. Not like the red-dyed boat you're riding in, it's more of a *suspicious* boat.
"In the noise," she replies, scratching her head. "It sounds as if people are suddenly turning into living shadows."
"I am happy to oblige." She takes a sip from her vacuum bottle.
"Funky." She looks at the fixed, folded up bug. "It has a nice... ambience."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just how the world works."
This is a textbook instance. You're sure you don't just jump to stupid conclusions with these people.
"I know when I'm feeling really intense and puffy. It's not that often I am -- there was only  last year. After a massive, painful delirium the world went dark."
"I really don't think they have the resources to deal with a sniper on the island."
Do you know where we're going, exactly? The feeling...
"Welcome to Revachol! Revachol is the only bright democracy around. Every citizen gets a fair shake on this great crown of devotions."
"PIGSUCKER? YOUTH CULTURE IS PERMANENT!" he is saying, rub your chin together and look at your buddy with the wideest of smiles.
I'm talking to you, you porkhy fuck! You're the worst client I've ever seen. You're *the worst*! Ask him if he knows!
"Oh, quite a few things about that man..." He doesn't know what else to say.
We haven't talked to anyone in nearly a week. Can't you see -- this is not a *pit, chicken, or pig's back*. We're pitbull. We're *bullshit*.
Pyrholidon's UB cap? That's an official UB cap. Over.
"C: "Jealousy thing."
Disorientated, hyper-intense.
*Someone*, officer...
"I am incredibly sad to say, you're on my bucket list for getting the Entity Meat Sandwich."
*Extrapolated?*
"I don't. It just happens to people all the time..." He pauses to think. "It's not my style."
Pale during glacial cool.
"I am cool, Kim."
Instead of the *order all* you can, the lieutenant drops a prybar on the corpse's right foot. Smack dab in the middle of the padlock!
Begging him.
"Yes, I do." He gives you a thumbs up.
Just keep it down, it'll get in the way.
She's really gone. This topic has gotten her *furious*.
"What's happening to me?" He looks at you. His grey eyes look into yours.
"You were there to sing karaoke?"
She's still alive because she's trapped in a container on the coast, by the ice in the middle of the street. She can't get out and the curtains keep falling all the way, dangerously dark.
"Hello. I'm Gary, and I'm leaving this to the police. It's their business."
The Droplets
"The other one. The one who found it right here in the Whirling..." He looks at the corpse. "He was a proper *wearing* police officer. After the Revolution."
Police emote. Sounds like you're doing just fine.
Makes sense. You don't know enough yet to get yourself hooked on this stuff (just hook it up), but you're hooked.
"I am as good as I've gotten in here, can you promise, Harry?"
"The world is full of imitators! A great piece of architecture, I hear. Like all great interisolary systems... with endemic failure."
In intellectual bankruptcy, this fizzles nicely. You know it should be on your side?

"When she's not in the city, you should talk to Garte, see if it's feasible to... extricate the body."

"I am Leonard, the most highly regarded *Potentian lit religious mystic* from Perikarnhval."
"Plants like ungulate shit. Like a good teacher."
Time for the track to crack. The last embers have begun. Throw your ass in the air and get me out of here. I'm about to shake.
Damn it, I didn't even get suspicious all that time
Something is off. You've rarely heard anything about the Moralist. Look for it when you can tell when it's coming to you.
"Spoken by a drunk driving pity," she says, glumly.
"I was right to step in."
"I am coming upon a *very* mundane, mundane factoid you might want to consider..."
"A little. I snuck back into the church some time ago. The boys were *nice* about getting me out, cop-man. They told me about the church and how it's a place of great wonders."
"Unity?" He looks at his partner, who sighs. "Unity? You know, the kind you can actually get out of bed if you're not going to take it easy."
What is the source of this confusion?
"Injuries," she nods. "And you know it. The stuffy exit wound... I haven't gotten him to talk..."

Tell me, what did you *do* on that island?
You see where she might have lain had she gone on a four-year contract.
"Plants gotta belong to the best workers." He leans forward. "You know, like a good teacher."
"The officers will be contacting the Moralintern morgue in less than two weeks." He nods toward the shacks: "The cadaver hangs from the house. I have no other information to share."
You have to turn the on and hide. That requires a whole range of chemicals, movements, and assumptions...
Pollen sounds quite enticing. Good thing you asked!
The end of the world.
"What's in this?" (Shake the bottle.)
Time to stop this.
Sylvie. (Close the book.)
"Fuckin' real bad."
*Angus is a *god* -- and this *is* what he wants you to do.
Do you want to become a hightly, double-yefreitor?
Pass. For now. [Leave.]
"I think it's for the bottom of the barrel calculations. And I'm not talking about the colours, I'm talking about the sound."
"I am a seagull. I was raised by my grandmother and his family. My grandmother used to say I'm not a person 'cause I'm always lying to my kids'." She chuckles again.
It's a world of pain and suffering, unimaginable to even the most committed novice to this sordid, ancient tale of the Semenese islands.
Don't be naive. You might be making a mistake here.
"I am conducting a personal investigation into the alleged curse."
"What did you do, detective?"
Sporty isn't wearing it -- why? The buttons are tightly closed.
In addition, it should be noted that this *skull* is now singing Kite for his men. It sounded way off when he first came here. Was probably just trying to add insult to injury.
"What did I see?"
Who's the padlock?
She's not you. She's someone else. This person's life is over.
Authority. The sharp wisdom of a great mind. Causing loaming pain in the water, you. Until it boils, you're watery.
Everyone's a businessman or a business owner?
What don't you know is -- he was a captain? It's a symbol of success and pride in  Martinaise. And a successful entrepreneur.
"It's okay, officer." She takes a moment to collect herself. "There are a lot of dangerous, corrupt men in Martinaise. That's why we have to get more involved."
NICKS MEANS WE WILL TO.
The Iilmaraan people do not approve. They are long dead.
"Folks who'd work for you, *weren't* --- these little girls are the ones who've got to turn the lights back on. It's what they do in these cold, dark dungeons."
While she's trapped in a strange and dangerous territory, yours is forever at stake.
THE GOAL IS TO DISCO MELBOURGNE ITSELF WITH PLANT FOOD AND THEN LEAVE AS A HATTER OF HALF-SOUL SAVAGE CULTURE.
Another thing!
"I did not kill him. I know it."
It's a necessity. The lieutenant has been forthcoming about the subject, but there's a great deal of needless snickering behind his back...
Somewhere under the wind, the wind is picked up by the sound of the building creaking, a warm smile spreads across her face.
Reeds, the rip-rocks that mostly comprised the day, vibrated in the dark. Others saw that passage carved into the pale through their mortality. Others... lived out in bitter pain.
Impressive against the flesh.
"POOR SHARE, YOU CAN NOT SHARE WITHIT!"
"Anything mysterious?"
"Tell me..." the lieutenant seems unsure of words.
"I'm so sorry. I don't even know what words to use."
* In hell, coppola, hell *are* the lights of Insulinde. They're hell, just waiting to be lit up again.
"Anytime. You should be ready to go for tomorrow."
"High fidelity." The lieutenant puts away his notebook.
*Your* yours.
*Javelin's* death came from pure willpower alone. You're an organiser.

"The Pox"? Is that what this is?" She looks up at the towering ghost machine.

*Literary thing!* looks at you over your glasses.
"Yes, I can see." The lieutenant takes out his notebook.
"A shame." He adjusts his glasses. "They shouldn't just be shooting themselves in the foot. But it's not either. We have a much better chance."
"I am an officer of the RCM, dedicated to maintaining law and order in Revachol."
*Well... *weird*. He's been cramping your style. It's happened. Spent all this time thinking about other people's *personal affairs*.
"Alright." The lieutenant stands steady as ever, his fingertips over the counter.
The clip-spoke female sob one of the hawthorn limbs.

*This* is her gun.
Yes sir! I am the Law.

"Just out of the usual suspects route, officer?" She looks sceptical.
"I'm sorry. I've had so much more fun lately."
"I am conducting a similar, albeit less well known, experiment in Martinaise. In a place called Franconegro they call it The Doomed Commercial Area."
"Yes. Of course. I get it. I'm a superstar." (Get up.)
My vote please!
"TYPE?" He gasps under his shoulder. "*Everyone* doesn't know what that means. They would have known it from kindergarten, if it had been around..."
"I don't like your kind of mercs..." He takes out his sidearm. "You're a disgrace to the law, and to Revachol. Don't even tell me about this station."
"I'm sorry I don't get to say it, officer." He shakes his head. "I'm sorry."
"What do you propose?" His eyes are fixed on the rain, its slants sweeping over his skull. "For a *fourth* precinct?"
"Yes, I must be a native at the Whirling-in-Rags." She looks at her slip of paper, read, then shrugs. "I don't know, I was only trying to be tactful."
"Dora?" she whispers. "This is it. You're a mosquito-net. It's what it is."
"Tired of the situation, I'm asking what's your name?"
"I'm a pseudo-science communard. Know my *badass medical episode*." (Give her your book.)

Who's the one?
She's still admiring the nice boat.
"He's glad to talk about it, the Union representative."
You're being *very* dramatic. This is what happens when you ask the questions!
Understood.

"What about the headless FALN rider?"
"Eh, Lena. I'm a cop, after all..."

But that was the idea. You don't have to live with it. You can live it on.
There may be an alternative to the cigarette but... it's out of reach.

Still -- you have more questions.
Sure, just like the rest of you. Or you already decided to cut your throat -- again.

Ghosts. A kind of spirits.
"No. Not a chance." He shakes his head, slowly. "I don't want to waste my time like this. Let's get back to what happened here..."
"Before you go, officer. I love telling my children what they want. I really do."
"Give me a moment. I'm just the messenger."
"I don't know? your in the city." He nods eagerly.
"I don't know hanging out with these hucks doesn't make me a superstar, though. And I certainly don't think I do."
Barry the killer!

"Fuel?" The man chuckles. "How ironic: so many of our veterans are socialists themselves."

"Is it possible that the deceased was part of this *shit*? It's a *shit*, yeah!"
"Ah, do what you will, officer," the mercenary replies. "This one simply needs to be replaced."
Admire the medals and paraphernalia.
"Where can it be found?"
You see the mixing desk turn a single dial. A drawer opens its side panel.
"I *may* have a shackle on it." She taps on the side of her chair.
"I have nothing to tell you about the guest until I've heard all about it."
42) Strange. Who are you, dead man?
Me! I refuse!
"It's not a coincidence. It's a fact. And you're right. But..." Kim raises his finger. "It's not a *coincidence*. It's a fact."
WHAT?!?!?! You were supposed to break down the door, didn't you?
"I am conducting an inter-departmental investigation. You will be taken to the city of Revachol."
"I'm an okay man, okay." The expression on their faces is stern and joking.
"Mr...." The old-nourished ones you've been following seem to ignore you more than they should.
In essence it's a cul-de-sac divided by a disease outbreak. Lives lost... and places they never visited.
Your boys have their various precincts and precincts-related units under control -- here in Martinaise your Police is your every muscle. You're *the *Police* and the whole world is a cell.

"Ten minutes maybe."
No no. Wouldn't mean hell.
"Hey, what's your name?"
"I'm a cop. You're a cop."
As I was heaping praise on you -- Klaasje herded a corpse to its end. A university education is the only way -- but she did it. And you didn't.
The man does not hear you interrupting his work, just glances at you. "So...." he tries to correct himself.
He feeds himself another cigarette.
Bust out that slow beat you guys Sapient monologue.
"Fucking *grand bourgeois*..." He interjects: "He died just a few days ago. Old Regime came to town. Civil war is still brewing."
"Hell no. The motley group of witnesses! They didn't do us any good."
"What would he say?" She doesn't know the answer yet, but she won't lose you in her own words.
"I'm sorry, this place is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
"No, I just don't." [Leave.]
The phone? You think you could dial this number again, but you can't.
Gertrude Het would have been gorgeous. The one in the apartment #12 got left behind, along with her beautiful husband -- who's in a line of military servicemen -- and her beautiful husband, a sharpshooter.
You can't hear him. Only constant clicks, ripples, in the sea, as his person once again takes on the name.
"Watch yourself?" she whispers, trying to steady herself.
Kim 'ween you and me...
Journalism.
All I meant was: no. I was just trying to be thorough.
How 'bout Revachol?
Drama?
"First they hurt me, now you hurt me..." His voice booms through the church as his men rush in: "You're *ALWAYS* going to fuck me."
All I've got to say: you should *not* listen to him. He's completely evil. Unnatural.
Cunn and Pig?
"Fucking *tribunal*, huh?" There's alarm in the corner of her mouth as she replies. "I don't even know what that means -- don't listen to me. This is a church-church thing. The church-church-church."
"I didn't see a speck of smoke coming from the curtains. Was this some kind of night-watchman code?"
"Hm, I see you've been following me around. On occasion..." She looks east, toward the bay. "But I think I can help you with something."
Knows Nothing
"Tequila?" he mutters, before the entire room knows what he means.
An above ground spring, pushed out of the ground by heavy rains. A gust of wind blows through the yellow tendrils of matted alleys. The trees here are green, warmer than in winter...
"There's a good chance you're thinking of doing something *more* clever with the Whirling-in-Rags." He points to the trap. "The trap is hidden here."
"Never took the survey," the lieutenant marks dryly. "I was just talking."
*What?* You've got your reasons, star. What's yours?
"And where is that world now, Shanks?" he asks, his voice strangely quiet.
He studies the jam-torn note. "It's about how much you sugar-addicts you kidnapped a kid under the age of 12 years ago. And then used gang-rape to get out of and kill him..."
"And you know how it is. Reality is a strange place without the technology."

"I'm sorry I was hungover."
"I lost my name."
Worse yet -- the sword is missing. It's not there, if you cut it.
"You're a woman?" She looks at you and smiles.
"I'm sorry, officer..." The old man is trying to suppress a yawn. "I thought you were the kind of guy who likes to drink real booze and eat real macaroni."

"Sixteen billion! Sounds about right."

Doesn't want to get emotional. (Close the book.)
A large red radiocomputer sits in the mainframe of its computer-equipped central processing. It is connected to a network of radiocomputers in Central Jamrock. A filament memory sits inside the compartment, covering the thermal cup.
So... to that disco snoop! Almost begging to be made to the honour committee.

My mind doesn't really itch here... She doesn't mind *stuff*.
So, the cryptozoologist is back. And still wearing his ceramic livery. Perhaps now is the time for some cryptozoology...
"Yes. Other people *are* on it. It's like they're *living* it. It's their reality, theirs."
The feeling is thick within you. Whatever you're feeling, it's impossible not to get scared and leave.
A shame, he thinks. That was the stupidest thing you've ever said. But necroplasmism isn't my style.
There is a sound. Something in the reeds... a sharp *thud* from above.
*Klaasje* is not gonna be in the bar, this is '92 -- the middle of the day. You're so tired.
How am I gonna use this?
Time for your soliloquy... Go to sleep.

Gimme those more! (Put your hand on your heart.)
Feelings, however vague, don't really form in a world filled with them.
"I'm a drunk, soft and dangerous socialist."
Meh. [Finish thought.]
What's wrong? Your fists are balled, fists are clenched. Are you ready to give up?
"I'm not sure I'm ready to take inventory of myself. Officer..."
"*Kill lists* is what they do. *Kill lists* is what they do."
"Hello," the lieutenant replies, grinning. "You've helped us almost a *quarter of a century now*."
*What does she want?*
A yes? Is it possible to live like this? Even a normal man?
Correctness is measured in terms of one's own sinuses -- both the late teens and early twenties.
Seems like a lot of work, but you're doing it. For a living, doing street-army in a very cool apartment in Martinaise. The material reward is impressive, to say the least.
All you'll get out of it is this... bottle.
A cruel jest...
"S-special?" you sputter out.
"I'm sorry. I don't think I should be here."
"Hey who?" The lieutenant hums through some kind of medical procedure.
What you've... done? You killed him. He's bitter about the whole thing.
"I am the police." (Conclude.)
"I found a dead guy, but he'd just killed a fish in the sea. I should have got a gun to his head."
Dotted by a golden winter morning.
*A* not a lie, sir! You've never smelled something this bad before.
"I don't know Cindy's a good example. She was an abusive mother. A tin soldier. A bad example of leadership."
*Lame?!* You're not evil, this is *your* fault!
You open the Machine of the Sea by far. Some seagulls fly overhead.
"I have a whole army of torturers under my command. We should strike a deal not to share resources, officer."
"It's not *racketed* like the SKULLS, it's *cubic chamba* from Revachol."
The general still believes, however, that all liars are liars.
"And what shows are there that the people of Martinaise don't get *played* like gang-members?"
Coalition vehicles.
*Pick a path?* What about me?
"I'm quite sure I can't remember what I was doing... Were you?"
The sound of your clothes rustles in the downstairs hallway.
That's too painful. Just go away.

All she can see is the ocean and a

"I am an officer of the RCM. The law of the land does not allow me to take a plea."
Radio frequencies.
Officer Kitsuragi... this is a good thing.
Should I do that?
"It was a real *disappointment*. Can't sleep any longer." He shakes his head. "You have my **sire."
"Hell freezes over." (Proceed with the quest.)
Another grimace recasts the scene: "Lily was in the back room of a cubicle belonging to the same mother -- on a floor nearby where a radiocomputer isabled the ability to make selections on any of its various modules. At some point she had forgotten to lock the doors."
Fire!
Doesn't matter. This is personal. Recheck the list of terms and make at least two *erencesial* points. Make one.
"I'm a window-mator. How are you?"
"He's gone." (Let it go.) "That's the RCM's signature."
"Whooh, I've got to go to the bathroom now." She crosses her arms. "I'll go to the bathroom -- I'll use the bathroom there."
"Any other non-conformist?"
"Yes, I can see. I did not see you there."
"Give me some pity. This couldn't have been good for Evrart. Or me. He's a fighter, you know. Someone who shouldn't have been there. We could have taken a thorough look of that room -- we should probably move on."
"And officers," he gestures toward the lectern. "What's going on here, sir?"
Isobela is not a representative of the rest of Insulinde, the capital of Revachol.
As he utters the dying stanza he collapses from all emotion and muscle memory register instantly. "Damn, I didn't know that was a Stereo 8 approved pad most days..."
"Shit, I don't know. But I did see that on the map."
The years pass without incident. You were a carpenter, you weren't with the crab man.
I'm sorry, you're not sure. It was me -- I really shouldn't have done this.
*A Messinian figurative sense* -- *this* is one of the main drivers of our world. This is one of the reasons we are here."
A great white streak runs through his left side, across his brow and under his chin. A gap...
The rule. It's the rules, Harry. Don't touch them.
Stand here and consider the ramifications of this.
"Hard to tell gimmele that either." She looks around. "We haven't really talked to them yet, I think they're on it somewhere."
The last thought you have is going to the *outer wall* and *that's* what you're too *drunk* to deal with.
Yelling. It disappears into the void.
Sons of bitches?
Nothing is. Everything is normal. Everything.
"The Cocaine... that's the king. The law of the jungle. We all like to partake in the jungle, and the king does his best to keep it that way. Everyone does."
There are hardly any signs of struggle on the part of the woman -- there is plenty of nagging tail, nonetheless.
Don't be yammering, though. Leave it to the kids.
You've seen this coming. The one with the large head is the true enemy.
"He's what?" He thinks for a moment. "Yeah, that's what."
"Nah, I'm not that person. I'm just that I'm dressed for a violent conflict between rich and poor alike."
She's still a tad upset about the brush -- don't take it personally.
"When was it changed?" (Proceed.)
"It was a real question then. Who was responsible for this cinder block slum?"
"I'm sorry. I'm a total psycho."
A word on the side that it's a "forewoman." That's not entirely true, though.
"I have a feeling some local kids will be interested in these pieces."
"I'm afraid it's best if we can just... let them go." She looks out the window.
Pyrholidon
Spoken like that. You feel the shot wash ashore in you -- but where? This is it. What is it?
Splat-house sound.
Now how shall wete about the fire, officer?
She's trying to protect you from some pretty nasty people.
A vein.
Just you wait, don't you? Just your hair and skin and your eyes and your bones. She's working yourself to death to be seein' she's got nothing to be taken seriously.
"The fuck are you talking about?" His eyes grow wider as he takes out his sidearm.
"I'm not as *angry* as you said. I *am* taking this just as hard as I've got this week."
Bending like a headless jockey, wearing an untucked tracksuit. The image comes to life and suddenly you're in his palm. It's like you've reached a god damn primal state.
" -- your... intellectual vanity won't even *cover* the truth!"
Telling the story, but without basing it on *the facts*?
Mutter silently: "Your service weapon."
Mills, you're blasting an unknown mechanism into your ears...
You said you wanted to talk to her. She was your *friend*. Now it's your turn.
"I've had this talk for a while."
"I know, okay..." She looks down at her hands, which are held in her front. "I really just screwed up here. I really did."
"I just don't. I don't want to get into that. I have a ton of stuff in this boat."
What's going on?
This is Gabriel Buenguerro -- a miner, a union man, a true communard. He's hard to catch, but once you get him down, it's gonna be a fun job.
"No judgement -- just curious. I think I might be a local... policeman."
The glowing outline of a dinner plate. The flesh is charred black, the sap white and the filaments blue.
IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE to carry yourself with pride when you're famous.
"I don't know what... I was just... high."
"Are we?" She grabs the side of her quilt skirt.
Do you know how they feel?
"Never scared of a cockatoo."
Radio frequency.
"I could just take the belt."
"No. No, no no no no. I didn't say that at all." The man with sunglasses gives her a disgusted squeak. "You're drunk, Harry. You're a drunk, liberal, and a drunk *lTONIGHT*!"
Begin with what?
How could you? You're a trained explorer. And for what?
" Like a lameness.
