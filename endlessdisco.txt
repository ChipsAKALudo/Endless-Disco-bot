"What would he say?" She doesn't know the answer yet, she won't lose herself in her own words.
Hold yourself together. [Wait 0.5 seconds.]
"What has he been drinking?"
"I wanted to see if the old man was in there." She points to the red door.
"I'd rather spend my time with folks who actually care about *the thing* then work on something *that's* not possible. I'm not a cop, *and* I wouldn't do anything like that..." He glances around.
"Yeah, I mean... I like cars, you know."
"What about some tare straws?"
"You did that." The lieutenant looks at you and makes small talk. "This guy's got *issues* -- and you got it all under control."
"He's right." He turns to you. "You might think that a man your height wielding a firearm is a rare occurrence, but you'd be wrong. There have been a lot of them. A lot of incidents like this."
The owner of this mausoleum wishes you bad things about him for once.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. Though you're not *from* Messina you look more or less the same, though with a slight *crease*.
The usual being "have you seen anything out of the ordinary" or "has anyone in the neighbourhood?"
Hard to say. Maybe the hobo runner is still *behind* the fence? Who knows what he might be doing there.
I'm barely holding it together. There's no way this thing is gonna get *any* worse than it is now.
"Yeah, sure. You're right." She looks around. "What's next?"
No, I was *cool*. I was in my sweet sleep. I woke up just like you did. Like you did, without even a cloud of drugs in me. Like you did, without even a trace of *mimicking* the bassline. It was the night of March 4th and the world waited.
"Ah yes. My daughter, Miss T. Tunney, here. She was a real treat for us. But I know my children will be *unpleasantly* surprised if their mother is not here when they get home. Just now I saw you clean out the trash. Good work."
He nods to you and says...
An ordinary chalk-stroke is all it takes to make a person talk. Don't make people talk, Harry. You should concentrate on the *crime* instead.
An egg-clutching monster comes alive, its gelatinous belly feeding on the life essence of a terminal cancer. Its tentacles give it purpose and hope. You are the *man with the microphone*.
"An acquaintance of mine who works in logistics -- she seemed tired. She should be back in the mess hall by tonight."
The words *shit* and *lividity*.
The crust is hard and cold, hard rock and hard ice. An old carabineer holds court in the middle of a frozen lake. The hillsides around it are losing their lustre, but Song crumbles, as if it was always meant to stay.
You hear echoes of splashing around in the waves and the sounds of the city. Beyond that, a pull of wind...
"You're right. I should have seen it."
"All thanks to you, officer." The lieutenant nods, turning to you. "Had you not shagged yourself so much, I doubt it."
The water lock on the
A wicked grin cleaves to your lips as you realize what you said. "What could *ever*... *ever*..."
"Some dude, lost it in the Whirling-In-Rags... and ran away. That's all I know. And the police said he left it behind at the College of Virtual Worlds."
You have the full, *complete* history of Suzerainty, so stop stalling. Show them what you can do.
"No, I haven't. I was just testing you."
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, recall the STYLE of HONOUR. A pure *honour* player.
The strong winds of Martinaise continue. In the distance, on the Martinaise Historic District, a great boom! A new era begins
But he *knows* about the duel?
What's the difference between a stinking, pathetic human and an irrepressible rebel?
"This is pathetic and unprofessional of you. Stop wasting your time." She sounds annoyed now, but the bad feeling lingers. "Let's go."
Yes, but what's the role of a percussion loop in a live performance?
"Fuck no, I'm done with this shell-shocked shit-shmunching shit. Can't get what comes out of my ass."
Outside the window -- the night is overcast, there's movement in the sand, and the sand all the time. Some birds hover above the beach. Flashes
No, it's the Chitinous Islands at the Equator. Don't make it about *you*. This is the wrong move. Wait, track it down!
That bad ass house on the hill.
He's bluffing. Clarity is impossible. You need to lie to him again. Go ahead, it's in your hands -- hiss, hiss, it's all in there, son. In there.
Are you actually satisfied with your physical form? You don't know what to say. Perhaps you *are* satisfied?
Already gave the thumb's down.
It feels like you're peeking into someone's home residence. Inside it's private, cozy, warm. Dusty, too, and smelling of body odour.
Take the speed.
Is it for the best if I don't go?
On the small island off the coast of Martinaise there is a man in his early thirties. Short, dark and lean -- a solid seven-set
What does he see in you?
"But we're in a hurry."
Her chin rub against the keyboard, humming a duet, as she stares at the notes.
"Yes, well..." She looks to the sea. "I guess I'm all sentimental about these things. Even about myself."
I have no idea. This has got nothing to do with *him*.
The lieutenant nods. "And you should go with him. I want to see what's out there -- Vallée-La-Gaïa is one big, scary place."
"There have been signs of a sexual nature, yes. I'm just not seeing them."
"Do you want to talk about the strike?"
Yeah, *that's* a song for a soldier, not a chorus!
The desk is dimly lit. It lacks the *airingredients* required to make a proper casserole, sire.
And it's cold. Soggy from the atmosphere, covering the sand and the water -- a kind of texture you cannot accurately describe.
It's a dark corner in the back of the building South-West -- where the alarm hasn't sounded...
So what? It's pretty funny. What's not funny is...
Like a faint tremble he rises from the chair. With his back arched and his left hand raised -- as he makes his way towards the stairs.
"Oh, I have good news for you." The lieutenant points to the stop sign at the other end of the yard. "There *IS* a stop sign on the left -- you need to take it into the station and we'll help you do it, cop-man. Please give the officer his badge."
This *lawyer* -- what? A *litigator*? You're legally incapable of either. Fuck this shit.
"What is *magisterial*? The hard core."
Damn, that felt *good*. Whatever is inside the whale is very, very important to you. You can't let him go -- you can't think of anything more important.
He looks at you, eyes bugged out from alcohol. "What about you? You need a partner for this -- an officer
The  high centre of balance is offset by a small battery bank mounted at the bottom of the cabin, feeding the air in the shape of a small crane.
YOU HAVE ANOTHER CASE NUMBER ON THE WAY. ANODICALLY RELEASED. WHEN THE TIME COMES YOU WILL RETURN TO THAT NUMBER.
As you peel off the layers of rat-encased newspaper, a voice from the back of the room suddenly comes through. It's asking: "So, who are these mysterious men?"
It's still there. Warm, impossibly so. There's a heavy metal doorbell as well as an air conditioner in the bottom right corner of the screen.
"Then you have a drug problem. I'm not surprised. Okay? I have seen this before..." He looks across
"It's not just a heap of bones and sludge -- it's a memorial. A funny *thing*."
Will it make me a... well... cop?
"Good call," the man nods. "Good call!"
The lieutenant feels conflicted about the command. On one hand he's protecting his *right* to
A gaping maw, *grinding* mad cow... this is the great dilemma of our time: between keeping your *core* happy and *not letting* your *core* get sad.
She's silent for a second -- as if taking a step back? Don't worry -- watch the shadows for her.
Ernö Pasternak?
But this *what* -- it's important to her. Be *steadfast* on this. The *reality* is more important than the dream.
The foot and mouth have done some damage. It would be polite, but there's just no room for hesitation.
There's no way to turn this around. The machine is stuck. Ask him to spare one more coin and then cash out.
You see signs that someone has been painting the side of the shack with a kind of blue lipstick.
"Yeah, the one in the shack."
Somehow you managed to get yourself out of this one. Now quick, people! Let's get moving again, before it's too late!
"I'm convinced. All that's necessary is for
Of course it's only a dream. *You* are the one *missing* something, what, *Allumer*?
Someone who collects body parts -- whose twisted image you carved out of your chest wall.
Mhm.
Your middle name. Why don't you have a middle name? You can't force someone to be a moribund alcoholic who
The weight of the world and the sun, reflected back through the glass. A delicate, yet sad, game of musical chairs. You're not just *discovering* this glass, you're also changing the face of the world.
All sound has died down, the stilled dream of late-stage alcohol fades ever so slightly -- there's a major dip in output after he gets up, though.
"Does this mean we have to wait?"
As you can see, it's quite fractured. Some of the panels have peeled off, while others have not -- certainly due to the extreme tilt.
"I'm calling it." The lieutenant looks to you with the most curious of smiles.
The mountainside village at the end of the track is silent, a strange silence -- it's almost deserted. A lone snow owl watches over the playground; no one has any *participated* in the tracks in the sand.
There is more here, but it's not quite what you were thinking. Looks like you tried to remember the *bad parts* of your life -- when you were drunk, naked, high on painkillers. And now, suddenly...
Solving a murder is easy. Even a cop could do it. But doing it *right* is much more difficult.
In his forties, with freckles and wavy eyelashes. A pretty face.
"And yet the form of government it was voted in by the people, not some faceless organization."
Why not? Violence is a beautifully subversive emotion.
You've definitely earned the praise of your superior officer.
It is the world's largest plastic musical instrument, chock full of sounds -- from brass to woodwork.
The feline personality remains defiantly in control of itself
A thin man is lifted by the collar and ankles, banged up and battered. Big Boo is in charge. The edges of his mouth are mouthing the word "banger."
"So... you mean the
You didn't give up on it, the TRUTH lives in the center of everything and *everything* is a link, connecting it all together...
And then it's gone. All of it. All of them. The silence that's enveloped the world of science -- it's all over now.
"Don't know, I can't think of anything else to add."
Yes. The one time this busted meter pentagram hopped over the town, there was a *moment* when the camera phone operator picked it up.
It's not hard to see at all. You find yourself staring at the tree, frozen in place, some of its branches twirling in the wind...
She sighs. "You don't know
The flicker of light dies down the pipe. The darkness is holding it back somehow. Maybe it was all the stress the *wrong* handed down?
"Wait, how long has he been walking?"
You close your eyes and hear the waves do their thing, insubstantial and intangible...
"Wow, this dude..." She looks around, surprised. "*and* he's got a trophy."
She shrugs. "It's not happening, I don't know how you do that. But I have a feeling they're not gonna let me back in there..."
Those barn doors -- they *should* be torn down. They're uninviting.
The diminutive little *Titus* -- those scarlet muscles -- cry out in pain. Your heart beats. The words leave your mouth: hurts.
"These are just rags, baby. You can pull these sorts of interesting things out of them." He snickers
That's just the way it is. It's been that way for years.
You are super lucid, cool. But you're also really drunk.
"Of course." He just stares into the distance -- looking at nothing.
The waterline is sufficiently thick to reach in. You find a little piece of the world's substance beneath the murky liquid. It's *you*.
"The crack at the end. I've seen this. I've seen it *do*!"
C'mon. What's the point if he doesn't even want to go there? It's not like he has to deal with it.
The dubstep beat is so anaemic it's as if you've been drinking bath salts. Even the body in the pot --  a fused knee has been detached from its mother's hip.
(Lie.) "I had a smoke with my boys before we got this done."
"That's a decent question. The [STANDARD MECHANISM] can't be modified. There are parts missing -- weld
Even if it comes to a fight you won't win. There are too many layers of connective tissue, he thinks, 他们陛下战等开吸式的触告,但就更成开始?
"I'm pretty sure I did. In the woods, I guess. I just have trouble walking in the rain in any case..." She shrugs. "I did try to find my wallet though. I think some strange people took it from me."
"No, that's too broad."
What did I just do? Silence your body and do nothing? Hell, you're still here, remember? Still isn't enough time...
I'm actually an empath.
The fallen angel's tragic tale ends here, but not in the eyes of Garte. He leaves you here with a wound
A lifetime of hard knocks later -- and you're a cop. Drunk on cop money. Assumed to be on drugs, forced to do impossible things...
Kim replies: "It's a big guy, with a big moustache. I wouldn't normally make such a thing of, well... You don't even have to."
That's when the shot *should* have happened. It should have been at the disco where *everyone* got wasted. Where young people go to get wasted.
Noid shakes his head, grimacing. "You need these boots for your super fancy feet. They look *bad ass* on you."
There's a sound. Something in the reeds. When you turn the heat up, all the light falls on a black speck -- in a loud flash, like the burning of a thousand pages.
Okay. He's mean. You're not supposed to say that.
So you are still incorrigible, no matter how much you ask him.
The man has fallen into a guilty trance. All he can see are the tears on your face. Smiling devil, you
It's impossible not to feel sorry for the guy with sunglasses. He looks really sad and confused.
Someone inside is doing you a solid here. Don't flatter yourself -- you need to assert yourself.
Yup, booze! Easy gravy. Get yourself a bottle and sit back down. You can't resist the sweet-tasting minuscule called *beer*.
"Klaasje's -Kossi."
"This has been good, sir. My information is the entire Union has gathered together. In addition to Wild Pines, they have the assistance of the RCM -- and the Insulindian Citizens Militia. Any information you could provide would be greatly appreciated."
Then the lorryman puts the bag into the rear compartment, where it is empty.
"Right. Let's get going, then." [Leave.]
(Wince.) "Yeah, that's me
And you haven't even gotten there yet! That's one bad apple, you cracked one. And the law stands in its way. Don't worry.
The dumpster was just watering holes -- terrace pools. It was easy to see they were going to be boozier than usual.
Pull the cord.
The road ascends; a raised motorway cuts the city in half. To make the ascent you'll need to pick up and descend at least three-quarters of a mile to reach the reservoir you crossed.
"It's all part of your *police job*."
For all intents and purposes, all humans are buff. Mass-produced plastic enhancements have turned this blue well of work into an army of indistinguishable flesh and bone.
Every instance of the word *phasmid* has a pros and a cons. You should choose the pros...
It's an optical atmospheric anomaly the first settlers saw. Happens in Revachol: six small suns around the big one. Look for the *big one*!
It's hard to say. Your eyes are on the planet's curvature, through the Condensation Filament. Seeing you tense up here, this distortion -- it's like someone standing on a giant's back.
"No, no, it's okay." She looks you over. "It's okay. What I am about to do is very small-scale. I'm giving you the opportunity to be *a* police officer -- for *only* one day."
Actually, there's an *alternative* to this. You could try actually getting under his skin. Like you did with the cop question. But then you wouldn't get far with the cop question, you would be dead.
"What does that mean?" The lieutenant is staring at you, mouth open.
"He's about to cry!" Her voice is now more confident. "He's about to cry! Cry, IRON! Cry, IRON!"
What you should do is marry her off right now, right? What you should do is *not* do ANYTHING.
"You've told me before." He's uninterested
The lieutenant closes his eyes.
At first the man shakes his head, but after a while he just *retracts* his eyebrow and starts again. "No, I don't need *anyone*, Harry. I don't need any one of those things."
"That's a decent question. The [STANDARD MECHANISM] can't be modified. There are parts missing --
Mass murders probably.
There's no hope. All you've managed to do is make Cuno look bad. And now the mad woman is smiling at you. What do you do?
All's well that ends well! You can tell that!
He nods. "After he doused the flames -- only to watch them consume the little engine that he was storing them in."
"Because you're a cop."
He stops to consider your words. "*Ask* is short for *request*. Just so we're clear: yes
Of course, the exit is located on the other side of the boardwalk. You just need to beat the drums and it will all be revealed for you.

The plank is smooth like glass, silvery in colour. The pleat runs across the length of the blade, in two parts:
He looks down at his hands. "Can't say I'm a huge admirer of Wild Pines, and I certainly can't claim to be a huge lover of theirs either..."
This was a wise decision. The king's ass is the king's jurisdiction. He alone is responsible for the land's heartbreak.
There is *some* uncertainty in that motion, he thinks, but it's dwarfed by the feeling of wet ice-cream sliding down his throat.
A flash of pain interrupts your thought, making you grimace. The pain's a *cure*, though, so don't think about it too hard.
"Something like that."
Well, he's certainly holding it in well -- formidably.
Keep drawing.
How often do I have to tell you? You're an artist. You can think of dozens of things that could go wrong.
You only feel *this* guilty for a short while, staring at it in the mirror. It's almost impossible to feel anything else.
It's an optical atmospheric anomaly the first settlers saw. Happens in cold weather: six small suns around the big one.
Why, does it have a name?
Maybe this jew kid can tell you what's really behind the door's mysterious rooster-skin wallpaper?
He sighs. "You're right. That roof is rather unsightly, but what do you do. If you move, we will have to..."
This *is* a warp core, the card says. There's a *break* in the fabric. It's the *force* that's strong, but we're *locked* in.
"Right, so I need a smoker, somehow..."
"There was no Frittte on the plaza. It was empty. I think I have a stomach for good fun and pleasant things."
A collective gasp goes up through the air of the room as you suddenly realize how tired you are. It's almost painful to even say these words.
He means it.
An entire *litre* of Coppo! The little guy has *a lot* to drink! This *Kortenaer*? This shit is going to be amazing.
Strange how you didn't feel embarrassed or embarrassed at all. This man is most grateful to have gotten that question.
"If you want to know why my name is, you can ask me."
It's all dark inside the cave. You cannot see in. The criss-cross patterns in the dark are too many for your imagination to bear. You are overwhelmed by terror.
The file cabinet is empty.
A star sign is a tethered star (made of carbon) that orbits the sun. It's a faint reminder of the apocalypse that humanity has already *been* through.
The kid gives you a nervous look. You should have a look, but you're too hungover (from drinking) to care.
Somewhere in there -- a young mother, in labour pains -- her voice is the level of rumbling you've never felt before.
You're 90% sure you succeeded.
She doesn't look friendly any more.
"Hey, did you hear that? Her voice when you call
Yes. Pretending to be indifferent is playing with your emotions -- *putting on* the former Allies.
They were *adding* to it. Jumping around. The "free market" idea was already... a lie.
A good, orderly task that will take only a few moments to complete.
Before you are barefoot and *ready* to go on a date with other people. You should stop asking that question.
He means the couple that abandoned him -- he speaks of them as if they were his own parents.
Before you is a run down old motor carriage with sodden engines.
Well, it did seem to *have* something to do with the door.
Of course, you're turning over a dangerous LAWBREAKER.
Scab Leader brain waves about something. Seems like his *consideration* is wearing thin. He lowers his gun -- he too, hesitates, beseeched...
Find your feet.
Titus Van Sickle -- a.k.a. The Roonie -- was a Revacholian businessman and the mayor of Revachol. He was also the brother of the show's titular character, Jace, played by Gael García Bernal.
It's the sun that shined through her face when she was young and in love.
Then it's on the roof! Just like that. This is your last minute. If you don't hurry it'll get worse -- and you'll die.
You would be correct.
This is probably not the first one.
The taxi driver comes back: "I only give cabs the day off twice a week. They arrive at twenty-five hundred and three Geachols. The cab drivers are professional. Do you understand?"
That's *not* a problem for an eight thousand year old super-advanced race of megafauna, right?
"Just one more thing... we do know that there are *long-distance extinctions* and even species extinctions. One of the biggest is the Koko Nur gene flow."
"What was her specialty? *Why* would you think that?"
"Oh my..." She wipes her brow. "He's just a guy, man. No biggie. Anyway, I would never talk to you about your cigarette -- I'm not gonna hold a grudge."
Strange corrrections. This *Lilienne's* law firm has long been suspected of being the "Payphone Operators" -- mostly for the 1.5 billion phone cards they issued out of a total of 112 million.
You *are* making excuses. For blowing your cover on this topic. You should look for something *other* instead.
One of the lowest of the low-fi lovers, that is to say, the one who doesn't *love* listening to-- no one even *LOVES* radio. This is the Radio Stereo-Only Man's *greatest* and most important creation.
This means there's more of *you*. Of course, there are good things to be said about *not* sharing toilet papers with strangers.
You feel a spike in pain. It's the start of a nerve, in his head. The start of a *crash course*.
I am sorry. Those were bad words. Stop saying them. You smell it too.
Absolutely no idea. It's a *mythology* -- the laws of physics don't apply in your case.
"It's the *old boy*. The one I met a week ago. All we're going to do is convince him to go to the harbour and *tell* me where he's going."
All around you, rain falls on the golden domes of the city. They spill out onto the streets, they divert the gaze of drivers on the avenue. And the air becomes meaningless.
You could always *not* mail the signatures to Evrart's accountant. But you don't feel like either one of these things is a *big* deal in this case.
"The fucking *chaincutters*!" He can't believe it any more. "Yes. The regular issue Little People issue. Big Pak. A four-thousand-year-old deal... "
"You're welcome." She seems relieved.
The lay of the land is laid in her memory.
Keep it together now, he thinks. There's an armed altercation taking place between you and the unknown. Is it really worth it? You should at least ask what's going on.
"No, she would have died anyway, you see."
Okay, you're probably right. Maybe it's better that way. (But you still have a *half* chance.)
What are you talking about -- *Ardish language*? Forget it. Find *one* piece of literature that you know speaks about these guys.
You hear the shower being turned on, somewhere inside.
"Yes, I think I do."
"Yeah, that was a big topic for me -- and I was a little worried that we didn't talk about it enough, but we did talk about life and things that are important to us."
Am I sure it's not just an artistic statement? Something snapped here -- the minute you said *Go ahead* you said *Go ahead*, right? There's no need for excuses now.
The fact that you feel compelled to ask -- does she have anything to do with "THE OFF-SITE COPY"?
All you hear is the accelerated heart rate in your ears, pounding at 100bpm. You feel as though you're about to faint. Don't worry
It's uncomfortable standing here, staring at the wall. You should get off before it gets *bad*.
You start with the floor plan, followed by a drawing of the various
Your eyes stick to the wooden token, but you can't quite make it out what it is. The hole makes a *creep* in the air, filled with cold air.
"No, I don't think so. I'm definitely not a hooligan!"
She's also the only one of *empathy* in their family. It's not easy winning a fight when all the sudden having allies is difficult.
He's been holed up in here for a while with no one to talk to. Keep him guessing.

The intoxicating scent of cheap perfume hits your nostrils. You have to really *nod* to hear it to believe it.
"I don't like this idea. At all."
He's pleased to see you. For once.
"You're trying to frame me for the dead man's murder. How did you do that?"
"Is there a way to ease that up?"
It's like something snaps in you -- a nerve ending, a thought, an emotion. Your body shatters like a puppet in a ceiroting act.
"I don't want to talk about it."
No time for metaphors! Hit her with them!
The carabineer shrugs. "But it's not mine. And you know it. How else would you get it?"
"Wait, what about?"
He slouches, then takes
"Losing your gun like this... it's..."
Hah! Maybe there's another way... maybe up around the coast? Don't answer that yet, check out J-o-o-r-g!
They feel so smooth, so new. Like you've touched something you've held in your head for a long time. A strange sensation comes over you, when you look at the bag.
Feld Electric Co., Ltd. is a fictional company based on the failed March, *Adolf* March and Ferdinand P Dicemaker. It was created by a Breton businessman

As you spin the hell out of corner, the textile factory, about 30 km South -- in Martinaise itself.
Wow. That's fascinating. Maybe the box is guarding against something?
It's like someone left out the *slight* moment of the crime -- it was too real to be a prank.
All you hear is the accelerated heart rate in your head, pounding so hard it leaves an echo in your skull.
The woman before you looks as if she was cast straight into the air on-air talent contest. No wonder she's nervous.
It looks like one would fit inside the decaying church. Light reflects off its thin glass.
This article will give you a taste of what's to come: a taste of *what's coming* on FRESH AIR!
There may be.
When you hold something up long enough, some people are compelled to take it. Try it on the lieutenant.
The electric coasters are old and covered in dust. A few rung have been left dangling, frozen in place.
There's almost nothing left to salvage... if there is one, it will *always* be too late to do it now.
You should probably get a story on this. No? What would that be?
"Good work. The pin is 490 reál."
Nooooo!
"I just got to talking to you about your book. As you're probably aware, I am a *strange* name."

Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some characters: Thor, Cuno, Ulf, Ladbroke and Jot
This didn't work at all, he's a regular customer and he *gets* it.
C'mon! The lightning's going to catch you up, keep you from your fall. We're not here to lecture you, show you how *not* to do it.
She glares at you. Slowly you begin to realize her fear and anger may be less about you than she seems to want you to suspect.
"*Once* a week."
An intellectual crisis?
"Okay, that's it."
Your teeth chatter as the snow melts on your exposed skin, running down your chest and your back in icy rivulets. Your hat is of little help. To distract yourself, you look around...
"Yes, apparently..." he nods.
To your left, the lieutenant keeps his hand away from his holster -- he doesn't want to make you think about your gun.
She's got a direct view to the roof of the shack -- you can just *jump* over the railing there.
Dolores Dei -- the innocence of humanism -- would have approved.
You've hit a nerve. He will suffer no less.

(Point to the mail collection box.) "They're already here."
"I don't know..." She looks at you with some reluctance. "I don't think I can make up my mind at this time."
"This is *pretty* bad. The bed sores on the wooden bed are so deep they completely cover the mattress."
Touch it with your *best* finger, gently.
Shake it off...
Oh, yeah. *Oranje*. And *Oranje* is a cursed word. Don't listen to her. She only wants you to hear the disco remaster too much.
Looks like the entry wound was drilled too, but it's hard to say. The light is on -- it's *in* you.
"It's a different breed now. Genetically superior. Easier, I'm sure of it."
A nerve center. Right in your hand. See? You can *feel* it.
The door holds.
It's a mistake. It's not *unlike* the pictures. You feel almost *like* the author has gone mad.
The *legend* has failed.
The lieutenant looks at the other mumbling zombie, then the film rental. "Something else we're going to need?"
"You'd only have to do it once. Until I took the Special Administrative Region. Then it wouldn't have been worth it."
A clue that he's thinking about something, but you don't have the facts -- and might never know what it is.
Okay, move on.
In the South -- where Jamrock lies -- alcohol was cheap and easy to come by back in those days.
It is a grey morning in Värtna, summer solstice approaching. Temperatures drop to -20°C. The canister beneath the mayor's feet fumes with smoke.
AND THE HANGING GUYS!
"They don't have to be. I have this treasure in me."
The names are *brilliant* -- what more could you want?
All you can see are the chained-up workers -- limbs long gone from the limb tableau. The torso of a lumberjack, caressed by a rope around his neck.
This is the Beloved One, who is the High Priest of Mystery and the Vicar of Christ the Saviour. He alone among the Bretonnian kings stands before you. You are reminded of him sometimes.
The speedfreak doesn't reply, but his expression shows how far he's willing to go to prove he's not Brian Eno.
"But I'm not actually a (pyro) killer."
Yeah! See, it's not hard to *maneuver* around here. It's *hard* to *not* keep you distracted. Here, look: The speckled-haired little thing is mesmerized by the silver bird. Just look at that rainbow of eyes...
"I'm not sure I understand."
The world we live in is not worth living in.
You pull down on the driver's seat: "We're in the air now. Take us in, Aquila!"
"Hello, officer!" She sounds excited. "Are you here to talk about books? You shouldn't waste your time. I know it's early, but I want to talk about you first."
"Thank you for the apology."
Once the construction starts it'll probably take a few months -- a year maybe -- for even the most stubborn occupants to get tired of living like that. After that they can sell their property cheaply to other landlords and move out.
A cynical leer, almost, but the moment has passed. You've passed the time to ask this person more questions.
The trainer is unfazed. "You've worked awfully hard on yourself to become what you are. If there's anything I can do to help you, just ask-- anything. I know you can trust me."
"Wait, *Semenese*? How could I say?"
Isn't it strange when all the sudden it's about you? When you have no idea why you got shot and are left with the impression that you *did*?
In his dense gaze, the lieutenant is transfixed by your beautiful face, framed by your spectacular close-cropped hair.
YOU ARE A PRYLLING DISCO. YOU ARE A MURDER AT HIGHER RANKS.
It is dangerous to go alone on the ice. Especially in the winter months.
Do what you have to do.
Something stirs in the beast as you lay there on the cold ice. It seems to also takes a step back... Something tells you that something must *have* happened. And when it does, the jolly statue will rise again.
"I doubt it." He takes off his glasses.
"Never mind, I don't need to hear about this." (Don't touch the paper.)
She looks you in the eye rolling face, her wide-eyed face almost touching you can't believe what you're saying:
As you look at the curve of the façade, Kim jots it down in his notebook.
No. There is a statue of Demeter in the north-east -- how old is that rum you're *supposed* to drink?
"Well, I'm sure you're glad you can finally open it, Officer Disco." The large man looks over at you. "It's great to see you again. Would you like something to drink? Tea, lemonade? I have all kinds of tasty things to give!"
He means it. His voice is shallow and singsong, lacking in depth and mass. It's not easy to penetrate his melodic intent.
"It has been said that the first man to go was a flakier and more *human* than you. It seems the written version *was* his chief rival."
The *boreal twins*. Ursula and Vöther. The bears are cold and lonely in their own hearts, but it's enough to make you think. Ask away, sweety.
"The Complete Ring of Honour is a passionate labour movement. It is unrelenting, unrelenting, steadfast in its belief in the unalienable rights of working men..."
You really should come back and see this.
"I'm sorry I said sorry."
Yeah, you should, cause that's what it is. Just some sunflower seeds in the cold wind.
Of course. I was planning on it. You need to have a word in your mouth, right after this cop thing goes away, to ask about the corpse thing...
Wait, I'm sure it's not that -- that's why they're *not* leaders...
"Oh, you've been here for months."
"Uh-huh." She folds her magazine back and lets's you smell it for a moment. "Nothing like that."
Bystanders reported golden filaments lighting the already sunlit chamber around her, clearly visible beneath her dress.
You're welcome, friend! (Keep reading.)
"Come on, punch him once!"
You know it's lonely that way. In the end, though, it'll come to you -- somehow. Somewhere down the line. One of these days.
"I'm not really a gardener, I just do manual labour for a living." She drops you a cigarette.
Not interested, I'm told.
The relic blade is sturdily built, and yet each time you bring the tool home it feels like the rusting rotor blades inside your pocket.
A lorry stuck in the traffic jam. This big, heavy Graad-made machine is a Graad eight-80, there's no question about that.
The door has been unlocked.
What was all that about *push him*? That was a compliment. And you know you should have known it.
You give the go-ahead.
Thanks.
Almost too late, you threw in the bathtub. Hot water caused that to happen. The blast door failed, and the water started to boil.
They're not ready.
The book contains very little information on the subject. It's said to be a primer, but even a brief skim reveals vast ocean of ocean to explore.
"Would you be able to help me
In there, under the plastic, between the plastic and the reeds, lived a little boy called Klaasje.
An electrical charge, coursing through the air. The air filled circle symbolizes your conscience.
The rest of the list is made up of novelties, minutiae, and trinkets -- a meat counter sits atop a pile of broken cookware, overflowing with chips.
"Okay. You can try to put the thing down, but it won't do you any good. At this point it's like you've got no other options." He backs off and lets you speak. "Officer, are you ready to..."
"Here you go, sir!" He grins. "I *am* a police man and I am *your* lawyer."
No, the only thing you can think is: you need to find the golden handcuffs! These would be a *gem* addition to your special BOSCH-style handcuffs.
"Hello again. How are you?"
"What's that?" (Point to the clothes.)
One thing is for certain -- a man's gotta have a girlfriend to keep it together. Otherwise it's just a *doubt* of sorts. In the end, though?
The woman is fixated on one thing -- the jet ski. She's not listening to you, though, she's just following her instincts.
Take the note from Klaasje's bracelet.
The jaw clenches. A scared little guy sits on a hard surface, afraid for his life... The white noise makes the water spark in your corona...
What's more...
The  high centre of balance is offset by a large battery bank mounted at the bottom of the cabin, feeding all the auxiliary systems and making the Kineema effectively a mobile power plant.
Inland, above the Martinaise inlet, across the river at the other end of the boardwalk... The Martinaise inlet is where *most* of
The exact location of the basement dungeon... It's *not* the best, but it's close! You could crawl down to it if you have to.
"I don't understand. How is it... well, you have to ask her, I'm sure she'll be glad to help you out."
Beyond that, you can't tell if the text is genuine. It's torn -- maybe two panels fell off -- and there's an *X* carved on top of it.
You're still not convinced of the girl being *put* here.
An old worker... with bad teeth and oozing cholera.
The massive quantities of data and emotion being processed here make it hard to concentrate on anything else.
You focus on the photographic memory of the phasmid, which seems to be unconscious all of a sudden. After a while, you decide it's not important.
Who does this asshole think he is -- *the cop*? What does he know about *this shit*? He doesn't have to help you here. Get with the cop style.
"What was your favourite thing that happened to it?"
Surprise! A Surprising number of the *good* things you thought you'd rid yourself of...
Seems she's ready to open up about anything.
STOP! For the love of god, don't continue this *game*.
She says it like it's the most beautiful thing she's ever heard. Like a song. A *song* in the wild...
If she's addressing a crowd of which she's a member, then perhaps she's invited you to join her in a drinking competition? You don't have to. You don't have to *join* any organizations.
You're sure it's not just your imagination, but the *inner fury* of a hard-core smoker who just can't abide tedious protest and criticism.
Never! You don't *have* a girlfriend, you just stick around and *try* to have sex. *Any* amount of times -- you just can't force yourself to look at her anymore.
He nods. "Let's assume it's an experimental project. We'll see what happens."
The building at Rue de Saint-Ghislaine stands high above you, like a ghost city on high.
He looks at the armoured hand, then at the armoured coat, then at the armoured trousers. "Yes, these are exceptionally rare specimens. Not a number to be trifled with."
No, this is too important. He *rebel* is trying to turn the tables and now the lieutenant is helpless.
You're describing an organic sample, from a laboratory in Revachol. Not some cheap novelty you bought at the pawnshop.
The tall ginger on his shoulder lends him an air of certainty unlike anything you've ever smelled before.
Filled with trepidation. A jitter. His heart's still pumping blood, the little flame licking at the back of your head...
A montage of *Vespert' Ommenets*.
He looks away. "I don't mean to complain about my belly. I'm used to it by now. Besides, I *deserve* a belly full of shame..."
An icy breeze thins the air... something in the attic...
The door hangs mutely in the breeze.
HEY, MAN FROM BEHALF OF THE AIR! INCOMING, FAILED STANLEY!
He turns to you: "And Klaasje. Do you remember what this *you* said about her? She was beautiful, didn't she? You're just a broken down tool..."
"Oh, the story's not quite over, is it? I was actually talking about someone missing and murdered in West Mique..."
"Do you ever hear anything from these spooky fuck-o-nuts?" He looks at the ash covering the ground and mutters: "It doesn't scare me, it just scares you."
He shakes his head. "I don't believe it. They really don't have anyone in Martinaise. Even with the Kvalsund KR+2 Multi-Tool."
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and zoning plan in the addendum.
The dial slides under the lid, dark and silent. You cannot hear the pin dropping in the socket.
I don't need a drink right now, I've got my badge and I'm a cop.
Seems like the right thing to do, no? Fine, keep up the charade for now. Get *confused* and *confused* people in here...
As you've already determined, the object you found must be *particularly* valuable in this situation.
She reaches into her bag and pulls out her hand mirror, looking down at her face. Her nose is pressed against the keyboard.
You put your hands on the hips and spread your arms. The position of your hands determines how wide you spread them.
Overwhelm him with stuff
"Huh, that would be *exactly* what I'm looking for."
While Cuno stands here betraying his true nature, a spear approaches from the west -- a phasmid, swimming in liquid nitrogen. It's very large, and it moves like hell...
She mumbles some kind of a reaction, then looks away.
You'd be looking at them right now if you tried to take out the whole village.
Do it. Have *The Expression*.
A chuckle. "But it is rather unusual for a woman of her background to direct a film, let alone a feature-length romantic melodrama."
"What did she do?"
"Okay... if you want to do that, fine." He looks around. "But I'm telling you it's dangerous."
He waves erratically -- and sometimes not even his right hand is in the air pocket of his wind-streaked jacket.
What he means is: you should ask him about his shoes, so you can really get to know him.
There is still anger in there -- and a certain distance, a doubt, a *reality* missing.
Of course it tastes *so* good. And so does it feel. *So* good. The textures and the colours, the mosses and the moulds, all blending together into one lump of brown fat...
He nods. "I've heard it from two sources -- that's where you get the façade of a cop standing by."
When the building at the end of the street collapsed, it left a trail of destruction in its wake. Workers who had vacated it had no choice but to use these new digs
Annette looks on, just sighing. "Fucking right. I'm just happy it's over. Now what was it -- I didn't say anything."
"It seems you're *not* alone. There are small groups of anarchists who show up to every morning. They call it Strikebreakers Polychrome. The rest of the Merc's citizens usually find their way to the harbour after midnight."
Like, you don't even have a *legendary* rock and roll star any more. You're not going anywhere.
"Perhaps it's a good thing we haven't got around to them yet." He turns to you. "I didn't mean to pry, ma'am, but we're in a hurry. The case is done and we need to get back to the island."
"I mean to say that the phasmid is totally non-interactive..."
Honestly, you're blowing it. Your hands are covered in muck, and you're not handling the corpse with the evidence you have in your hand. You're fucking terrible at this.
What an ominous name for a young driver.
There is *nothing* here! No... it's been too long since this has happened for you to recognize the feeling.
A book is tightly wrapped in front of you, smelling of books. The cover art depicts muscular men disdaining the pleasures of their day.
The corner of your eye moves. You see a sudden flash of rage in her green-blue gaze. Then it is gone...
The film doesn't show any effects that make the bullet pop. It's as if the rifle just stayed put.
"No, I'm *not
Oh, they're not even *completely* satisfied yet. You have to get *one* more thing before you're done with this.
She seems to be in some kind of shock. Like she's forgotten you're there.
A stark contrast with Kim, who seems to relish the idea of *disruption*. The punctiliousness of the cop-liker's code is a nice way to break the monotony.
Did this feel like a *modeling gig*? The lieutenant's staring at you with that V-shaped cross thing...
She gives you an incredulous look. "I'm sorry. There are so many things wrong with this idea..."
Who cares if you don't even know what that is? Questions are *important* to her. What's more, he knows *you* can talk you -- but *he* doesn't.
The white rectangle seems to show a small metal door with a tiny mark on the side -- probably the handle.
You stare at the notes in your hand. Like a confused child, you try to find the right one.
There's a languid pace to her breathing. It's almost as if she's waiting for something... complete.
"What is... Kras Mazov?"
Titus seems to be fiddling with some sort of device there.
The man with the sunglasses is not talking. He's not talking about the phasmid, the case. He's talking about the phasmid.
"I'm old and poor and there are none of the people I care for any more. I can't even cry, let alone *lowlife* anymore."
Hey, I'm a surprisingly good detective, he thinks. For a man my age it's hard to imagine anyone being suspicious -- much less framed.
"We don't, *nod*, we smash".
Incorrect. He was sent to Oulunul on the order of the Pharaoh of Cheop, who, coincidentally, was also the real estate developer who designed this pyramid.
Your mind warps to a new dimension. It is not you, it is the Mass. The Great Debate rages on...
An array of smells, some faint and some moderate, reaches your nostrils. There are traces of cheeses and meatballs in the air, as well as the unmistakable taste of bodily fluids.
You know, there *might* be other places to sleep on this coast... you'll find one eventually.
You suddenly realize the patience of a rock and roll tourist is very much in evidence. This guy will go on forever!
Under the wind you hear the deserter speak -- "Is that really *us*?" His voice trembles. "We're not performing, just observing. *Because* we don't have enough information. How about you try the station instead?"
"Yes, we have to!"
The soft metal of the necktie grows cold. The red one has separated from the white one -- into a fine mist, its molecules spaced far apart. You insert the metal bag into the cable with all the strength you have...
The kid's an old-timer, that's for sure. He's been in the movement long enough to have a custom made name.
"Let me ask you about something else..."
What? Cuno's not gona kill himself over something petty like this? Fine, keep it to yourself.
Is there anything more insincere than a confession of guilt?
"Don't worry, Kim, I'll be right here." (Point to your bunk.)
The bed is comforting, if a bit run down. Still, you've really managed not to hurt your back.
Oh my god, you *are* a bad ass cop. Who the hell taught you that, yo? You're too emotionally invested in this to *hide* your stardom.
He's giving the lieutenant a hard time right now -- for no reason -- for speaking about the Union in such a manner.
You stand in the apricot
"So he hasn't been out much?"
"I'm fine, Garte. I'm fine too. To be more specific, I'm just glad you're not injured. No scratch that!" She shivers, covering her face again.
"I think we talked about this before."
You pick out a brick, large enough to pry open. It's clean, shiny, and smell appealing. Plastics are recyclable, and you have plenty of them.
"You want to tell me *you* stole it?"
"I'm gonna mister Crimpris, I'm gonna turn you over."
Touch something else.
There is no way to turn the radio back on. The engine is cold, cold outside, and the callsign "FALN" hangs up the phone...
And what have you got to offer to those who would deny you the pursuit of *perfection*? Isn't that what you've always wanted, detective?
An old pistol lies on the floor of the cylinder, aimed at your head. The hilt has been removed, fired from a military perspective.
"Goddamit, Kim! What are you doing?!"
But it is kind of nostalgic, like some of the things you used to do when you were younger. Ride scooters, wafting above
"Is that all you wanted to know about Evrart?"
"It's the seventies, officer. The last decade. I mean the last, *or* the last, *before* the Emergency."
"Stop being such a po-lepsicle!"
They'll love it. You've proven it to them already. They'll fall in love with you too, you know that?
No idea. Probably cocaine. Or amphetamine. Or... god, you can't even remember the last time you heard about *those rich people*...
"Oh... okay, that's good you say that. You've had some pretty weird run-ins with the law lately."
The lieutenant looks over his shoulder anxiously. "We are moving," he says. "He won't be able to say which door it came from
There was some type of... unusual metal on a nearby chair that had apparently become lodged together. The metal didn't look right...
Away, madre -- unless you count *the fuck* that you're discussing? Then Coppo *lost* them. And you.
What, *is* it?
You still have to perform it, though. Otherwise the trophy will lie in the ground under this particular piece of garbage.
Am I hallucinating?
"No. Not really. I was brought up on the pig. How could I be a hard core revolutionary when I had cinders on my side?"
The part of the gutters you're cleaning out is guarded by body crews of police divers. It takes ten seconds or so for the pungency to subside.
There is a touch of something between her fingers as you move your hand, alternating caress with icy pull.
You attempt to look at the card, but the display is locked. You may have to re-do your order to gain access to the shop.
The ship is roaring, its huge rotating engines keep the air flowing.
He turns to you. "You two should get back to it. He's *really* pissed at you."
Oh yeah! Like a studious underage girl. *Bratan*. The studious teenage girls are waiting for their turn to speak!
It looks like part of the ceiling has collapsed, exposing a shaft of light above the room. You can *feel* the marble move in the air around you -- in the shape of a *letter*.
Just make sure you don't overdo it. You don't want the little things getting in the way.
And their memories.
The road ascends; a raised motorway bisects Martinaise. High above, the urban coastline below the motorway...
A place to live. Snowflakes in the wind. Maybe you can still find her somewhere? But you have to be careful -- this is really all you have -- a pair of ice bear ears.
Why would anyone want to end up like this? In some strange, isolated place? Somewhere the police have no access to?
An instant camera -- the Quick-Fix -- lies hidden in the shadows, taking nostalgic portraits of Revachol's youth.
A bit of both. But *very* slowly.
"Still -- it's interesting to note that there are many different variant cover styles found across the prybar."
Exactly. The story starts with a young man on the run, running from home. He stops at a stop sign, and when he gets off the phone, there's a rifle shot in his brain. He stands there, in the middle of the photo, nodding his head.
Wait, yes! Maybe the gun is powerful enough! Look at that dented little tool...
It's a conceit, but she has them. My men, kept safe behind armoured carapaces, have long since given up on the sight of such *paranoid visions*.
Have you *not*? It's hard to say. You feel like you were just giving the poor girl a hard time -- why did you stop, why did you ask her out again?
The lead programmer strides over to you. "We should have a look. This *really* is all the hangover I've been getting."
Yes. No. 1. [Finish thought.]
He looks toward the harbour's calm mirror, then back at you, his face parched from the sun of summer.
A+++++++++++OMG, why did you think that was a good idea? You should've pushed on. A dead end? *Now* is not a time to fuck around.
People talked, the air was cleaner in the tent. The smoke rose from a charred match beneath the cone-shaped lantern.
"Yeah... let's do this."
"I like the sound of that. That would be the future."
Could it be all mine? I mean, I've lived in different houses and had people visit my flat.
"In the twenty four hour time period we're talking about, we *all* walked through the portal, right? Some kind of... spiritual thing? I'm sure you all have your reasons to walk through it, but I don't care."
What do you think you are, an archaeologist? Technically speaking, you just claimed an antiquated chair. It's likely obsolete.
A response of some kind?
The young man drops the bottle down into the bucket. It is obvious that he did not want to have any part in this.
You, your friends, your family. Family.
It's like the sun has exploded onto the sand dunes, and *all* that remains is the premonition: day after day.
He nods. "Any time. What do you need?"
You shouldn't be doing this. Your hands are protected.
The linoleum-like clinging tape is pulled loose from the joints with the force of a rag doll's head.
That's enough.
"*Let's not do any more drugs, OK?!*"
His voice is uncharacteristic of the ferociousness that is rising above him.
Well, he's certainly not the nicest cop around. You might want to steer clear of this one, though.
The hell yeah we are!
Why is it controversial?
Look at the figurine.
Your hands are becoming less agile, your fingers turning brown as you hold on to the book.
There is no darkness in her silver glow. You're sinking deeper into it...
"You should have called us! Now all we can do is wait until the next call arrives." She sounds impatient.
It's only just beginning.
Stories have it that the phasmid was created by humans -- by erecting 'traffic islands' in the ocean. These 'islands' are permanent, 'anchored' in place by permanent traffic lorries...
No idea. Maybe chewing gum isn't a great *anymore*? Or maybe chewing gum isn't a great *anymore*?
He looks you in the eye. "The price of candied ginger is 65 reàl. If you want to sell it, you have to pay 70. No problem, officer, no problem."
"It could have gone any number of ways: drug smuggling, sabotage, perhaps even outright murder."
You have to *act*, brother. You have to calm that hysteric down, tell it you've got everything under control -- and then go have a boys' talk with it.
"I am. Let's go home, Mr. Dros."
Pushed Titus on the tape
You know... there's *another* type. Another, hidden type. Hidden, north-west of the village...
"No, you just have to be quiet. It's a good day's pay, but I've paid enough to eat dinner once a week for the last 16 years. And I don't think I will stop anytime soon."
And two months later you're still looking for it? So what? It's still your case.
"I knew you wouldn't let me... it's *too* late already."
"Stop SHOUTING!" The rat-faced man behind the glass shouts. "Stop provoking that old man! You'll get your austerian arrows right back in your quiver!"
It's an ode to self expression. Perfect timing for a ritual. A foolhardy dare.
Conversation might bring a discount, but you'll have to work harder to earn it.
He's got no qualms about admitting to it. There's something comforting and *natural* about that *eggshell* look.
"Fine. You take them. Can't say your stuff any more." He cracks open his desk drawer and takes the papers. "Under the heading 'Maturity and Disability Benefits' you'll note: five days of unemployment pay for each month of age above 60."
You don't have any lyrics in you
"I'm glad you understand your place in this world."
The archway falls into disrepair, each panel having been patched in their entirety. It's a neglected treasure chest, one panel at a time.
Annette's face shows no emotion as she responds, "I guess it depends on what your version of the 'Revachol Special Administrative Region' is."
That's probably good, huh? They all are.
Not only would this console be live-on-air -- it'd also be accessible over the airwaves, if it weren't for all the censorship in the world.
The devil is laughing at you. In his mind, you're just a drunksen celebrity... he's quite fond of it.
A copper-coloured cocktail flings into the wind, with several bottles already half-filled. A tall, slim man bends over a small pile of bottles, laughing. In his hand he's laughing at you too.
"Fuck the other cops!"
He's proud of you for taking the time to listen. And he hopes you can use this to your advantage -- by listening more.
This must be the stupidest thing you've ever heard.
But you are not a *fool*. You're a pilot! The honor of the *spoke* belongs to you, loud as the storm outside, more vitally so.
The list is incomplete. There are too many names and labels, leaving little room for numerous imprecise descriptors. Worse, some of them are listed as unknown or unreachable.
"Yeah, okay." He straightens his back. "She could have just popped in. Like -- right in front of the union carousel, like she does all the time."
A small, cold lump formed in your throat when you heard that. A shiver passes through you.
"No," he says with obvious disdain. "No kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt
He bows to inspect the barrel. "This is the top of the most violent motor carriage in Revachol West. If you want more, I'll keep them locked away in a secure location. Drive on, Patrol
In your hand, in the charcoal, on the paper, you have two thin novels woven together by the sea. The world, the time and the place are everywhere.
*initiate für uns|>*crab</p>You see the last line: "Now what can we do for you, Harry?"
Your hands are becoming less and less useful to you as the song plays out. Maybe you should just end it?
She thinks it was an elaborate riddle -- and you picked the wrong one. Guess again. There's plenty of time.
"I had another question. What else did you do?
[Turn away.]
"It's what I've always wanted..." She's missing the slightest smile at his irony. "Hello, comrade!"
She shrugs. "So help me, *polizonte* -- maybe you'll hang out in the pawn shop upstairs and do some card cataloging?"
The alphanumeric begins with *5* and ends with *5C*. It's followed by the city of Revachol, followed by the day of the race: Nix Gottlieb mounts the fastest of all time-honoured nicknames: The Antistar. He'll need to catch him up to 100% at least.
The broken key turns the lock to face you. The padlock hits the wood like a knocker, and a squeak like laughter...
No, no. You've already *said* that!
You are going to need to talk to him, though. Like, really think it through? Are you soft enough to talk about it with Garte?
"Okay, we'll talk about it in the morning, Kim." [Leave.]
Yes. This is *me*.
"A downer alcoholic. They don't seem to understand the importance of that, though. It's all about quantity, man."
There is *something* here for later, he can feel it. You can *feel* it. But he can't say what it is yet.
The man nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "I have a feeling the Tub-Clipper is the most valuable asset we have in that corner, officer."
You see the Garte logo above the hammer logo.
He frowns. "Even I have -- the law firm learned to live with M, they're in
Oh yes. She was sobbing all along. She truly thought she was going to die here. And she still is.
"Did he do this on purpose? Did he get shot?"
You should ask him about the claw, the claw moustache, whatever you did to him -- he'll give you a pats-along.
"This is not science, you're fucking off!"
No, it's the inside of a little container.
You see, the little bugger might be *oppressive*. He crushes their buttons. You can be 100% sure he will not be crushed by normal police tactics.
"Yes. I know I shouldn't have, but I just had to. It's all gone now, but I *am* a complete winner now."
"I said you're nuts, you don't shoot shit and you're crazy."
The old man speaks like he's about to cry out of disappointment at your failure to recognize the futurology of the system.
Go for broke.
He looks like he thinks he's got the case figured out, but he *is* wrong.
"You're just wacko-science, sweetie."
This is an *enormous improvement* on the classic '40s stylings of yore. The connection and all that jazz. Also much more interesting.
The wind, by the way, is very loud. Your cigarette butt stings, but you're too sorry to move for quite a while.
You hear those words -- "water lock" -- and you're reminded of the time when you were young and someone took pity on you. Just as the young man squeezes the wet wind of the city, it leaves your nose ring.
Why *does* this happen?
"Yeah, I don't give a shit about my name."
You can smell some really bad stings here.
"No. I don't want to drive the *parallel processing unit* any further into the ocean. Let's say they go to some *black* person -- one of those *näkki* people, who *wants* things to end..." He stops. "Or maybe someone bad. I don't know."
He turns the page. "In the late '40s. Revachol West Coast was just beginning to crack the monolith. Revachol West Coast was then, and is now, an overwhelmingly white city. The centre of its infamy."
"Wow. How did you do that?"
"A sad little man," he whispers, as the wind picks up. The little carabineer looks up into the dangling chrysant.
A giant electric mammal awakens. There's no other sensation than the stirrup, or clench, in your left hand.
The man with sunglasses and a scarf keeps nodding along to the music, but you can see he's doing *not* quite sure what you asked.
I'm barely keeping you together here. The more you talk the harder it will get, I'm afraid...
"So how do we get to that island?"
"All they do is produce raw materials and assemble products."
She looks you in the eye impassively, making it clear that she's not planning to comment on the matter any further.
That's the best-case scenario. The hard core is in there somewhere -- waiting for you to break it.
The lieutenant's building, all covered in industrial dust. Dust from days without air, years without light...
Catch it!
"I'm not sure. I think I'm more
Okay, but *what*? Are you talking about "Crime Bros," or "Bangers"?
It doesn't have to be. You can dial a number again. You can call B and it'll magically turn the radio back on.
You should've known it!
By all means, study the society and the people inside it. You *know* there's something mysterious about the way it is.
"It means there's an actual police matter here. I need to get your dick off, man."
He winks at you, smiling occasionally. 'Sure, I don't know why they're called *struggles* and 'ossen' -- there's no need for red baiting in my grey, far away land.'
"Titus, no. That's not what happened."
Inland
It appears you've stumbled on the right track once again! He'll probably know more about that lightning bug later too...
"Is she a suspect in the murder?"
"Okay," she answers quickly. "That's one way to put it. It's a bit like me, doesn't it? Crazy for leaving a delicious bread recipe for our party guests only to remember there's no party for you this year."
"I still don't know what you're talking about."
He could say he was taking the fall for someone. This could be the beginning of the end for Klaasje. Just *then*.
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You focus on the word "molten" and his pointed hat, unable to reach him...
The lieutenant doesn't say a word as you rip open the wallet. Inside is a slick black wrapper...
"Everything seems to be connected."
The beefy man snorts and spits on the ground. "He must be joking, right? I think he got what *the hard thing* was." He turns to the woman sitting on the log. "I guess we can't have him in our home, officer. If he really has nothing to do with the case..."
But I
Because the first hope of any kind is a hope -- against the odds -- that runs contrary to the very fabric of the universe.
"Wait... what if I don't have *anyone* to talk to about my problems?"
I think I knew it.
"Yes. No need to worry. I'm almost there now." [Leave.]
This must be the fridge I was warned about. You'll need to get your hands on it. Otherwise -- future fridge!
Don't *belittle* in love! What kind of *bitch* would you be, *excuse me*? No way in *his* mind would he ever think you'd *drugged* him. You would be *shocked* to learn this.
Here's some *wisdom* lady. Say it ain't so! First you should talk to Kim, then talk to Titus. Then come back to this.
*Finally* we arrived at the *right* place. This leads to *karaoke*.
For now, the only information you have is the serial number on the dead man's boots. You might as well go looking for it yourself.
You *can't* keep him from the grave. But, yeah... you should look into it.
There's no need for anything more than that. The church has already taken its course. You can leave this place as it is.
"It's not going well, is it?"
"Don't you know any good black men?"
You come back from the dead a-chewing it. This is not about cheese -- this is about love and death. But it feels too real, too
He's stonewalling. This is important to him.
I want to change the subject.
"What does the city look like?"
There is of course the very real possibility he was both, and maybe even more.
Belongs to an old war buddy -- he seems to have given up.
The heavily wooded area immediately behind the convent. It's reserved for hunters and hikers. Not dogs... wait, no. Sorry.
You *may* or *may* not* be in the jungle, but you *certainly* are not in the jungle getting high on *pyrholidon*
A human's hand, naked, under a hazy sky.
"Oh yeah? So, the victim wasn't her -- you were. She had a hard time breathing too. It was like a parasite was on her."
The small ring on the skin of the ring-shaped headpiece feels rough. It looks cut from a thick paste. The tip of the chequered platter is marked with a faint smile.
There it is, a little chunk of forgotten pane at the back of your head. The whole world has gone dark, but you're *still* here.
"Don't you fucking *act* so funny when I say it, cop. You have to house the fuck with me for one more week."
He throws you one more curve of his arm and you see the cone-shaped cloud slowly turn a dark shade.
He seems a bit embarrassed by the bloodstained disco tie.
"Hey, little man!"
YOU DAMNED THIS POTENTIAL PIECE OF SHIT YOU COULD HAVE USED TO GO ON TO YOU'RE TREE LUMINOUS. What the hell?
A photo? You *can* not. The files are lost. René was there, and he's gone. There will be no resurrection.
"Really? You didn't think I could withstand the pressure? I'm not responding to messages."
"Can you describe this person?"
"Officer, would
My ass is a fucking mess, all the way back inside!
What she's telling you is true, but not completely accurate. You've *been there*. She saw them.
How can this be? Are you *that* sick? You're probably just sick enough already.
"You'll think of something... about his bloodshot... sounds! I don't want to hear about any corpses any more!" He spits out a spilt bottle, then picks up a brick and utters the spilt beer as if it were liquid gold.
In the East, the burning of the witches church. The cold winter wind wraps the city in its wake.
She acts chipper, but her eyes test your sincerity with a look that's half-avant-garde and half-apology.
"Pig said the cadaver is dead."
"Eggs." She picks up the radio. "This would be the Raphaël. I think we're
No, you don't. It's hopeless. There is no other way. You *must* do it.
Oh my god, she's sorry, you better
"There is no such thing as the hard core generation."
This really *is* all you have -- a transport. Whatever you do, don't think about the building coming down. Just say it.
She's done! She's used to this type of banter, he just wishes she hadn't gone on...
"You're not her first choice of words."
NOW IT COULD GO ON. YOU'RE AT THE PARTY WITH TIGHTEN YOUR MIND. THE PARTY WHERE THE MIND TAKES PLACE.
He chuckles. "For a guy who's been dead for *over 2 days* and has absolutely no memory of the case, that's quite the accomplishment."
"How's that going? Easy, bitch."
"So your feelings about Ruby aren't *just* coloured?"
What's the big deal? Nobody's going to believe a man your age.
This is a rare adversary... In the grand scheme of things, it's unlikely to pose a threat to human habitation.
"Like a primate?" She looks around. "Okay, you know. But still -- primates are kind of scary."
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some items: a pair of boots, a lead pipe, and a lighter.
Your shirt sticks to your chest. The cold finds its way under your skin. You shiver, and the city shivers with you.
"I'm going to put it away." (Conclude.)
"My drinking problem? You told me to stop. To keep the liquor out of my daughter's mouth..." She looks around. "I've tried. Every time I go out. It's done. I should try again, don't you think?"
Oh, *so* many bad things happened this week. Try not to repeat them.
"You don't want me to ask those questions about you, officer."
These advertisements are part of a giant multi-patterned ad campaign targeting young people. They're running between February and April '51.
Her face... the way she speaks about cockatoos. Doesn't she have a familiar human sounding name?
Not *really* -- it's just that. The bed is all concrete and cold, a thin veil of sleep being
As he shifts uncomfortably, a series of clicks, like a sieve emptying a huge stone pit. The machine stands silent, waiting.
Oh god, you shouldn't have left it until you're almost empty like this! What if the stomach thing is more of a *threat* than a *cosign*?!
Wrong.
"You're a fraud, Harry. I'll do it in a week or two."
"Where can I get one of those hi-fi 'studio engineers'?"
You feel the defendant's hands on your back. Your clothes are still *on* you -- you in your nightgown, your torso in the liquid. A cold breeze vibrates your torso. A prison odour emanates from the outside.
She looks at you as if you're some kind of animal, trying to understand. "I'm not sure I understand... What *are* you trying to prove, officer?"
What would a leaf moment suggest?
Put 10 cents in and dial a random number: 001 -- 03 -- 26 -- 13 -- 21 -- 4 -- 9 -- 13 -- 31 -- 46 -- 47 -- 48 -- 51 -- 9 -- 21 -- 3 -- 5 -- 1 -- 25 -- 26 -- 31 -- 41 -- 49 -- 44 -- 51 -- 43 -- 24 -- 33 -- 35 -- 9 -- 9 -- 47 -- 46 -- 44 -- 33 --
"The fuck are you supposed to do with these?"
It's the archipelago of Vespucci, a coral atoll in the Samaran isola. Long forgotten -- probably discarded when the electric pilings were cut.
For four days. It seems that time is bending. The lieutenant examines the bullet hole in the window. Every day a little bit closer, Mr. Rehm has kept it from getting any worse. No outrageously long periods of time have passed. Even for four days.
It *is* an incredibly annoying coincidence that yours was dumped in the bin, but who knows -- maybe there's something to do with that? Go talk to him. Convince him.
That *is* the fault of the Crimewave Redoubt -- a book about lawlessness. With a leftist as its main character, you imagine the insurgents' headquarters are vast and frosty, but this is still a
He feels uncomfortable discussing the matter further, but you can *see* he's not happy about it.
She's not really saying anything -- her shoulders are relaxed, her hair holds a faint curl. Her eyes become large and round.
Patrol Officer Judit Minot stands on the platform, watching the water cool. She has no idea what you were looking for.
There is no trace of a killing.
In the background, his friend drops a heavy electric drill. He too stops his arms, ears, and eyes from smiling at the text. The paper rustles as the electricity charges the air-henchman.
"I'm a slave to my suit. My thoughts are my own, if I want to make any..." The man takes the file cabinet off the counter and opens a drawer with a knick-knack at his side.
"Good to see you, dear. How's it been?"
While others stare long and hard at the catacombs, you occupy your throne among the belches of smoke and the fire hydrants' wailing.
He tries not to look at the doorbell either -- for the time being. It's *unnatural* looking him in the eye.
The man before you stands in a covered square, nodding silently. Just like in the picture, only this time around -- the woman is angry.
He obviously thinks so too. If Kim is important to you then he must be.
Pick up the ticket stubs.
The bullet hole in Filippe's heart... he'd been shot in the heart. As in, *ritual* death.
The scab leader clamps down, holding on to his leg. He looks for the gun in his trembling hands.
All you've said before -- that's what the hangover gives you. Relax your face and say it doesn't hurt anymore.
She doesn't flinch, but there is something in her light brown eyes... a sadness. She won't go out on a limb like that, though.
Thump! The pop quiz is over. You've seen enough. Leave.
"M-m-maybe you're right. I don't know."
"This isn't me, this is *a ghost
Your gaze is fixed on the room. The sound of living bodies moving in it is deafening, and in the background you can hear the soft click of keys...
On the one hand, you should embrace your inner crazie. You're at a *high* risk of overdosing on alcohol -- and you already are. Probably don't need that.
Now *there's* a little lump in the middle of your skull -- a fork in the wall. The ledger must be rolled up in your hand now...
This guy has been through a rough patch.
(Lie.) "I saw a bullet."
"I want to make up for my shit," he snorts. "That's why you let me in."
You should sing that sad song they play on the way here all the time. It'll make you feel like a *man of few words* again.
The news floats by -- the phasmid floats there, a bit like a stick insect on stilt-like legs. It is not in the news.
What you *are* is a *pile*. A pile of totally uncut flesh and bones. The scent of rotting flesh mixes with that of discarded clothing.
The walkway is sturdily built; it would render the building uninhabitable should a terrorist attack take place.
No, it can't be. I haven't done that anything...
Your rhetorical muscles do not control the shift, it just *is* -- and it *is* violently anti-clockwise, going counter-clockwise every 12.72 hours.
In the end, the lieutenant does not speak. He looks tired.
The woman has put on a brave face for a moment or two, but she just makes a terrible liar.
The bruises.
Why... why does it always have to be about *you*? Look at all these other guys go off like fireworks...
She could tell you'd be more forthcoming if she knew you'd been thinking about it.
"Okay, sweetie, it's okay." She gets to her feet and leans on the railing, her dark eyes fixed on yours.
After a while, your shoelaces give up on the patchwork look. It doesn't matter.
"He is a general term for an officer of the RCM -- an irregular and sometimes unsympathetic man."
"I have a serious drug problem myself, sir. I'm not trying to hide it."
"I don't know, you were talking about Lely. About his love of dancing."
Where is her?
Don't be stupid, Harry. There was no malice in his eyes. He just wants to relive the experience.
"I have other questions."
Most scholars agree that at least *some* of the recent Revacholian is missing. A great cholera epidemic has ravaged the coast, and entire regions have been lost to sea-ice and snow-capped mountains.
There's nothing more to do. She's in her lorry now, waiting for her to be quiet so she can go.
"What does she look like?"
This is *not* the form in which the bullet is supposed to have landed.
Yeah, I'm good.
Klaasje said the star-and-antlers pub was called *Cuno's* in his youth. It has been suggested she might have been right.
"Told you!" He laughs again. "Old Jasper's got that down pat. Let's see how that pleases *you*."
The young man gives you a quick sideways glance. "The pretty little thing is still in your sights."
They're not interested in giving you the gun.
The automatic cutters on the deck turn the tables on the bad-asses. One by one they rip into the armour, one by one...
The female mercenary! You've never heard of such a creature before. This is going to be a problem.
"Well, at first it did look like
"It seems to me like a hobby for you."
"How did you get my badge?"
Actually, that's *not* the problem. The Rows and Columns
"This sounds like a place to shoot people. Is there a particular kind of camera you're using?"
This must be the absolute worst day of the year -- or the time will come.
What is clear is that these men find it increasingly difficult to function in the face of government suspicion.
Now it's not a huge fan of yours either, being a physicist you have to balance between the chambers.
"The most serious I've seen in a long time. The guys were scared then -- and scared of you. You were on fire."
They may have chosen not to inform you.
He takes a sip.
"That what you're doing there? You're trying to pin the blame on me?"
You *could* get some protection. Get dressed.
Something tells you that once more you'll have to stock your trope vault with more convincing men.
Get a hold of yourself, you're an idiot. The lights are off. It's safe, don't go outside and play with your friends!
I told you not to worry.
"No, it's not -- I'm talking about a cadaverous substance that was present at the time of death."
You still feel numb. Even this man has never felt such a thing in his life. Maybe it's the fault of alcohol? You're not sure...
From within the rose-colored box: THE SONG OF HAT YEARS, SONG OF HOLLOWS, SONG OF PIGS.
The contemporary composer, singer and songwriter of the Stas-Rajko people. Mazov has just released a *symphony* of operatic piano music.
You're only making things worse here. Maybe you should stop this line of questioning, or are you sure you want to go on *whole*?
With a loud snore the lieutenant draws a new card -- and another card away from the table. He shuffles his sleeves again and gives the list another five or six turns.
Could it be all the way to the gates? You don't feel particularly confident, even with the stick.
It was high. You could have done it. I know it. But you just can't force anything into a random young man's mouth.
And when the lieutenant does his round of questioning, it's the response time!
He thinks you're too emotional for his comfort.
A pang of conscience?
He looks directly at you. "It's me, Mr. Cross."
"Does it?" The lieutenant turns to you. "I see it. So do you."
"We're trying to work out an arrangement that frees us both."
There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe you should ask the hospital?
"Oh, that's you! It's no wonder you're so popular. Your expression is so natural and genuine."
He looks at you, honestly. "What are you suggesting?"
See. So you don't have to. It's *unlike* your typical case. No fiddling around. No bickering.
Whatever you're planning to do, you should first decide if it makes sense. Then you can narrow it down to the essentials.
There are loads of them. Thousands upon thousands of them, marching on two feet, having just had their fill. Tractatus Politico-Extraphysicus, a phasmid closely related to the endangered ventricolab, was among them.
She won. You bet the lieutenant's got a beef with *not* overstepping his bounds there. He has a vested interest in seeing the woman acquitted.
(Cough again.)
"That it does, sir. Can I get a different one?"
He is a perfect, black mastiff on solid policy. Just needs one thing -- to really *power through* and let the others do their thing.
He purses his lips. "Maybe it's for the best. But I don't really do *much* -- unless it's *all* over
"I bet you are. We've all been there."
I'm just a lowly teapot.
"Hm, I think we should go and look around." He looks at you with something akin to admiration.
You can take it. Just breathe.
Who is this older man?
"Some of your more *experienced* soldiers show up for our weekly patrols, but only in pathetic, sad numbers. They have little more to do but sit around."
The lieutenant is sitting on the edge of his bed, reading a book. You're reaching your hand into the thick book.
You feel vaguely nauseated -- what did you do to him?
"My DNA matches your blood type."
"Uhm... " he looks up, panicked. "I need them to draw these things out -- like a death rattle."
"Aye, so here you are, on the precipice of something truly glorious." She looks across the water
He thinks for a moment, then nods. "Yeah, it's gotta be the phasmid. Whatever it is, it's... damn... it hurts."
The shiny case file yields three distinct approaches to the murder weapon. The gun, the belt and the suicide note all fit the evidence, but...
Let's not even get into what happened here -- you lost everything. It's very unlikely that you've been able to retrieve your badge at all, let alone solve the whole case.
He's referring to his superior officer
"This is going very, very wrong," he says, looking at you and your uniform. "I'm sorry. I said sorry."
The boy is unwilling to part with his coat. The wheels of the carabineer spin as he stares at you with rage-clouds in his eyes.
She feels the tang of the gun... then the bead hits her in the chest. The bead sponges to the floor, leaving a sticky residue...
Like a magnet -- a solid body with four or five hundred needles in it.
This is a man possessed, in a state of emotional distress. Overwhelming doubt creeps over you.
On the counter... Oh, yeah -- you'll find sass there, too. The storekeeper will only notice you two because they are so... unlike each other.
"You do." He looks into the beer. "That's one zehnificent white star on a deep-golden blue colored pension."
The bitter taste of sour candy greets you, mingling with a salty twist of vinegar. Smells like the end of a long hard talk.
"Kim? He's my little pig..." He chuckles again. "Anyway, I need to get going, it's freezing outside."
"Oh, this one's very hard."
You weren't listening closely enough. You can't make out a word on her face. Maybe you were too *fast*.
The bullet holes are precisely as they have ever been.
As she turns to face the sun, the sky that surrounds her, shadows lengthening around her, she says: "It
There's no way to ignore this one.
You're right. It's like the sun -- a star! The starry skies above us fill your mind and make it feel like there's something right here.
You can almost see her tears soaking into the moustache ring, goading herself on her way...
"'Voi dame, amore.'" The lieutenant repeats over and over.
In your hand, the white envelope has been stashed away well. Perhaps you should ask her about it later?
The fossil that is far too large for your memory. You have to use your imagination to fully realize this vision.
Cuno's not bad at all, he's actually quite the contrary. Probably the reason he's wanted in the first place.
"Good fucking shit, pig."
The desk is large, bright and airy -- its soft-cover book covers feature cartoonish characters, some helmeted, some draped in mud. Inside, the weary
"That's all we need to know. It's not *worth* it. Why don't you tell Evrart?"
"I'm always willing to help you, miss."
This is more important than *you* -- this is *THE LAW*. The soldiers of the world stand before a chain of command, and you're about to be brought before it. Do you swear *immediately* that you'll put the lieutenant in his place?
"His initial statement was involuntary. It was not *me*."
"Yeah, the human sciences kind."
"Yeah," he grins. "They are really bad to the core -- but then again, what's a man, anyway?."
"Yes, your Majesty, I'm sure you appreciate the time you take to sit down, properly dressed, every night... with your legs free! You're King. It's a *noble* thing." He flicks the black-and-white Baleful Moodie on the table.
It still feels *like* you failed. All of it. You tried so hard not to fail and now it's impossible not to.
"Can I have the sandwich?"
"I am," he says, stepping closer
Grimace at him for asking, but you can feel it. The näkkies don't like him.
"Let's take a breather." (Conclude.)
"Who's there? What's your name, mister?"
She tries to focus on books and movies, but the lens is blurry and the books seem to float in the air, one by one...
Gone -- like a skipping stone beneath a massive, cold heart.
I wonder what's inside.
It's like something snaps in you, a nerve ending, a thought, a sadness, a longing. Your face in the mirror is suddenly clean of the leer that had distorted it for god knows how long.
It's not a problem that can be solved with logic. Open your eyes and try to live with the voice in your head.
Then your vision blurs. You look to your left, to the sea... It's disappearing. You should say something, anything...
There's no way you're can take care of a bullet in your head. Don't answer the kid questions. This is the end.
"I don't even know what to say... I just feel you. You don't have... rights, Harry." His voice quivers as he stares at you with half-open eyes. "You're big time."
His hand moves to the wallet. "I'm ready to start building *communism* with this, my communists prybar."
He's not feeling too comfortable in his own skin. Odd, I'd say.
Funny as it was, don't think about it too much.
Sure. Whatever keeps you company in this lonely place.
It's probably for the best. 'Tis true -- if the Inventor doesn't want you to. *Probably* this man believed you, on the witness stand.
The pain in your chest tells you it's getting worse every second you're gone, a crimson streak stabbing you as you close your eyes...
I just didn't want to be late.
"I was born on this twenty-two CNY a few months ago. I know the difference between right and wrong. I am here to guard and serve."
Let it fall to the ground, then pick it up.
And your *cockatoo* too?
"It was him. He was spooked and went home. I was hunting him down. I heard the splashing of the waves. I saw him."
He pauses in his writing, clearly in awe of the thought. "Really, Harry, what's this have got to do with anything?"
"I think the young woman who used to work here once told me -- he used to work there a lot. Workplace violence."
She looks left, then right again, her dark brown eyes full of confusion.
You're being had. This is exactly what you were looking for, isn't it? A little *symbolism*!
Long live the *Guns*! These magnificent weapons will defend you against the Prussians and the Vande He might be your dead friend.
"Yeah, he's a dickhead. Tell him." He turns to you. "*You* should be ashamed!"
It would be *clever* of you to overlook the lieutenant's personal opinion, sire. There are risks involved here.
I don't know... not that you feel bad.
On screen, the nightwatchman keeps watch over the couple from behind the Radisson Blu hotel. Suddenly, he steps out.
Keep at it. This thick skull-manipulation will only make it worse.
"No, Kim. It's a stupid, stupid gun."
A true flash of pain streaks through his brow, as he stares at the window.
You're really just scratching the surface here. There are many, many more, if not hundreds of thousands of litres of pure alcohol in there.
"Where would they be
I am going to let it be.
By the way, this is the man who nearly brought down the world with his smoke-filled, booze-fueled rant -- *you* took the blame.
This is the protagonist you've been waiting for. There's really no arguing with that. He's a little too low-key for your tastes...
A radical -- for what?
Beneath the raspberries and honeyed citrus, a salty strip of newspaper.
One day -- decades from now -- a group of anatomically modern men (mostly naked men) are walking along a beach...
There is no potentiation. It is dusk, there is no one there to piss. You have really blown your shit big.
He produces a measuring tape from his pocket. "You've gained about 15 kilograms, or 23 pounds. That's about right. You're now *the hard man*. Come back to it, please."
You caught the man half-awake just now, but he's a sucker for a good time. He's too busy snoozing to appreciate your company's assistance.
"What are you implying?"
An endless variety of microscopic *organisms* live within the human gut. The  entrails of these *animals* are the product of a chemical reaction between animal and plant.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BELIEVE ME. THIS IS A SPIN-OFF. A TICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTICKTIC
"I am, miss. What can I help you with?"
"Hmm, but you've been out here for *two* days, drinking?" He crosses his arms on his ample midsection.
Could that have been a good spot? Could that have been a good sniper position? Keeps you from running into that asshole again.
As you step in closer, you can almost hear the cadaver a heartbeat away. A small figure, seen through the mist...
If you repeat that word many times it will get louder. Maybe you should sing it from memory...
The boy squints, eyes filled with mirth. "I don't even know what that means..."
The legendary Fjördhæmmer is buried under layers of sand and ice. His coffin is  not open to the wind.
"She lives by the water... If you have to ask, I'm afraid you don't have the authority to say." The lieutenant looks out the window, across the water -- toward the shadow-covered roofs hidden beneath the poverty of the Martinaise trash river.
All you need to do is read a case. Make up your own mind about the symbol, what it is and what it's meant to do. This is about case-work, after all.
"A risk we're willing to take, even when we have the means."
Why? There's *nothing* else to do.
No, that can't be it. You have to keep it on the edge, no matter how you did it. Check out Klaasje's room -- you might find something there.
You've been drinking for so long that you're beginning to drink *with pleasure*.
So let's be honest -- this guy's not exactly a genius.
He refuses to discuss the matter further, instead pointing you toward the literature cabinet. It's covered in flyers and maps from across the land.
You sloppily wipe your hands -- palms -- while the mighty gust of the wind drives you toward the sea.
Really? Blink -- you can't even *see* it. You *can* see the bonfire, but you can't *even* see the house.
Bust a move.
Cleansed by the pale, you steady your breathing and stare with new life into the smoker's empty stare -- into his cigarette, trying to get his mind off the stuff.
"Wait, what was this you mentioned?"
"But I said I don't know anything about how Lee has ever held a weapon."
"Please, Mr. Dros. You're making this *harder* for yourself... Just give me one more chance to interview you, Jean."
Performing? Yelling? Maybe it's the time to break out into song? You should do so when the lieutenant isn't here.
You see two branches, one
No. We would never go to these lengths. And we wouldn't do them alone. With your help, we can get to the root of the sin.
"You're not from around here?" She looks at the books in the book store. "She sounds way out of place here."
He smirks. "Let's take it from there. I'm not the least bit surprised you went bankrupt on such a ludicrous proposition."
"I'm gonna take this seriously. This is serious..." She raises her finger. "I can't just let you go like that. You need to be taken to the hospital for a post-mortem examination."
She sighs, then looks to the sea, sighs again, and says, "Do you think it may have been... the Insulindian phasmid?"
"You shouldn't be drinking so much."
"Yeah, that was me, but I wouldn't let you speak with me any more."
"Lizzie De Paule? Or Lely?"
"Oh yeah. Blanc... you should talk to him."
The desk is empty -- you see nothing but chaos on the walls.
The man on the boat seems to be doing something, observing you from the sidelines. Some kind of autonomic device is monitoring your every move.
He says it matter-of-factly and thinks his remarks are mere hypotheticals.
In some strange way this all makes sense: You listen to the tapes, notice patterns emerge, then follow up on those leads -- forming theories, conducting experiments, but none of these can *really* make sense. The case is lost in the noise.
The criminal investigation was a *great* success, he thinks. Thank god it wasn't too dark. Then we would have been in danger.
(No I don't care.) "Oh yeah, sure, *anyone* can smell that too."
A hint of something there -- somewhere in the dark -- just like what you felt when you first laid eyes on the corpse earlier.
He looks back at you with sad eyes. "We won't be there for long, sweetie. Maybe it's better if we just go back to the hallway. Knock
That's an Ister 50. A Zsiemsk-made monstrosity. It's loud in the room, posing a danger to the sleeping scientists.
Not that it has any effect on your overall predicament. As you can see from the list, the *high risk lifestyle* is just that -- a *fact*.
"My condolences."
You know this to be a problem for her, yes.
You had it, you drunk! You had the sass -- when you *arrested* him.
This Phasmid is not an artist. It's not supposed to entertain, it's supposed to destroy.
"You said it was a puzzle."
She nods: "The multiple outcome hypothesis *is* mathematically impossible*, but this doesn't mean we shouldn't *try*."
Once the contract is signed and sealed, what remained was...
You still can't move your head, the bed's too painful to move. You have to remain focused on the horrible mistake you've made.
This is one of those ambiguous, hypothetical things. He hasn't said it literally, but it felt like he was saying it to keep himself from being cynical.
You slam the cutters into the knot. Try to twist the knife so that it comes out cleanly.
"You must be joking. I mean, I've done a thousand adventures through time and space. I don't need the memory-accessories that society has prepared me for."
No problem, I'm out of questions.
By 'primo' he means 'possibly carcinogenic.' Am I sure this is a case involving carcinogens?
"No need to giggle. I'm bored."
Your palm hurts from the flash... but it's okay. The memory is still too nauseating for you
Just one -- not the *missing*?
Look, there's barely anything left to gain here. Just talk to him, win or lose, and everything is okay.
"Oh, I don't know. He's just saying things out of habit. We didn't talk about business often."
"Well, I guess you're not really from around here..."
Look at the bigger item in your hands.
The faceless man looks over his shoulder, to where? To your left, the woman keeps her arms crossed over her chest.
Better not waste time trying to figure it out. You might as well go with the flow, remember?
"Are you sure this is *not* random?"
The old man looks at you as if you're a malfunctioning machine, with a knowing nod and a hard stare.
There are red and white starbursts rising from the darkness. There are some.
Wow, a rare insect! Raising its hand up high, trying to see everything around it. Would you like a hint?
Everything you believe about this place comes from you -- the soft footsteps, the cramped air, humid climate. This is *your* police station, you're in the right here.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. The construction plan is *exactly* what it sounds like.
He's not lying. He was scared.
"Do what you need to do." The lieutenant closes his notebook. "You're a police officer -- do what you need to do."
GOOD. This is good. He doesn't know much about music, but he knows about evrart.
Nothing, but a shadow of guilt. You should have seen it, sire. If you were not *suspicious* you would have seen it!
He frowns. "Of course. If you say it's too late... I don't see how it gets used to its full potential."
Because you and I both. But you get *way* over it. *We'll make it work, will we not?*
Strange little insect. You seem to have it exactly where you left off, with one small glitch -- it's antennae picked it up too. Feels like your heel is about to touch something, just for a second...
Good, I think. I'm the good cop.
This is the outer hull of a boat. While it might seem like a boat to the uninitiated, the more you think about the boat, the less you're sure you're right...
Above the silence, the photo op feels especially nostalgic, like you lost a sibling. Then your heart skipped a beat -- to probe deeper...
While Evrart was busy constructing the trust between Cunoesse and his brother Ferdinand, you have been thoroughly *debriefed* by your *Mind Meld* -- *divided* and *reunited*! By the time you read this you'll have read *four* cases.
There is almost no wind, just the light movement of air through the reeds. Bulrushes swaying on the waterline, long dried leaves chafing against each other.
You don't know where you are, you don't know how you got here, you don't know the history of music, but you should pick up on one thing though: sirens.
That's where you *left off*. Like a hand-held radio transmitter the tiny light helicopter glides over the waves.
"Why is it there?"
"You're right. It seems inconsequential compared to all the other stuff I've done."
A tree sits atop what appears to be a dismantled carabiner. Despite the girth of its branches, the structure appears impossibly small...
A shell, actually. Almost all of it has decomposed into a huge mess. The chitin inside the shell has separated into tiny pebbles that stick out from the reeds.
What is going on? They look like animals, perishing in a day. Your reasoning faculties are no longer there.
They're just literary allusions. Rhetorical devices. The use of the *vows* is an all-too-familiar expression for today's small town cop.
"I'm sorry, Harry. Really. Understood."
You know who I am. I am the Ghost of Sixtieth Street.
He looks at you, frowning. "But we're so used to him here, he doesn't even know us any more. We were friends. Have you seen the news? There's been a change in the lead..."
With the help of a lead programmer from Douglinda -- her address is as far north as I-91 and north of here -- the Revachol Citizen's Group (Citizen's Council) developed a rough script for the communards' rally. It was great work, but it's not *done* yet.
She doesn't seem to be overly distressed, either. It's unlikely she's channelled her energy into anything other than reaching her hand into the flame and looking at it
Where did the church go?
The tall man turns to you. "And you, the private detective, you and I both go on without you knowing. This would be unprofessional."
While the lieutenant himself was fiddling with the various compartments within the vehicle, the BOLI had parked itself just outside the gates...
You think you hear the relaying of some sort of radio transmitter somewhere in the building next to the Whirling.
"If you *want* to try again, fine by me. Just let me know."
This is the Insulindian phasmid. The specimen you found -- once the case was announced -- was large enough to have attracted the attention of a suburban viewer.
I want more.
"See? The surveillance shit
You can confidently say that one is *not* a ghost.
"It's not a good idea to talk about your life with an officer from the RCM."
The great district hums in the slowly falling snow: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls, motor lorries and airships soaring to the south. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to
C'mon. She is trying to get out of a physical injury.
He shrugs. "In general, the ultra-pure breed is associated with certain autoimmune disorders. Insulindian trash-talking dogs are known to bark in the night, and even to bite down on passersby."
If that's true, then *Kim* must be some sort of detective. He looks like Leslie's ex-husband. Or worse -- an ex-cop.
All the while the great district hums in the east, a rusting engine prepares to resume its stirring.
"Why was that?"
Seems like a *necessary* evil.
Serves them right! Don't break your cool to suggest things, this isn't for primo detectives.
She points to you. "You're both so proud of yourself, you don't even want to show it off. Maybe you'll end up shitting yourself..."
The Man from Hjelmdall fights a losing battle against Morgoth, the doom-laden ruler of the Northern Kingdoms. Their bloody battlefield is turned upside down when the doomed king's son, Tyrbald the Bald, saves face by
Suddenly, your entire body is paralysed. Aggressive white noise fills your head -- a strange pain, like you've never felt before.
Exactly. As you've said here, *bratan* -- a pejorative used to describe behaviour deemed unfitting of a police officer. Do you know what it says about the founder of modern Poland? It doesn't even have to be here
It's impossible to say what *the spirit* is. It could be hostile, or friendly. It could be *just* a *corona*!!
What you need to do is dance with the tincture, see what it comes up with. See if it's sugary and dim sum. Then come back to this topic later. Ask about the other kids.
"One of them ate you. It was a moribund alcoholic. He couldn't get the hang of the game."
Noting the smell in this building.
"A civilian, work crew, after the war." He looks out the window. "They have access to the harbour and it's all they need. Plus, the locals tend to flock here when things get tough, you know... and look for all sorts of shit."
You're wrong!
"Thank you for the chance,
You're still good.
The open door leads to a grimy slum of tarpaulin, littered with soggy goods. The road changes direction several times -- to connect with the motorway that separates Martinaise from Jamrock.
There's almost no sensation of the table's material rising up as the lid begins to slide back. All that's left now is to secure it with the tape.
"No idea... could be the noise."
"I do." (Lie.)
====================
No, this is just a fear.
"I'm not sure,
Sola resigned after the Vermillion Spirit took her home. To this day, many residents think she was too trusting, too romantic.
"Who is she?"
There *must* be another way. You feel like there should be. There's no other way... you feel like there's another way. Don't you ever want to give up and look! There's no other way!
"But Kim, I *really* need to go."
"Why would I think of doing that?"
He nods. "It's not my decision to make, and I won't."
The lieutenant scoffs. "You know what you would find in a less paranoid state -- a motor carriage, a motor carriage..."
Isn't it the other way around? Immigrants tend to come from a variety of backgrounds, all of which have something to do with the city
But you don't have to. There are other options -- the makings of a weapon, the spray of a weapon, the cadaver-feathers
"On second thought, I don't want to discuss it any more."
doesn't tell you much about anything.
There's a little pause. Then the woman speaks again: "No, you're too numb to remember now. Go ahead, recall something..."
Isn't it your *fortune*?
As if it's not funny, or
Every cent we bring in is invested back into this community-- so what if there's a 9% catch-up charge?"
The smell of acrid cooked sugar and cigarette butts is uncomfortable. It's also slightly *a*chill.
You're meant to be his eyes and ears.
(Whisper.) "Kim, I need to communicate with you."
Somewhere in Mirova a cat crosses your path. It is morning and there is everything she could ask for...
"Did I ever tell you how many times I've had to do so? I'm not here to recount the adventures of my retinue, brave and *un-fun* as they may be." She smiles brightly. "But my trust is unwarranted, officer. I would only stand in your way if I *needed* to."
In her hands, the pale, somehow still manages to conjure up an almost spiritual connection to the RCTI 3D printer.
He nods. "To an extent. That's what we can do. But the important thing is to find a new leader. Right now he's un-Rehm. That's all I know."
I don't want to think about it any more.
"Forget it, pig. That's nothing."
He smiles. "Not at all."
I don't know why you're the way you are.
You're working with the right hand to unlock this door. The chain looks *ripped* from the hinges. You have to reach across to use the other
"He also hasn't been in there in a while, you know."
A small flare of rage comes over you again -- the stubbornness and unwillingness of some wild beast to let go of this world.
With a gentle nudge the canopy moves, the screen resuming its previous frame. You stand with your hands back in the dark.
The third most common reason for a suspension is assault with a deadly weapon. Tell me about some other awesome stuff that could happen!
"We don't have to worry about this any more. She's not the Raphaël."
This *fan* has a feeling something *bad* is going to happen. How bad you can say is depends on how you choose to respond.
"*Assassin*? Who would even *do* that?"
You've thought it before. You've stood there in the rain, with your hand dripping wet. It has been bleak and lonely.
Oh yeah, that's what this is all about. The art of the card!
The hold you have is about to break... go longer without drinking the potion, and it will wear off.
There's more to the story. Remember how *you* started it? Well, it's got nothing to do with this.
Under the morning sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
Hey, you! You walking around like you're some kind of police officer... You *have* to stay away from these things.
You. You and the seagull are starting to form an opinion on this man -- not the *usual* cop opinion.
Listen, *bratan*, listen!
They haven't even spoken to you yet.
"Or what, bitch? You wanna go to the bar? Go out like you wanna?"
What? I don't know...
Another urban mine, a forgotten treasure on whose ruins a great deal of damage has been wrought.
The younger one opens the canister, spits the contents out and then calmly takes it off to use as a last resort.
She's wearing sturdy worker's boots made of black leather. These out in the open are not likely to yield many options for a weapon of mass destruction.
"A woman is just a woman, you know. What are you going to do?"
As he does, he stomps his foot on the pavement and... BOOM! Instant adrenaline high. Instantly he's right next to the man sitting on the fence, his cigarette fanned out across his chest.
From the corner of your eye, you see a sudden cascade of motion ripple through the sign, twisting around the twisted letters.
It's a metaphor -- for her. For him it was complete madness.
"I... hope you understand, Mr. Kitsuragi. What we were trying to do here was nothing short of heroic."
Close your eyes first.
"Hey Kim, what's with all the *piss*?"
The tuna melt sitting on the smoker's grill looks downright tender.
"You *are* curious. This is the 53rd Police Station in our country. You are the 73rd."
As she makes her way back toward the main building, Evrart's men are standing guard outside her room.
The whole world turned into a bloody mess. You were there. The fire had dried out. You stood there, a desolate wreck.
The hard core skis bounce. The air is made of cheap copy paper, probably leftover from a previous owner. The print is appalling. One of the letters *ROO* has been badly mangled.
"I can't imagine what you're trying to accomplish, detectives, but it's definitely something you should be doing." She looks at you. "If you're not, then I'm very sorry about your math."
From the fumes of motor carriages and lorries driving through the industrial heart of Jamrock -- the city's fortunes seem
"What was he like?"
Your tears still haven't found their way to the claymore... oh god, you can't even imagine the pain of your face without the mask...
Here, behind the 32nd floor of the Whirling-in-Rags, the flooded-out winter wonderland: the Mos Le'Em ski chaleng blockade. On Perikarnassian inspired snow-capped peaks; neon-lit criss-crosses of joy.
The scruffy-haired girl kneels on the floor of the boat, soaking wet. She looks up as he brushes mud off her face.
"Look at me and all the things I've lost."
They're not interested in listening. They don't need your help -- they already have their own money.
Are you going to be *the asshole* and just tell Kim he's wrong? There's dignity in an asshole way. Just be sure to politely decline.
"Let's take a breather before we do anything more serious."
You *feel* it. The smell is like ammonia -- like a slow fire burning on your skin.
This man *liked* the gallows.
Called *The Expression*.
Hey, what are you doing?
The trap has to do -- it can't have a soundtrack. It's not an audio game.
"Uh huh."
"This is ridiculous."
Yeah... fucking kipt.
You still feel uneasy, there's a body in there... some kind of cold... you can't remember where it is.
"We shouldn't waste our time asking him about this. It's pointless. We should *investigate* this, Granger." The lieutenant steps closer, observing the two suspicious individuals.
The lieutenant crouches, looking to the sea. Suddenly, his back is straight. He leans over the rail...
A silvery glove, pressed into marble, looks like a glove, but there's something mysterious about it.
"No, no, he's funny. He's just being funny."
There is *no* anger in his voice. Only the hard core trying to put a price on his head. You can swear you feel the snarl of metal sliding across the rod. Then it's gone.
Your singing voice echoes on the water.
"The hanged man..." (Lie.)
For a moment the old man's gloom has been eclipsed by you. A few stray drops of liquid have started trickling from your nose.
The boy knows his uncle was sent by the Filippian king, who himself is a claimant to the throne.
What *is* this?
There is the tiniest bit of hypocrisy there, isn't he? She's still
"The head of the Union. He's very good. I didn't even want to talk to him -- and I *don't* like talking about myself any more..."
He's denying being party to the death.
The painting?
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, is standing with his shoulders slightly hunched. Another, a young woman, tries her best to ignore the third, a middle-aged man with bloated cheeks, jumping up and down on the sea ice...
"Maybe a different cop was fired for striking a harder-core balance between *performance* and *carelessness*."
What was it like to look into someone else's eyes and hear them for once? You've heard it -- you *have* heard it -- but you don't know where it was coming from...
You're doing a fine job here. Though it does sometimes feel like you're *not* letting the lieutenant know it.
"Because of the weird ass teacher."
"Are you saying it's better that way?"
The problem is compounded by the fact that he's been *leaving* his room -- for at least four days.
He's saying that from head-shake-mode.
You did *not* lose your gun *by accident*. It was definitely a *mistake* -- you should have locked it. You should have kept it. But you just don't have
You've got him. Now play it cool.
In the little cubicle next to the door, on the third floor of the Crimeworks building, the software engineer turns toward Kim, then walks away.
"As you wish." [Leave.]
"This thing is just like the old things -- it's hard core. I can take the *shits* that come with it."
"Take the shotgun," the big guy yells.
Don't leave any loose ends. Think of something reasonable, such as the name of the guy down there...
She doesn't quite have it in you yet. You need to roll with it -- step up and make things your own.
"I don't know... a couple of days maybe? Sometimes I... feel nostalgic for the days when I used to go over there."
The hunter glances over her shoulder. Her light brown eyes move from the table to you, intently tracing the trajectory of the projectile...
Oh god, go ahead. Just so you know -- no talking about *the michael storm*.
That's a very good point. This guy's likely to have some *actions*. You can do something about it, eh?
Yes." The lieutenant makes a note. "It's definitely *not* one of the exhibits we have here. If you're looking for the poor, heart-and-sickness patient in the irregular heartbeat unit please call here -- hour is *maximum* from 17:30 to 21:30."
It's nice and all, but why? The box said "action figure collector". Why not just say you're sorry and go back to your misery?
Piped the ceiling fan.
The red-dyed fuel oil glistens. This was probably one of the vehicles used in the transportation of the protest's materials across theisola.
With a flash of pain he flicks the faucet. "Hey, this one's *all* about the fanciest guy in town..."
"I still need to know how he managed to run all this errand, then go through all those gates and squeeze so many people in there..." He pauses for a moment, looking for the right words. "As if to say that he had always wanted this."
The boy cringes. "I'm sorry, but I really don't have anything else to do here. I guess the story might interest someone."
You see smoke rise from a reduced fuel line. The glow creates an illusory contour to the map.
Trembling under the seditious sway of the sitting post, you try to perform a motion. There isn't one, you're dumb.
"Fine, man, I'm bored, and I don't care about any of your crap anyway. I don't give a shit about *any* of your shit."
But you *got* him *really* hooked on speed. Too bad it didn't work out.
The lieutenant closes his notes, takes a deep breath,
He doesn't look too good in his clothes. An innocent little lifeform, hidden away in a world of freckles and ambrosia.
"You sure you're telling me everything that's going on here?"
With a grimace of pain, and a satisfying pop, the old man draws his last cigar from the pack.
What could go wrong? You're one of the supraculture's most trusted administrators, but sometimes it's easy to gauge a supraculture's *weakness*.
The feat is even sillier than he'd thought.
These are just synapses firing, not neurons. Don't ever ask what *they* are.
Said
"I'm not saying I do, I'm saying we're both working class guys here. I don't need any kind
Of course, *bratan*! If you prefer, you can listen to the wind outside, see how far it's travelled.
Does he know something about that speeding ticket? You have to hand it to him.
"Good. We should leave this place for now and reconnoiter the neighbourhood." He looks at the man with sunglasses and adds: "The kind where you get the lucky little crack. The kind where you can get all the good stuff."
He knows your name.
She looks over the bay, slowly shaking her head.
Also, it's unclimbable.
Flipping through the book you find a number of recipes that appear to be from the same author:
"I'm with the RCM -- what can I say?"
"I think it was Dubois who called you to the balcony, Kim."
"He was," she agrees. "Krenel Commando I knew. But he was also..." She shakes her head, slowly.
A dark brown stain has run down the middle of the table, like so many small drops of blood
We're not off to a good start, you have no idea. This cargo container's sole purpose is to keep the dirt off the cargo containers.
"Damn..." She breathes in slowly, her face still covered in wax, but with some white areas visible.
"Hello." She sounds pleased with you.
He shakes his head in disdain. "I don't really know what you're talking about."
The fishing rod is surprisingly heavy for such a cheap toy. It's probably the reason Ruby's case is so damn puzzling.
A smile plays across his face: "Maybe we should just call it *the Hjelmdallermann murder*. A funny little shopworn lingo."
She's uncomfortable with this conversation, not least of which is the *6'4''''* tower she's been eying for a while.
All you can see is the black-eyed demon in your dreams. All you can see is the black-eyed demon in your nightmares. You can not *waken* him, you can only *haunt* him.
He pauses, looking into your eyes. "Look, you can't be an insect and *not* destroy the damn thing? Did you destroy the damn thing? No. No one believes a cop can love his *best
"And *the citizens*?"
Yes. The number '59 indicates that it's a *street* number -- a numbered street grid that's visible from the Boogie Street overpass.
In all honesty, you should ask her about the tattoo first. To hear what she has to say about the pot!
He nods, casually. "You are quite interesting, I'd imagine."
A look of consternation crosses the man's face: "How can a song written by five people sound any worse than any others?"
And then the sound of glass shattering comes back through the speaker. It's the B rule -- break the belt.
A flash of hatred in the man's eyes.
Correct. While it is true that hyper-kinetic impulses do not usually manifest themselves in physical actions, this does not mean that the boy is not in pain.
After a while, he snaps his fingers under your gaze, then appears to be suppressing a smirk: "Well, the CJ is the only one left... after the CJ vanishes into thin air, all the others are in some cases barely recognisable..."
Since you asked her out she hasn't been back to her room. If she hasn't been back *twice* -- why?
WHAT
There must be about 100 kg of rocks and 200 kg of mud. The mud would cover a city block. The sky is dark and the wind is rough. The name "Isobel Sadie" seems quaint coming from a kid.
"What's... Klaasje doing in a tent on Boogie Street? I thought you said you were out exploring."
A mechanical lever sits in the middle of the floor, like a carabiner -- the long neck draws a narrow path under the ceiling. Underneath, you notice a relay box, loosely closed.
But you can't believe you did... it's impossible. All you see is an old man with huge, unwashed, unkempt hair.
Sounds like you've misquoted Evrart -- think hard about it...
"I would not be so sure."
Of course. Better to tell him than to leave you hanging like that.
It's like a cadaverous spasm emanating from the dead man. A great tempest is brewing inside of him, yet it is not your purpose here to know.
She said it was cold. That's all.
"You're not sorry -- you're ashamed."
I'm sure it's a *boreal* creature. Not like the stuffy, high-maintenance central nervous system of superintelligent animals.
The waterline to the left of the croissants and juice bottles is shaved off, leaving a depressent feeling when you crane your head. Beside the sandwiches, you find a bottle of amphetamine liquor, and a small wooden token that's quite... worthless.
The blue heart rules.
That was a lie. Of course you lied. Go into the closet, push her around.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. It's signed by Idiot Doom Spiral and someone called Tom took the slip and they folded it into two pieces...
The one you're looking for *and* everything is... there is... something in the way she says *now*? You have to be careful.
He doesn't *want* to see her, you know -- he *needs* to investigate the crime before he investigates this lady
The man gives you a long, slow shake of his head. "You should probably look at her and discuss it with her, since she *still* had her phone on her ear."
Are you trying to be clever? You're like a kid who tries to pretend he doesn't know what his father's going to say. It's a stupid line of questioning, and he doesn't want you to remember it.
"Hey, I haven't really done anything yet."
"No, you're right. It's a symbol. You need to get rid of it."
(Kick him in the balls.)
[Put the book away.]
The meat is surprisingly tender. It's almost chewy at first, but then it starts getting mushier...
What it is you've never figured out,  you dumbfound out, is that there is no such thing as a *serious* opinion.
God dammit, you're twenty something, a regular working man, not a stripper or a heroin addict...
As you step into the massive central furnace room the first thing you notice is the queue of bed-sick employees of the lesser Industrial Harbour towns. For several days the poor wretch has died of lyme disease in the city morgue's hands...
"You're not giving me a single, single thing. I can't even afford the dress you're offering me."
"Tuc-kill chit-chat, baby," he exclaims with excessive glee.
"Are you saying that it's impossible to save a wallow that long?"
Suddenly you're reminded of...
This heavy wrought
...does not answer.
The lieutenant examines the dead man's torso. "I've seen worse. This isn't the worst I've seen, but it's not *pretty* either..."
"It's a study hall, officer, for criminals. It's half-full of last-century workers from the year '41."
He takes off his glasses and wipes the snow off his face. "No one tells Cuno what to call something. That's not how we do business here."
It's getting late... time to head to sleep. Best not stay outside on the wind-stricken coast.
A pitiful lump of flesh is trying to keep your head above watery mess. How can you keep it afloat with your mouth?
In her hand she has no book to read, no one to tell. The library card is hanging by a thread --
"No-no. That's uncalled for."
A light green flare-up ensnares your vision -- then it disappears. The newspaper remains perfectly still in the flame...
"No, she's
What you're describing is a minority theory based on the antiquated observation that all humans are  sharecroons in her lorry.
It's meant to entertain.
Your knowledge of the subject doesn't allow you to fake a smile.
Why do you ask?
"There's no shame in speaking your mind."
The chips are still smouldering in his hand, there's a trickle of oil now. He doesn't seem to be moving much.
I would argue that it's not quite that simple. A number of factors come into play, but the most important is the lieutenant's admirable resolve.
"I told you not to say that..."
"I'm gonna shoot a kid. The rest will fall in my hands." (Point at the bottle.)
Your hands are protected from the scorching heat by your vest and your jacket. But your fingers are getting red from the intense heat...
You hear some light footsteps and what appears to be a daily weather forecast playing on the radio.
You're right. Don't just go straight for the jugular. There's something 'hot' about this one.
"Yes, Harry. I understand." He turns to you. "Now -- I know you're not *happy* about this, but the club was paying you, so you have to."
She mentally counts the distance between here and the village: over the course of ten minutes she would have been able to pinpoint the exact spot in the dilapidated old church.
I know there's a reason *not* has been used to this effect so many times.
"I got it. Now let's go." [Leave.]
A perfect storm is brewing.
The kid turns away from you, grimacing. "I guess I can't comment on the matter any further..."
Yes. There is. No point in denying it. You *went on* too long. You need to stop thinking about it.
"What now?" she says, turning to you. "You're a cop, Harry, you don't *get* to talk about *anything*."
The dollar signs.
With a jerk of his head the youth runs over the balustrade and disappears down the opposite bank.
This one's bad. Trust the women in their cells. They're *in* there.
"Hell, if I knew, I would have painted that Kilos (the kiptic type) blue."
All sorts of *crazy* things happen when *two drunk sailors side-by-side* for an extended period of time.
Somewhere in the course of preparing to take on this case, Klaasje has created a mental map of the RCM's operations. The map features: *The Col*, *The Stalemate* and *The Insulindian phasmid
Didn't she just sound aloof? That's what her friends would say about you.
She *does* seem frail, gaunt in her lanky frame. All those years of malnutrition have aged her into a surprising youth.
Even the wind stops. There is no wind at all this evening.
This is clearly marked down as a Thriller. Try to hold on to it, if you can.
You pulled the lever up really, really hard.
Could this be the Inland Empire State? The scent of sweet crude that seems to have been carried across the ocean somehow?
followed by the text.
"I'm gonna pull your head off, Titus. Take the main story line, open the gates and *blaasma pistol* him..."
"You are right, the door was just for decoration. That's all I know."
The book is *unusually* heavy in your hands. It takes some effort to keep the whole stack in...
"No, it was... Kim. It was me."
Just pointing out the stupid things people say when they don't have to justify their existence.
And above them all -- the night sky above Jamrock Quarter -- the sprawl of the Amnesia.
An opaque mouth is agape. His scowl is too thick to be drawn out. His gaze shifts to the man staring back at him.
"Stop! I want to talk to you about *sex*, now!"
The lieutenant doesn't say anything either, but he makes a slight "Oh..." motion with his head.
"What about *I*, officer?"
The uniform clad man seems to enjoy the strange sensation. He just wants to keep moving.
"Of the colours?"
"I'm not taking the case. If you're not ready, we can always change our minds."
It was the lead programmer's responsibility to oversee weekly maintenance of the off-site copy and, well, keep the lights on -- a terrifying responsibility.
No, that's not *quite* right. It's a good idea to step away from the moment you think about it now and reapply if you get the chance.
It would certainly fit the cultural landscape of the ages.
Your words echo in the Kvalsund cafeteria. Students, teachers, co-workers: Klaasje, Hjelmdall; Ulf Andersson, Hjelmdall...
Didn't think this through, man.
So you make out a few notes. Not that you'll be taking them all home. You're sure as hell not going to, it's stupid.
Yes. It's about moving mountains. This case is not about her at all. It's about *you* -- the one with the green shirt, the muscle car, and the *bicep beard*.
"Yes, that's the basic premise of the story. But..."
He seems confused. Perhaps a little annoyed...
There's a slight mischievous streak to him, like he's plotting something. This could be useful in your case against Evrart.
With a sudden flash the world freezes over. In a vast office building cafeteria the man on the cafeteria wall smiles at you...
"And they've all been tortured, Kim. In the name of 'progress'. Yes they are."
One bullet should do the trick. You have it in your hands -- no need to look away now.
"What are you talking about?"
Does this mean I'm a cargo cultist?
Whip 'em out!
Someone's not quite sure what this *is* -- is it a little *strange*, or is it... the Afterlife?
I am prepared.
It's too late
On the islet? There's no air-space between the skin and the bones -- there's nothing between the thin concrete slab of the islet and the  high voltage power line.
The water lock! The water lock! The *lock* was a selling point! This item was added to the bargain because it was so... unaffordable.
Feeling woozy? An empty stomach and a bad hangover aren't going to make it any less of a miracle.
He looks around -- at the slow, calculated approach of a fleet. Wind blows in from the coast, slowly, deliberately channelling the voices into a ceaseless turgid rattle.
Oh yes, you've been there -- just take it easy for now.
Surely this is not the phasmid that hit the cobblestone street light. It's much more like a piece of art.
Perhaps it's your mind, or your destiny, but you are about to experience the *best* party ever.
He grins. "I can't say that. But I think he got the point. Don't worry, we'll take care of you guys too. Like we always do."
The call comes to you like the organ playing a hollow melody. A great organ! No one can hear it now, but you suppose the song is kind of a bonus.
When she got the call, she was still on the phone with Evrart, the manila folder held at his side. The small file cabinet under the monitor displays paperwork from their conversation.
Morell believes the fallen tracker is responsible for bringing the piratical activity to the coast.
She means -- very probably -- that Ruby was in on the act. Also, suspicious mushrooms cover her hair. That said, she would be *hard-core*.
nay, this is but a drop in the bucket compared to the ocean of black carbon dioxide already gushing forth from the Union's command structure...
That *gift* you're giving up, to hang out with Garte? A grand expanse of water that's not for swimming. Don't give up on her, man.
"Okay. We still need to perform a field autopsy on the victim, but..." He glances toward the exit. "It's more likely we have an *extensive* anal probe conducted by your station."
Of course. Between you and me, your name is probably Harry.
There's no way around this, he's stuck as it is. If you don't get it right away you'll never be able to get it out of your lungs.
The large man pats you on the back. "Believe it, cop boy! We saw it was a *colossal* mistake to let Miss Page-Three work with Grease. Turns out he's *crazy*. Guess we better let her go then."
"Told you.
To his left, the second lieutenant, on whose shoulders you can see a slight glimmer, raises his right arm in the air.
I want to move, man. First you move, then you *get* over it.
What about the lighthouse in the afternoon light?
He sighs, then looks at you with a sudden pain in his voice. "I really do hope we solve this case, officer."
Silence. The lieutenant takes his glasses off and does the same. You've made your peace.
"It's really only your idea."
The effort is completely gone. The task is no longer on your shoulders -- it's already done. You are ready to concentrate on the facts.
She was rather suspicious about you and your motives, now that you know more about them.
Where?
"Totally a coincidence. Looks like some local junkie or some shit. Those guys like to down code by the truckload."
He nods. "You're soon going to see that bottle more like the rest of them. Until then, though..."
But I don't want to argue with him.
Look at the pile of toilet paper.
"Fuck no! Look at this shit... What
He nods. "A common Hermit, in the wild reeds. Younger, I would judge. More common hooligans in a dark tower."
"No, detective -- I meant who lives here." She nods towards the yard. "The Waltons. The biggest firm in town."
"It's true. I have a medical problem and it's not getting better."
Your vision clears and you're plunged back into the maze of empty bottle *cans* on the ground.
It looks downright *crazy*. Truly remarkable -- this cargo hauling machine has *no* desire to *
"Not really. It was about him humiliating you." He looks at you. "And now it's all over."
"The Leader's character is such that he would go to any length for the betterment of the *Union*. This leads me to believe that the Union is taking care of *everything* within his power to keep him."
There's still more to know. Just
Here we go. Zoom in on the upper lip of the man's hat
You try to move your hands, but no movement. You're frozen.
On the raft you see two terrifying snow-flakes melting onto the waterline, some as far as two storeys away...
Don't laugh.
The air gets cold as ice. Somewhere in the distance a group of hymn-singing ibis come to a standstill. There's a palpable sadness in that voice.
Stop!
Damn, soody, that medicine cabinet is where you *pawn* off your stash. Seal of approval here.
"The boiadeiro's markers, his armour, and even his lorries." He reaches into his gun belt and gingerly takes out the clip for a moment. "I have plenty to choose from now. Personally, I prefer the Royal Innossence Mounter."
The man himself is not doing too badly. His head is rock solid, and he's not moving much.
The Duns Gráda, the *Devil's Advocate* ski patrol. The pilot Flying Monsoon, Mike, and...
Whoa, how does she know your name? She hasn't heard it! Don't give up, try again later, if you don't come up with a killer idea...
There's a little flip side to this coin. You see a slick newspaper ad mounted on the wall. It reads: "Tired of the dull colours of life? Look no further -- indulge in the vividness of the Life Line!"
"Well, some dumbass in the alley. A drunk and a hooker. That's why it's me. I'm Police-Dog."
It looks like a spiky plant, with bristles sticking out from under its compact insect-like cellophane membrane. A plant, you mean?
"I've got you cornered,  copman! Keep it to yourself, keep it to traffic." He gives you a wry smile. "Let me know
While Evrart draws a line on the ground, the lieutenant contemplates the situation. Seems like a bad idea -- to interfere with the image he's trying to project.
A large, loud woman *knows* the fire pit in La Delta; another near the La Delta market a policeman interrupts a mad dash for glory...
He wouldn't normally have reason to be suspicious, but he is now. Somewhere -- under the seagull ...
Don't drop it. Let the fucker go.
"Okay. It's been a long week."
"Oh." She looks at you worriedly. "I don't really know why I said that. All I know is..."
*Paranoid rage*. People who know him fear this stage and look for ways to make it more difficult.
Behind the despair -- a tower, cast in ice.
Just tell them you're not Dirk Pavers, and that you're not Wilkins either. That's it. Nothing more to do here.
"I'm looking for some company to build a little *gadwall*, I can help you."
You see a battered mannequin head on an egg shell. The face wears soot over the shoulder of a cigarette -- a final, long text has been scribbled beneath an over-arching drawing.
His friend grabs the gun and holsters in his direction. "Don't worry, man, we'll make him talk."
What is... life after *death*?
The new recruits are extremely enthusiastic about the idea of the bullet hole in his brain.
"What happened? Did you?"
As you hold it closer, the phasmid feels it's chest filling with a stench of metal and flesh. Its giant arms let out a noise...
"Okay. Why are you calling me '
"Let's go then, lieutenant," he says and turns to you. "I'm sure we have more important matters to attend to, Harry."
"Thanks for letting me know, mate. It's always nice to know I can still rely on you..." He sighs. "Will do."
You smile politely -- but then you remember something -- a forgotten gun. Please, someone watch over Ruby!
Weird... how? You feel your collar move, as though someone tapped you on the shoulder. You look up and the air gets cold. Then the heat ends
It didn't have to be. You're still here, resisting... but you *can* do it. You've really got him now.
You missed your chance to learn more about her true feelings by not completing the case against Ruby.
*It* was a lie. There was never a *party* on that roof. There was never even a *party fatality* in that *room*. Never.
No, it wasn't.
"How did we meet?"
What did she just call you? A ball? A trampoline? Don't call him a nab, that's not *good* enough. Be more forceful.
The first rung of the ladder leads to a pair of boots that appear in a crack in the wall. In addition, there is a toolbox in the upper left corner of the shelf...
"Right. I've put the tape player away. You should have it." (Leave the tape player unattended.)
That's it. The plaque still smells of urine.
"Yes. The end is nigh."
A thump! Bam! The air full of high-pressure air -- into your little chest.
The archipelago of Suresne is one of the most sought after treks in the Occident. The highest peaks are fetching thousands of dollars in rocks and gems.
"We have every right to be suspicious of anyone who looks like they might be on the fence. But there's nothing to worry about."
The man before you nods. "Looks like the phasmid has been feeding on his blood for quite a while."
What you've done is shatter a window in half, allowing the wind to get under the ice and the cold air to freeze the records.
She smiled at him. A crooked little smile, made worse by the cigarette lingering on her lips.
The tape-like object is spinning up again, like an ancient record player. Not a sound is playing.
He nods toward the stairwell. "This may be the wrong place... But you always do the *right* thing and try to help the little guy out..."
Filling them up, *bratan*! Even Cuno fainted from lack of magnesium in his blood -- see! He's still here!
"The End Is Nigh!"
That mouth... it's freezing, the makings of disgust. But what could it come up with? There's no one to tell it, apparently.
Across the harbour, on the banks of the river Esperance
You should still pursue this idea, though. Theres a hidden layer of the skin that just doesn't leave you roses any more.
Don't you trust me? You gotta trust me on this. Go ahead and ask. Whatever you have to do, detective.
On the one hand, it's incredibly charming. On the other -- you're a police officer, not a folk hero.
And still does. So, anyway. Space ship's gonna be fucking huge. You'll be able to keep it in the air for a while."
I like this kind of pressure better. Sometimes you have to be strong enough to grab the case out of the air.
A stray cat isn't the be all and end all of modern life, but it *is* something to cherish. You should return to it often.
He nods toward the garbage container. "You can take it. Just crank it up a notch -- this is a plastic container, don't worry."
Is he truly aggravated about it being a cop's *pants*? He could go on in like that for days. Until you get *under his* skin...
Fried some anchovies.
Your hand reaches deep into darkness, almost drowning in sadness. You find the remote...
Are you done?
The hard core is a four way joystick, a middle ground between the hardcore bro and the deathless simulation.
He does not want to dwell on the past. Not all of it. There are important parts of the past that need to be present.
"Maybe I was, but I've *never* been to a protest."
He points to Kim. "And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois." He waits for the lieutenant to respond.
Waves wash the sand... a blur of motion cuts into the water -- before it recedes into the depths of the ocean...
The feeling deepens. The dampness is nauseating.
"You could take it easy. You're feeling a little *nervy* today, aren't you?" She's unimpressed. "What happened?"
Lieutenant Kitsuragi takes a step back from the window. "Perhaps a little… I mean, it's not like they're going to put it in their heads."
Haven't we all, Harry?
See, the key here is a non-commercial substance. You could've done something *more* valuable for it. But you decided to just stick
"They work for someone. Or *somebody*. If you tell the company they're going out of business -- they'll just write a new drawing for you, like you're the only one who's done it..."
As you make your way to the fourth and final row: *The Insulindian Chewing Gum wrapper*, *The Book of Slim Jim*, *The Pathologized Man* and the *Finally Calm* poster.
For that matter, your memories have *not* been solid enough for a DNA test. At this point, it's just a *wild guess*.
The Wild Pines Group is one of the original Revacholian *indotribes* -- companies awarded royal monopolies by the king (the suzerain) himself, centuries ago. The king is long gone,
The plaque is *annual*, it's missing information. There's a note of schism in the entry. Three decades after ...
This whole interaction has given him the *confidence* to speak up -- but *he's* not prone to tip-toeing around sensitive subjects.
"Cool. It's *desirable*," the lieutenant nods approvingly.
There is no warmth anywhere in her lukewarm belly. The great hallways are empty; no one is home at night.
There is *NO* light on the third floor of the Whirling-in-Rags. You hear the distant mur
"For God's sake..." She's left her mind by the fifth reál.
He doesn't look convinced of that statement.
[Put the stickers away.]
The design is terrible, but it fits the case. The lighting designer probably named it after him too.
Gone in a puff of wonder. It's almost like *yourself* has gone! Remember: No one likes you, you only have self-awareness.
"Exactly. I haven't *done* anything."
A coil springs into being when water molecules interact. A megawatt turbine, a junction box, a piece of paper by the water lock...
Do you realize what you just said?
Your incendiary comment has failed to stir a reaction in the moss-covered man.
Not surprised.
"Yes. When the inter-isolary competition is so *low* on empirical
"All right. Sorry to interrupt your smiling, but I have something else to tell you about our client."
"Do it...?"
"Oh, okay. It was me. My name's Meg Ryan. I'm a reporter for the Daily Planet. You can go to..."
"Alright, we've looked around, this is pretty big," he says, turning to you. "But we still need to talk about the shop."
"So aiight, honey!"
I smell an actual corpse.
"Oh, it's you." The cheery boy nods at you.
"And then came the murmurings of the Innocents. In the ice bear den, in the reeds... People say the Curse has already taken its toll, but do I really know? It's not an... innocence, it's a... fancy word."
"No-no." The man suddenly feels confident. "It's called musical theatre and you know how you can get stage-time? *Free* theatre. There's no cost."
"...this." (Pull up your fly.) "This is the red portal in the boardroom. That one leads to your room."
"Huh... maybe not. I don't *really* know anything about that."
The speaker comes to life, its tiny hand-held mic shining in the candle's way. "Can you hear me now?"
He steps back and looks around in the tent. "I've seen worse. This was probably more like the first floor of the Whirling-in-Rags."
A great excitement is bubbling to the surface within him. This man, this young man, has *passed* the test.
He thinks it was more like *that one time*. He's heard that before.
"What was the name of the game here?"
What do you think you're doing right now? Taking the coldest shower you've ever taken? You'll never look back.
He lifts his head and looks at the door with blinds. "I don't even know what I'm looking at..."
"You, Eugene, are a pleasure dame, mate. I don't care about your *hoes*, I care about my trade secret."
The way he says that, without looking up from his note, makes it almost impossible for you to misconstrue his meaning.
"Truly, it's impossible to underestimate the commitment and tenacity of this small but vocal minority..." He looks to the president. "...when faced with an insurmountable adversary. The PR nightmare can't be... worse than... ever."
You should have a look into that hat there. It may give you an opening.
This means he doesn't care about stopping you from killing him. If anything, he seems to be saying *thank you* instead.
This is a minor point. Don't worry too much about this. Let him off the line and do the talking.
The lieutenant turns to you: "The *näkki* is a type of shaman -- by the way
"So you're not worried about me?"
"Yeah, a walk along the coast
Look, there's free money on the table. You should press *Play* on it. Maybe it will yield something...
Who said anything about setting it free? No need to back out now. You've stood there for too long.
It feels cold. Like the touch of a freezer that's about to open.
It comes to you like a blue whale. All the strain and strain are melting away. You're like a fish out of water -- the complications of the crazy sky-high-concept bender behind you.
"So much for the legendary kipt."
What? Is she serious? You just talked about how nice it felt to punch some evil-doers. Maybe it's something for *you* to *fix*?
Beneath the alarm clock is a gentle whimper. Some seagulls have been huffing its sweet nectar lately -- it's a sad story.
The hand-off. The motor lorries at the roundabout. She looks at the pictures of past presidents on her wall, then back at the note, smiling.
"I didn't know a person who's a super-cop. That's why I can't give her a call back, thank god."
So who blew the whistle?
"I just think it's like everything. Unimportant, silly. But I'll be damned if I're the only one
"Why *did* you put up with him?"
Outside, a cold wind moves through the reeds. The white-on-blue police livery of the motor carriage blinks slowly around you.
"You could hide from me, I've been doing some *interesting* things lately."
"I thought you meant it to be funny."
You pick up on something his hand is doing in the air.
Soon. The law requires you to set up a workable reconstruction of the old government headquarters, in the apocalyptic vision of the future.
"Aye, so here you are. It's late and the heat is on. I know this place -- I'm a huge Kandyan fan."
"What about the guardsmen?"
This is Precint 41 -- north of here -- and in the vicinity of here. It's probably nothing, unless you count the few *holes* there are in the line.
All you hear is silence.
Oh yeah... *ruins* -- and all of them. It's *ruining* the town. The painting is *on* the wall.
You think the words hold weight?
"And those... tactics seem fairly sophisticated, Miss. It may be that our young lady have trained you..."
It's much easier to describe the propulsive helium balloon in two words than it is to actually fly one.
It appears to be a matter of some provincial jurisdiction. Whether it's a *pogrom* or a *riot* it's a sad day in a sad part of town.
There's not much to do once you open the front door. The posters are everywhere: gynecological, pediatric -- even emergency room photos of people with nowhere else to go.
Seems like this was written during the Cuno's youth. Cuno was the *wild one* -- in his teens, when he was already a programmer.
"Oh yes, I'm all out of time." He fiddles with the man's hair. "This case is all about time. You're *in* it now -- he's *died*."
They appear to be normal high school geometry, but what *conclusively* you have is too dark to make out. There is a well-traveled way back, though -- by land, air, and sea.
It's unspoken, but a whisper goes: "You'll be back in two years, Jack, and she'll be waiting for you..."
He shrugs. "I don't even smoke myself. Why bother, when you can just have a ciggy after?"
In all likelihood, it was a good idea to go along with this. The kid knows *something* about the phasmid.
There's a pang of guilt: you should've counted the cards, but you just don't have that kind of brainpower... And neither do they.
"Whatever, I'm not giving you any info anyway..."
"Right, you're on!" The lieutenant takes the autograph. "Five for you."
Look at it, detective. All of it. All of your messes. All of your *dispositions*. The black shoes, the greasy dishwater...
He looks at you coldly, then at the scribbling on his notes. "Enough of this pathetic mess. Let's talk about something else."
As you hold it in your hand you begin to suspect the object's possible 'backstory'. A *tribunal* might be in the works...
You should have a drink right now.
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was an economist and a theoretical historian. He was a leading figure in the Graad side of the Turn of the Century Revolution, where he headed the Nine Day Government. Maz
You pushed him, but you didn't break his fall. Push him more, *bratan* him... and *if* he resists, knees buck under you.
The clerk doesn't give a damn about your gun, or the morals of mankind. The rage in her eyes is spiteful.
Let's *look* at it another way. You and him are in a compromising situation. You should know the ropes. Grab a knife and a gun from the Kineema. You can't shoot while you're listening.
Who'd have thought you'd remember that song, 'She Loves You' by Deora, though?
Building the *perfect* union. *Even* on the seas. This ain't no fluke.
Maybe it's a good idea to call it out on the spot? You don't have to like the things you say, but you do have to *dislike* them.
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was an economist and a theoretical historian. He was a leading figure on the Graad side of the Turn-of-the-Century Revolution, where he headed the Nine Day Government. Mazov is considered the father of scientific communism (mazovian thought or mazovianism).
You feel like it was a good idea to peek inside. To see what's inside...
"A man with that position has all kinds of cash on hand. It's not like that in the *real* world, though. It's real jacked shit. Like a fiver or two on the go. Something for free."
"This is clearly what the phasmid looks like." (Point to the statue.)
"The insurgency's over. You're all just mercenaries."
Every time you think you've found a way to the roof, the stairwell, the helipad or the engine room -- you're wrong. Now it's just a pile of sticks. Nothing to see here, right?
"Of course, it's not my name, it's the Insulindian Repeater Station's name. But if it's me,
You hear the distant rumble of the city. It feels icy and odd.
The animal is uninterested in your peculiar mechanical phenomenon. It's probably more like an expression. Do anything for the investigation, detective?
It's like something snaps in you -- your muscles and your mind release a final push, a crescendo of music, like you've never heard before.
The man has his eyes on Kim.
The demon with sunglasses and a smoke inhalator has impaled himself on your hand. His corpse is bloated and decomposing, a torment in hell.
"You don't need to thank me. I'm an officer of the RCM -- I get it. I get it all."
"I feel strange. Old and alone."
It's clear the organised crime figure whoohoos at the house, expecting him to be the scapegoat.
Yes! You have absolutely no idea what *gun powder* is -- it's probably some weird drug the lieutenant mentioned. You'll have to keep that shit to yourself for now, try and collect your thoughts.
The tools of the workers were antiquated and difficult to use, but indispensable nonetheless.
The chill washes over you as you stand in the pale morning light, amidst the reeds. The reeds whisper their silent aid.
"It's a question that doesn't have a good answer."
"Okay. I'll think about it."
"I have a very small lead on this one, but I'm willing to go along. So, detective, how can I help?"
She looks like one of those exotic flowers that only flowers last *a* or *e* year, not *citizen journalist*.
That's clever. They'll be hard pressed to name all of them, but you think the skiff's all hers?
"'Come to think of it, maybe we can put a book in the laundry room.' He says it to mock you. If you don't know the First and Third Lessons, the Königstein cowgirl doesn't have to know them either."
You were. And you're still. Coming off like that is torture. And you should *not* do it.
That doesn't sound right.
With a violent gust of wind the scissors cut into his hair. The scissors have to be turned again, because the toupee's about to explode.
He puts his glasses back on. "I was thinking maybe I could show you around Martinaise, see what it's like. Radio Technology."
Thank you, dark center, for pointing out the goddamn poster.
It's like he's *not* afraid of death.
"Yeah. So one of the things we got from the library was this dildo. The RCM has it in a transport container."
You should go on stage and try to catch the man's eye, but you know a thing or few about being underprepared.
"Who am I then? All I do is think."
"I won't know, not *anymore*. I've come so far. I'm the one who made you my prisoner."
Oh yeah! Straight into the junk. A gold-toothed gryffin throwing poetically shaped blocks at someone -- he throws them *funny* like that. Don't laugh, it will only make you look bad.
"Yeah! Yeah!" She breathes on the fingers she's using to steady her breath. "You gonna make this up to cover your ass up, piggo? Cuno knows the Cuno has some serious demons inside."
You hear that, house?
They're alien anyway.
"I'm not really feeling it, if that's what you mean."
"Yes, but the Land is most definitely a vast and inscrutable expanse of water. It is a vast, mysterious place, and no one really knows what it's doing here. It is a strange thing -- a place without an identity. What do you know about the World?"
"Do you know who he was?"
Is it? It *is* strange that you would say that while everyone is staring at you with beady eyes...
Wait! What if it's not just one or the other -- but both of them? You've got to find that *something*.
"You don't have to worry about *anything*. I'm a cop -- and I'm not worried. Everything is connected."
A memory surfaces in you -- a vivid one, a snowstorm late one night. On Rue de Saint-Ghislaine a/k/a *Saint-Gene* there is a dead body in the square coated with the night's scent. Even in the late hours of that horrible night.
"Seems like a lost cause."
"Because they're black."
She tries to seem oblivious to her surroundings. You might be able to ask her about the run-around later...
The woman here is silent, enthralled by the thoughts on her mind. She doesn't know what she's talking about.
What an interesting little world.
"Interesting." The lieutenant coughs.
"But why should I help you?"
"It's black and white on the inside. In fact, I think it could actually be darker than that. But it's meant to look that way. There's a black key on the door, behind which you'll find a fuel cap. It'll take you right back
You missed an ok rock here, but the tape speaks for itself.
"Yeah, I like those." She looks at the stacks, looking for the maps and books that haven't arrived yet. "He's got it."
As he stares you down, the man trembles
That is a strange way to begin. (Stop the flashback.)
Nod along -- it's your kind of cop.
You *get* me Cobo. I feel like you were once for tenderness, but something told you to stick with the passionate -- and this was you doing it.
No, your heart and your soul are first together. Together you are the Ultimate Team. Each and every one of you.
"Told you!" He rolls his eyes. "Let's get back to reality. There's really no point in keeping this up."
An endless variety of Hjelmdallermann quotes frame the loop. When the time comes, so do the hammer and nail.
"Just a moment, ma'am."
"Sure, man. You don't have to explain yourself." The man nods, then looks to you. "So -- *what* did you say?"
There's something moving in the dark corners
"We should ask her what she's doing in Martinaise."
Probably for the best -- don't continue this *investigation* any further. There's *nothing* more to do.
A machine with a wooden heart sits in the corner, being used for cold storage. It has a rectangular heart-shaped coffee cup in its heart.
She seems reluctant to even consider the idea, but she'll hold her ground. Don't worry.
He sighs, looking down. "So... all good. Let's go have a drink then, I'll be damned. The Martinaise in the East..."
"I haven't really asked you about the moon landing."
"Have you done any *crimes* lately?"
Stop, just for a second. Look at her lean -- on you, her back, against the wall of pain. Yes, you see it -- *that's* it. The *hard core* in you is on her. Married to her. Wearing the *leader* hat.
I understand. (Gesture toward the
You see the sleek black box, like a puzzle piece of plastic. Printed on the side, inside it's barely visible. Below it all -- a shelf with a sticker -- next to it.
"You mean the scratch you got from the dead guy? That
"I'm sure I can come up with a way to help her out."
"No, I meant the way he acts."
Also of note -- your name does not *exists*. It's just something that people in Martinaise called you.
"Did you make your *point*?"
could be what the market needs... is it not enough to live in your parent's basement?"
She's not used to getting personal advice from a member of the law firm. Perhaps you shouldn't push her too hard on the information.
That would be strange, don't you think?
"Yeah, I said I wasn't into them at all."
He nods. "Make it, make it right."
What is it with these SKULLS? Do they have any ID on you? There's definitely something going on here... maybe he's
Your secret is safe with the dead man's DNA, freezing. Not the lieutenant's, which is on ice.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. It's signed by Idiot Doom Spiral and someone called Klaasje apparently.
No. Stop. You're too *deep* in the head to see this through to the end. The pithy title of the book *Perikarnassianism--The Golden Notebook* is just an allegory. It *does* mean something, but what it *means* is pure conjecture.
He shrugs. "With all the shit that's been thrown at us over the years, maybe we shouldn't be so skeptical."
The bloody knife is holding fast to your right hand, dripping with gore... the man takes a step back.
The fist made the call.
"And when the bones are weighed, the weight is divided among the parties concerned. The parties that need to be supported most... those who are supposed to be supporting, in this instance -- the Union."
The author is hesitant to open up about the show business, but there's a *knows he's a drunk*.
"I don't care what you think. There is no
Give up. There is no other way. You're spinning tapes. The room fills with a chemical smell of burning rubber.
The *Amato Columbiana* motorway. The *Black 10° turn-of-the-century superhighway* that spanned the Insulindian isola. It connected the city of Revachol with
She looks like a pre-dawn raid. Something bad has happened.
We'll be both *crazy* and *victorious* if we let it stand like this. This is a vital case. PLAY IT SAFE.
You're in, baby. The gate is open. Come ride with me.
The old man does not say a word, eyes filled with sleep. When he wakes, it's already morning. He stands outside in the midday sun, a huge slab of concrete rising from the sand -- half-submerged.
He looks confused but proud he came up with that retort, but the man himself is not one to kid around.
This is where the crazy one comes in. He says the most *impressive* thing. Don't let him work alone!
"I have *no idea* how he came to that door."
There is some mangled tape in the audio side of the mix, mostly recorded at that exact moment in time. It's a spinoff of the events of the previous record company, which was seized upon by the Coalition's Economic Geography Department.
She sighs, looking at you expectantly. "You can't trust your own eyes. Are you sure you're clear enough?"
"Yeah, I'm right where I want to be."
Don't be an idiot and say you're sorry! Maybe it was just nervousness? Or maybe you were thinking of *it's a duo*?
Of course you do. What's this all about anyway? Who cares if you're jacked up? This is where you belong.
You do. The deputy chief, who's also a beer gorging big dick, sees your gleeful little grin and smiles back at you. You had me at *The Expression*.
"He's truly good at this."
"I'm very glad that you're well. I was worried that you might not want to see me, but I'm glad I was able to convey the fact that you are, in a way. I can't say about the others..."
Patrol Officer Judit Minot stands in the corner, behind which a snake charmer stares at her. The call box is still buzzing, but it's hard to hear her conversation.
Oh my god! You're feeling sick. You've been poisoned, bro.
He throws you a look of weary patience. "Whatever is necessary, I guess. Now let's go. *Finish* this interrogation, Harry-boy."
His right hand grabs the barrel and a bullet hole appears close to the muzzle.
God damn it!
does not exactly have the read/write power of *Perseverance* or *Revachol*.
Looking past the dead man's empty tomb, you see the man himself, standing at a corral of packing peanuts. The scent of apricots mingles with that of apricots and figs.
"I'm sorry. Was there something else? It's a little *bumpy*."
You should sing the sad small church song from that tape you found. Thought it was obvious...
You just stick your hand and *bind* it to the fridge door. The knob slides a little open. It's *gonna* help!
"*Ahem*... her position in this economy. Women are more delicate and less obedient than men... and more susceptible to all kinds of manipulation. But men are also more intelligent
Get the fuck outta here! You can't even *belittle* yourself in this crowd. You're *this* far, but you're not getting anywhere. It's...
Sounds like she's about to open up about something on this *special* trip. Maybe she'll tell you about that Klaasje thing? Hard to say right now, because you're so engrossed in your thoughts.
The man with the large head and disturbingly complex eating habits.
Of course there is the
"Very. Very very interesting."
You slouch your shoulders and blink your eyes, in silent contemplation. Your legs and your stomach appear to be made of porcelain...
"And what would you be using it for?"
There is no *lock* in his hand. It's a joke. Just a big empty word.
You're right. It makes no sense that you're alive and well in this world.
There's nothing you can see at this angle to stop it
"It's... not how it works, officer."
Okay, admit it -- you were curious about that tattoo, *Harry*. So maybe you shouldn't have...
No it's not. All of it.
then print 'A blurb from a horror novel.' (Write it down, like 'Whom is this?'.)
The boy gives you a quick two-finger salute.
The good doctor is not here right now, so don't draw conclusions from this. But he certainly would have had a say.
"If we're not careful, we may well descend into anarchy on this island." He stares at you, with grey eyes. "Anarchy!"
"So you were in some kind of a relationship?"
The uni-body chassis is a special case because the motor carriage has been modified to take up the rear wheels rather than the normally aspirated four-stroke.
Incorrect. Primitive infrastructure was built to withstand a possible artillery bombardment. The *artillery* didn't end up doing *anything* to the house, but it may have *somehow* gone under your mattress. Guess which one it was?
Not right now, no.
Wants the world to know she's unscrupulous, above all.
"A day off? I don't really have time for all this *time* anyway..." She lets go of the handle.
You could crack open the lid and get the rusty key, but you're *not* afraid of heights.
"I still can't get
On the Simao islet? There seems to be a quiet club there -- perhaps a *bonding* activity?
"You were in the Whirling-in-Rags, weren't you? You should really go tell the cafeteria manager."
[HIGH QUALITY] is a frequency band. It is used for high quality radio emissions, used in the RCM.
I was drunk when I left. And now I'm sober.
"He did? You think so? The stone wasn't the stone."
"Sure, I don't want to be the judge of your character... But..."
The water tower is not large enough to spare a plank. But it's there... the feeling of it grows strong.
Don't say it! Are you sure you want to do this? Even if you succeed you're gonna fail. And you won't be heard...
Hear that? You're about to rip off that mask of social democracy, the Man from Hjelmdall! You look like a young Jackpot artist and you're about to become the most unpopular person in the history of dancefloors with that face!
He puts more pressure on that 'fraternized conflict.' It's genuine. *Extremely* genuine.
She bows to inspect the wooden tokens. "The tokens are  incredibly valuable. If they weren't, no one would play
Sure sounds like a plan.
There's a brush of lint on the side of the bottle's canister.
Forgive me... I know it's tough...
You're not an idiot. You see they're having a hard time coming up with *anything* new.
This is your gun. Yours -- and now its use is purely aesthetic. Paint it, decorate it with weirdos!
"NOOOOOOOOOO!"
"You don't have a problem with cops? You're one of them! How can you even *do* police work when you're so law-abiding?"
That's understandable. Horses were prominent symbols throughout Stone's territory and even today they still are...
Both charts seem to indicate something about a... you know, not *that* terrible person in the sea.
The small girl is asking questions, not attacking? You might wanna refocus your thoughts a bit...
"I'm a police officer. Let's talk about normal police work."
An officer of the RCM? This is significant.
Patrol Officer Judit Minot stands here, a skeleton of concrete above the medical waste treatment plant. A short note from her reads: "Detective, you *were* wrong to question him. *You* should have gone with
You're right. There's something cold even now in there -- underneath it's a sylvan mask. A menace of the night. Remember? The *wild one* was wild because she was drunk. And she was blind. And she was freaking the world out.
At the request of the lieutenant, who was on the phone during the conversation, and not in violation of any *rules*.
"I've heard that *bad people* are scheming, but I haven't been able to substantiate that. I assume it's true, though."
He nods. "Now, let
The 9mm Villiers feels very strange, especially with all the new things in the world. The hole is especially large.
No need to overdo it. He won't mind sharing it with you.
Concentration makes you squint your eyes. Your name should be deep gold and orange, like a wound on a corpse that should be consumed.
Ok...well, if *not* being a cop is a *jail*, then *you* are a cop. What do you have to do to win my trust? Answer the doorbell? Get some *punches*?
As she does, you make out an object with patterns etched onto it. It's a handgun, the blue barrel of a 9 mm pistol.
An elemental of scarcity, the word "salami" conjures up images of salt and fresh produce. Salami can be deadly.
The boots look clean but still smell funky. This is one for later. Steal one and keep it somewhere safe.
There's a neat little nest of iguanas in the sand. An oak tree with a nest in its trunk.
"The bum, huh?" he lumps together.
The girthier one is sticking to the ceiling. There's no other way... it would be better if you weren't so worried about your *groin*
You shouldn't get so emotional before you know what to say. Maybe you should slow it down. Still, not good.
Yeah. So anyway -- young man, in his twenties, found with his skull busted open. Right on the floor of the hookah parlour. In the middle of the day. No one else is in there... And it's *unclear* what to do. Time to go back to being an idiot.
The non-stop dance music going! So do you. You're going to have to find something else to do. Like... Let's say, you know, whoa...
What *were* those people -- formless, disembodied, without substance -- he really wants to know. Where have you been?
I'll do my best, officer.
Now that you say it, it makes perfect sense.
"This kind of talk is *not* how brothers are supposed to behave," he shrugs, "but neither do I."
The deep bow down his neck lets out a little discomfort. "He's a good cop," he thinks, for a moment. Then he shakes it off...
Odd choice of words. You should know the first thing about *not getting angry*.
"Somethinkin. You don't seem to be too keen on the RCM when it comes to special projects, do you?"
It does not look like it. You should look at her with a blank, uninspired look on your face.
The little speak-o! What you did was *discreet* and 'part of the program' is what happens. Don't worry. You'll be safe behind this wall.
There's something in you that likes the sound of that. A dark piece of you wants to jump in. Right away.
The teenaged meerkats are here, fast approaching. You can sense it. The sky is overcast...
It's like a small, sick child. A child of some days past.
"Indeed. Since you *just* did. It's the thing that separates us. A man can't walk in the sun, eat a woman and walk away sober."
The pale, too, has almost entirely disappeared, a horrible stain on the moon that's been there for a century. Only the Graad side of the Turn of the Century Revolution remains, criss-crossing the land in a dream -- un-land
He nods, checking you out.
He shakes his head. "Pale-aged alcohol is most pleasant, but I won't be held responsible for what happens to my old collegues."
This is where I started off with my first kit. Ended up with my hand in the mirror. And my nose in the bottle.
I'm sorry this didn't do anything... usually hurting yourself does.
A shadow of sadness crosses the actress' face: "I can't tell you how many times I've been told by performers I shouldn't trust..." Her voice recedes.
The stall in the back is empty.
That *The Cuno* on that roof *Is* the Cuno that crashed into the sea and drowned in a raging river. A coarse parallel, but a parallel nonetheless.
As you open your eyes, you see a sinister silhouette against the window. The Union Jack is pulled higher than normal. An apparition...
Oh yeah, baby. You're the type of copy that cops read about. Steal your knowledge and it *will* inspire you to become a police officer.
"Fine, I'm sorry. But thank you. You didn't see anything."
She had some kind of occupation, back when she was still a student counsellor.
"Don't thank me," he says after a while, calmly.
A man in his thirties places his hands on the hammock's base. The shape of the wooden box is very recognisable: white under the blue sky.
A quick flash of recognition. The smile dissipates. "That's me! That's why I'm smiling. Yours for $10."
Run your finger across the metal.
"Not sure, but I'll keep looking..." He steps back from the window, still looking at the shadows cast
In the dark, oily water.
The kid keeps looking at the two of you with that half-intellectual expression, silently imploring you to stop. Then he turns to the man...
"I have yet to answer that."
What about the very end?
A sudden gust of wind turns the tables on the lieutenant, tipping him over the edge. The cries for help continue unabated, for the delicate operation of the steering mechanism.
"*You're* not?" He takes a long, wistful
"Where would I get ammo?"
Of course he didn't! Those are the Gothard signature signatures, a match made in heaven.
It's clear she *likes* him -- a young woman in her *dream*! But beneath it all there is something grave and foreign...
It seems that the all-important *reason* has been compromised. What remained was to placate Cuno.
It's like some premonition thing, getting *higher*. Like a flock of seagulls descending upon a seagull nest, or a flock of seagulls on a cliff side clinging to a branch, or a flock of seagulls on a building top floor clinging to a chitin grate...
The lieutenant narrows his eyes.
Despite their differences, these men are good men. You've no doubt jotted down some *high concept* ideas that way.
"Okay, I guess we'll see. Tell him I already told you, *and* we never met."
Suddenly you feel like the wheels of a transport... spinning around in the atmosphere. A day, a week, maybe even months away.
He's jealous. You shouldn't have... *assass*ed him. Why did you think it was possible?
A pair of boots with a faint logo appears from the snow. The sole pattern resembles those of a bicycle.
"Hnnnnnnnnnngggaaaaaahhh!"
The one your uniform is emblazoned with a pretty logo. It makes you think of a *little* older, a bit less vibrant...
He did, however, *accidentally* take out your camera. Thinking about it makes you uncomfortable. Just fire!
"Yes, I am. It's a nice place, but it's also a bit *stuffy*."
He's right. The wax paper *is* delicate. And drying, is the beating heart of the human spirit.
This means it's well funded. The paper is *still* signed by Hideaki Anno.
An incomprehensible pain. The words leave a residue in the back of your throat, as you swallow.
"This would also explain why the  plaza has become infested with bed bugs... It's not a pretty sight."
That's not it, they went through the effort of constructing this elaborate contraption.
The ice squeaks beneath the prybar. You find yourself covered in bruises, your back swollen from the impact.
You're only supposed to come back here once.
"It's not a thing any more, am I right?"
He laughs. "Trouble?" he says. "Garte is what you'd call us, we're part of the Revachol Independent Musical Instrument Coalition. And all of us together make up a pretty lousy call-in, at best."
Looking at him in that curious mix of company and employee sunglasses, the mixologist beams you a satisfied smile.
"What kind of an orange is that?"
There *has* to be a way to wake up Anna.
<why do you care?> The fire in you recedes, the ether floats to the winds.
"I had a friend who was in his thirties and in need of a bit of cash. The first time I took him to a new haunt -- in '31 -- he was just starting to feel better about what had happened..." He takes a long sip of his drink.
You *are* cold.
I don't have to fight fire with fire. [Discard thought.]
The cloud slowly moves its tendrils of cloth toward the lake. The waves lap against the submerged tag. "I believe it in two seconds," it says, holding up the photo of the phasmid. "It's a pity, but it's an empirical truth."
Someone here is missing. The walls and floors are rotting, and the mould rots slowly... you can hear the clamor inside. A great battle rages within him...
That fucking ice bear fridge! What is this shit?!
"Racist mugs in the trash! Racist mugs in the trash!"
They're like little peas of meat on a stick, that's how they are. Be very *handsome* to the lieutenant.

Wait, stop! Kim... what was that about an *incompetent* in charge?
A very small number of people -- over fifty at least -- remain in the *entry* camp, underground for three months, weathering the monsoon rains and cigarette smoke with amphetamines and alcohol.
The man is obviously doing something, he just can't remember what.
Could it be all those men who have fallen off the wagon? Whispering somewhere, yet not speaking? You could try speaking to them, see what they have to say. But do you have any questions before you ask? No, this is going too far...
You should go ahead and share this information with her, just in case.
The man has almost certainly had medication -- and probably also annoid to get him off pot -- all for the *slight* of his having been a medic.
He looks north and across the

A battered linoleum box from the floor, half eaten by rats... You can't see the inside of the refrigerator any more.
"There may be, but there is no proof. You're in a dream, officer."
He shakes his head. "No, we're not really supposed to talk about politics in school. Unless you want to ask about the wound... Then you should probably talk about the fence."
Two empty bottles of ''Tutti Frutti'' are slumped against the wooden panel, one on each side... you guess the theme is... off?
Looks like a set of domes -- simple rickety wooden houses built into mountainsides. A few of the hillsides are also dotted with domes, some half a century apart.

Maybe you should change it. They were talking about something *extra*. Something extra special. Extra cute. Cuddly.
"You're not really an officer anymore, are you?"
Try the 'Wants to Get Up.' command.
You could push the pop quiz timer as long as you like, but you may want to limit your exposure to the lorryboy so as not to trip on the chain.
"That'd be unprofessional of you."
It's a discussion you could have with your 11-year-old son. Ask him about punk rock, arty stuff.
You hear what appears to be a sigh, but which is actually a bunch of condensation, leaving no throat-respiratory sensation.
A glimpse of panic. She tries to bolster her resolve by throwing you a look, but it's cloudy.
"It's not just your money that's in there. There's also a "co-divergence" in each unit, as the units are pooled together to make the overall total. Of this -- the A10 will take over the freight. The A55, the L-shaped intersection on the river..."
On the transparent plastic ball -- Õkomarsá karaný, or *karaoke*, sung at the insistence of the owner. The ball has *many* holes in it, but only one person has noticed: you.
He was not surprised to hear that -- and that he's not allowed to criticize the command structure.
Wait, that *is* precisely what the punks have done. Their scams have always been filled with lies and half-truths. It's always had something to do with the *phone phasmid* -- at the bottom of the ocean floor you see a stick insect, creeping towards you --
"'Cause it's a *month*, you don't really know what you're gonna get. But thanks for the hint, mister."
There are dangers out there, she thinks -- just not knowing them will make her uncomfortable.
They're not even mixed. You wouldn't even know what they are, much less describe them.
I'm afraid I'm a six-eyed mental health professional.
The chain is knot-ty, the badge in your hand... It would truly come in handy to have the abrasive end of the chain tested in this
Because he knows the party's over, *bratan* -- look at him raise his beer!
"You know, Harry -- I thought you might have noticed... *other* things. In the city, for example. That the hulks have taken over most of the downtown district."
"Great news then, officer! I'm a survivor, I'm trying to make it up in my last year on this planet." He rubs his eyes and says, simply...
"You *definitely* don't want to know."
Would it be a good idea? To take out the magnetometer first?
This is me putting my finger on the strange, *alien* thing that's shining through the window.
An empty bottle of  whatever the spirit bomb is.
"Huh?" She laughs.
"You know, it's really me."
"Oh, it's not actually me..."
The thickness of the cloth may vary.
"On the coast of Martinaise, in the district of Martinaise..." The lieutenant studies the bird over his shoulder. "I believe it was a Neufchatel 27. A few months or so ago. This has been captured by a seafort off the coast. It's manned by three men."
This was the one the lieutenant recommended. The one he *pawned off* so he wouldn't have to deal with it himself.
In our relatively short time together, you've shown the world a little of what you know.
The blade is oddly smooth against your jaw. It makes your _big_ smile vanish...
Of course, *yes* sir. It's been a while since you've thought about this and all you can do is wait for your sidekicks to talk.
The rifle has.
"The man I've been seeing is the man in the coloured lorry."
The cellphone rings in your pocket.
She seems relieved. That's it -- she's ready to talk about the attack. All she needs is a punch.
You snatch the document out of your coat pocket. The *vow* you signed makes it very clear that you intend to not just take the security deposits, but also to run the city: you're going to do it -- without the lieutenant.
The end result is an 8% ABV spirit, nearly double the strength of base spirit. It's also considerably cheaper, at least relative to other distilleries.
"Are you or have you ever been a paramedic?"
"As I said, about halfway done here, officer," he says in a very deliberate tone. "Let's talk about something else."
"Right on." She throws the beer can into the container with an audible pop. It lands inside, clean and dry.
"I think this is a very bad idea."
It's... uhm... a Cuno.
"That's enough of this *debate* now," he says finally. His gaze wanders off into the distance.
"No, thanks. Sorry, officer."
The gathering storm is abuzz with discussion and hopes. Emotions run high. People are having arguments about the world's most mundane things.
There's a crunch. The tyres under the bonnet are waiting for you to say something. You keep saying nothing.
But I meant -- got to keep the *party spirit* in check.
The freshwater alligators? There are alligators in the river, in the forgotten tower. There was something about water -- alligators in the sea, floating down on the water. It was an ancient fear.
He turns back to you. "Let's go to the island club. It's closer. They've got those books and *so many* DVDs..."
Does he know something about those guns he's selling?
He gives you a *very* hard stare. "Don't fuckin' rush it. You don't know how you're gonna catch it -- or if you'll even catch it at all..."
Abort! You'll never know what happens when people call you "Master Chief." You'll never know what they'll do to you, when they call you by your first name.
Stopped *The Expression*
Look, there's a legendary upside-drinking alcoholic who saved your life once...
"Yeah, I guess you're right." He taps on the side of
What? No. It's impossible. You've worn that grin into your face and now it's just a big gaping wound -- who's to say you'll be un-or-di-nuncian?
It's all over now. You drowned in your *hoard* and now it's all gone. Almost. You'll be *badly* back in it...
That's why he doesn't want to talk about it. You have enough to deal with, at least the fact that you have a body...
"I don't know, I'm not an expert."
The boy keeps it together, looking tired. The older brother looks on, trying to contain his curiosity.
"No, I meant the union."
There must be millions of micro-organisms living within that soil... you would have to be *blind* to see it.
Oh no.
"I think the regular order of things is still the way things are -- the 'one-two-three' rule. The RCM, as we say, has its quirks, but mostly they follow one of our tempo standards. For example, they call our tempo medium-tempo."
She's silent for a second. Just a small tremble of the left side of her face... Then she speaks again: "It was very necessary to capture this individual and bring him to justice."
You grab hold of the chest. You hear the 'Crack it!' of a gunshot. Your eyelids close...
"Then I can keep the glass. I *don't* have to talk to Evrart." The lieutenant doesn't know what to say.
"We are in the year 2200 A.D. The last of the thirty two *biggest cities in the world* according to the United Nations. Its population is some thirty million people."
Great, a metal detector.
She sighs. "I guess it's only a *little*. Still, somehow you managed to scare the living shit out of me..."
That's right. Ruby's not the bad one. She probably has an apartment in a larger city and *just* walked in. A video rental?
While Evrart's men are distracted by your weirdos, chief Machinist Ivan The Terrible is organizing a massive superior offensive against Jamrock.
They're no more than three figures in a row standing in front of the old man. They would have to be shanked.
To the cops.
An imperceptible tremble passes his left side. It's pointed in the direction of the ship. It has to be seen to be believed.
The lieutenant glances at the battery-powered device, then at the empty cigarette package.
He looks at the stone slab. "I'm not sure I *can* trust it, sire. There's something wrong with that eye... I don't know..."
Tien-En was a unstable power, spinning his webs and getting in every other guy's way. He was also, let's be honest, lacking in a few *nerves*. Turns out that's quite handy for when you need to scare someone..."
I'm sorry, you racist! You know where that majority is supposed to be -- on your farm. Not here! Don't threaten or harass the woman!
"I'm ready." The last third of the question is unimportant.
"Now that we've inspected the scene -- I want to know more about that ... bomb you were trying to blow up."
A desire for vengeance? This is a touchy topic for him.
Not all of them. There's more out there. In the world.
"Possession is theft."
So he's fine. Don't
As you see it, the lorry driver raises a right eyebrow. "My partner recommends we put the case in storage -- so she doesn't have to get involved in this shit again."
An instant camera -- the Trigat Sunshine Mini. A moan of discomfort sounds from the lazareth, as he turns onto his side...
"I don't have any money. We don't have enough money to buy more booze."
"I've got some ideas how you solve this murder."
This woman has tremendous willpower. I *have* to force her to think before she says something.
"Murderers, boiadeiros, cheaters, lorries... you have asked them all to grant you certain absences."
What's the deal with the toilet paper?
Am I flattery? There is no way to tell. This isn't how he came to be here. You have to trust him.
Underneath it all he is calm and collected. A wise choice, he thinks -- he's worried for you.
For the moment he's indifferent to the cameras. The speedfreak moves on, confidentially -- still interested in the jacket himself.
She gives orders like she's a cornered animal, and she's being cornered.
"She didn't do it."
A formal apology? Then why does she still need his money?
A sudden gust of cold air comes down on you. The wind sets the table before you, but it doesn't seem to affect the figure on it...
Well, *bratan*... it will be *interesting* to see what this boy says. He looks like a little *too* excited about it.
"Yes, I'm sure. Thank you for thinking of it, Harry. It's nice to talk to a straight man about my matters."
Keep still. Breathe in.
You could ask her about your hung over buddy. You could ask her if you found out the hard way...
The skin around it is plastered with a fine layer of rust. The eyes are large and round, bulging into the brim of his hood. On the underside of his armor -- nothing but a rough map of Revachol.
"What the fuck did you do?"
You can't just leave it like that -- you have to take it further. Slam it down, *immediately*.
It *really* has, isn't it? There is some people out there -- down there on Martinaise. In a boat. In a boat harbor.
The top of his hat is like an aerostatic, dancing above the falconry. A thin layer of frost covers his bald head.
There is an entire section devoted to cures for men who are struggling to perform their "marital obligations."
Yes! You do. The *fourth* is the most crucial one. Here's how you do it:
And those are the good examples.
No, not a ghost, a *ghostly* cop. This is Cuno, the *adulting cop*. And he's gone. He is not okay with you bringing up the ghostly part.
"We already decided to give it back."
"Let's have a look at that door again."
Her hair is dyed blonde. She's tidy and well groomed.
No. Don't lose your cool. You just lost it.
I can't see it.
(Stop staring at her eyes and smile). "*You* look like shit."
If it's possible, then by what right did *you* get up?
The real fun begins now.
In any case, you've made your way back to the timber, where you've stayed for the last few days. You still have your funky-axel and plastic-magnets -- now you just need to find the rest.
Don't follow through on this.
An ominous, *alien* presence?
Those are the *black boxes* we're talking about here. The silent black boxes from your early years. These are the 40 years of silence that have been eating at your psyche, leaving no space for growth or change.
"Okay, I'll ask later." He rub
"That's what I thought. Wasn't crazy. I was just straight in my head."
I don't know, I'm not a *young* psychologist. I'm a businessman.
A note of caution before starting this *miracle*. By proxy -- anyone can become a master of Time Disappearance. It's a bizarre world -- one in which anyone can disappear at any time. But when you think about it, and you have to think about it again...
Offensive pillow? Really? You know the name of one rock group that does, and they're not called *that*.
It's all a twisted melodrama staged by the system, he thinks. It's impossible to see inside your head; only that strange electronic music she's hearing through the speakers...
Poor, sad old lady. You went out into the street without knocking. In the middle of the streets. And now she is listening to you.
"That you're not... but I suppose you're the Semenese equivalent of the Prince of Tequila Sunset."
(Start tugging on your tie.) "Damn, we should've burned that stupid B-side. I'm too old to see it now..."
It's the *Confirmed Shot* -- *You're* not wearing anything any more. Your honour is worthless. Do you understand?
An individual high on ammonia? No, it's... wait, no, it's the Chairman of the Board. The wonderful Chit-Chat-Tribunal.
"Suspicious of me?" She looks at you with genuine curiosity.
"Wants to drink more. I'm gonna help you pay for your booze with this sandwich you're making."
The bear's eyes are still glowingly yellow -- it seems it's silently pondering something, its belly button pressed against the plastic.
Oh my god, *boreal anatomy*. This is something to be cautious of. Even when you *know* you
Her voice drops to a whisper: "The humans are abandoning him... they're abandoning him like he's the hornet's ass."
You get a sense of dread from her, as you pull the hood over your eyes... Then you move your hands to the scarf around her neck and into your pockets.
"Okay, why not?" The lieutenant looks at the leafless rags under the blanket and laughs. "What else are you going to say, old man?"
She doesn't want to admit it but the fact that Ruby's not there... is it some kind of a... kind of a *gift*?
He shrugs. "But we both agreed it was important for Lung to be heard, and we *need* to do it again. Because we are about to embark on an investigation into this -- and it *has* to end.
"Yeah, it's pretty fucked up if you tell me it was your fucking idea." He stops, as though it's your turn to speak.
The yellow key fits in the dim light well. If it weren't for the trap's insides it wouldn't be able
"I feel like I'm part of something... a little more than I want to be. It's like it's always been this way with me... But I am strong enough now..."
But they tried to ram it down her throat, after she'd already gone... how would they know?
"A squat, fleshy-looking person, about 200 kilograms, who lives inside the chimney and, well, you know -- smells bad."
Thinking about drinking is like thinking of a cocaine habit. You have to *definitely* take a hit or two before you get clean.
Boy there are a lot of metaphors going around right now. Let's get back to thinking about the tape.
Right. I have no fucking idea what's wrong with you, the way you're gonna ask me to start throwing around term papers? Fine. I'll just be blunt.
The sky is indifferent to your silent nod, but the lieutenant seems to enjoy it. He gives you a fleeting smile.
"First, how did you learn our names? How did you learn I was a cop?"
He pauses, taking it in. "Either way, it's definitely a case against the communists -- or the socialists, actually... I think he'll be more open to talking about it if it was organized better."
"The fuck?" He doesn't say anything.
"I don't care if he's your brother, I'm just a drunk cop with a bag of coke in him."
"I mean, when people die. It's awful,
"Don't do drugs! People are gonna die!"
Stop, relax your eyes. (Just a moment ago you were looking at the city and the sea and your mind was clear of the past few weeks.)
They *barely* note the glimmering carabineer. The crater they left in the sand, the slight seismic tremor they caused in Revachol.
An eerie silence, all things considered. Perhaps this is the end of her tale?
He looks at the old man. "Hey, you should try shaking that shit *and* seeing if it'll open the door. Only the former was on by me and the latter..."
When?
"But I thought we were having fun together, like we had been talking about movies all the time."
"I've come to give you the gun."
He sighs. "You've got a body and a mind and I have no control over either of you. It's inexcusable."
For an instant your cheeks are tinted blue, as you look at the ULAN frequency table. The relic is illuminated, inviting you to stand.
"I don't know about, T... I dunno, speed or some shit..." He pulls on his cigarette nervously.
"Okay. So you wanna fuck with me then?"
He rubs his face again. "Why should we just leave it like that? Why are you *calling* the shots here?"
"There's a legend we've all heard about. When the old right-wing bossman tried to have sex with some of his workers, he got very sick and killed them all."
Another theory, but not bad enough to pull off in a real-life setting. Better to keep it that way.
The lieutenant's right -- something always comes up between here and that locker. The smell, the noise, even the sweat...
NEVER AGAIN. Stop, don't ever do that again. It's the *she* who did it, remember?
An old silver postcard with the *Wirrâl* drawn in large block letters. The artwork has undergone several transformations, each time preserving the spirit of the original.
It's certainly an honour to kill.
Sure. We're just flicking a switch here. Isn't it the detectively term for when something is discovered but before it's fully explained?
It was an honour and a tragedy, dad. You will never be able to *get* to the mystery inside this case -- that's for sure.
"Do I look like I'm a clod-murderer?"
Boring, boring, BORING!
"You, let's go have a little boy and learn our lesson, okay? We can just walk in, turn up the volume..."
So you're guessing *yes*?
Just like that. You hear a rattle -- a small pop, like meat being pulled apart. The sound disappears as the creature disappears completely into the wall of the trap.
Okay, there's *one* more -- and it's important. The pygmies are orientals, meaning they're poles that orbit the sun around the earth. This makes them dangerous, but also incredibly useful in extreme cold.
The copier paper is soaked with ink, its pages torn and dried. The amount of pages in an officer's file is staggering.
Who'd have thought it was possible? Probably your eyes only catch on things you don't want to see.
That's a good way to go.
You see two bluish snakeskin shoes.
You see a really,
The wooden tokens lie strewn across the floor. Like a great many other things here, in all the hallways, there's a commonality -- *pale* blood.
Something's wrong. You have serious health problems and you haven't been drinking, but now this...
The cameraman has set down a sharp focus on the large man's features. You see the result: three-dimensional, mechanical: a camera, man with a camera, filming you.
You're stuck here. If you want to talk about *anything*, this is it. You can't think about *anything* else.
Is it a pang of sadness, or triumph?
It *is* a bit strange that no one in your position ever hears the word *merciful*. There's something suspicious about this arrangement.
You see the seediest possible DNA sample -- nothing but black speckled irises. A blur of microscopic *togetherness* on a glass slide.
You're not sure you *can* stop. All it takes is willpower...
See, this place is completely ruined. Maybe you shouldn't have missed.
"Glad to have been of assistance. Will you return to me with the flashlight, please?"
Don't say it. [Finish thought.]
You feel the neon lights of the Whirling-In-Rags twinkle on the wooden collar, then disappear behind the wall of the box. The surface of the man's neck starts moving...
He turns back to you with a wince. "It was probably for the best, because Filippe didn't last very long at all..."
"Just a premonition. The continuation of an older order."
The geologist picks up his pen, scribbles something on the paper, then hands it back to you: "Please continue your researches at home."
Roughly the same height as Mister Dean, he looked straight at you and said: "Don't worry, man. I'm not going anywhere."
You can almost see it... a small puff of smoke. A chandelier of light reflected in that flask, like the reflection of that of a fine mead on a beach.
What's happening to me?
"That they do... I suppose they do. But what does that have to do with *you*? You're the one *sabotaging* this mess."
The door is slightly more forbearing.
You should sing that sad song you were listening to last night. Thought it was obvious...
A yawn. His eyelids hang shut.
With your hands? Your honour seems unimportant to him right now. Better to get back to the story.
This makes her feel uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the duel you witnessed on the bridge? It's possible.
He's not joking. You shouldn't take this "seriously". Move on.
He nods. "I guess it makes sense that an evolved individual might be partial to aesthetic over scientific advancement."
The dicemaker laughs out loud. "I love the crazy-o, but *that's it* -- we're not moving any more!"
She shifts around aimlessly, in what appears to be a stupor.
Some radical leftist pamphlets still cling to the back cover. The title reads: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Three-Eyed Skull."
After a while you realize it's not worth it. Besides, the scruffy-haired little boy in the picture...
There it is, sparkling in the dark.
"Hunch over what happened, huh? That *is* odd. Let's go and get a new tape then."
The storekeeper sees you eyeing the goods behind her. "I'm obliged to inform you that both alcohol and cigarettes damage your health."
It doesn't look like you can take it. A direct hit from a moving vehicle would likely do the trick.
"How much did it cost you, officer?"
Don't you see the pythons flying about?
There is something in the reeds, deep down -- a shadow on the roof. Even now, some of the particles remain lodged in the reeds.
By the way, where *is* the desert you just mentioned? That's because it's so hellish in reality.
The lieutenant removes a little blue plastic card from his pocket. "This one's a bit worried about her..."
This is the camera you are looking for. You've searched every room in the building.
Hesitating on the truth.
"This book says it all, but it didn't do it, did it say it *longingly*?"
He's drawn out and guilt-ridden, a man in his prime. He has no respect for authority, never has and he never will.
After several turns your hand is nearly wrapped around the game's heart. You are left holding the empty bottle -- with the sinister feeling that there is more than meets the eye.
The young woman looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you. A little startled, she takes her hand from your shoulder to shoulder: "I'm okay..."
A *boîte* with a rifle is a barrel-mounted cannon that fire projectiles made from wood, metal, or other hard objects.
He gestures you to silence the music.
You try to measure his frame, his features. The lounge is affectionate.
Nice try, but what is a schematic of an experimental engine?
Get a hold of yourself. You're going to have this round -- and there's nothing you can do about it.
The kingdom of Conscience is one that has been locked away in a palace of pain, for the sake of scientific rigour and democratic principles.
Reconstruct the shattered window.
Let's not even get into that right now. (Refuse task.)
Not all of them. Not my brother, he was just a *joker*.
Two cables are plugged into the breaker box. The red one leads to the ice bear fridge and the black one to the ice cream maker nearby.
Perhaps you did *not* notice... there's something *wrong*. With your eyes blindfolded, you crusade through the city streets, taking pithy phrases and making them say something. Some of them even say it *unforgettable*.
"You're just... having difficulty believing what it says on the tin." He looks at you with confusion.
"She... really is insane." He sounds concerned. "I'm not doing much to assist you any longer, Harry. For one, you're really bad at it, and for two, I don't know how you're going to make me feel about her..." He looks to the kitchen. "Anyway, no problem."
The salesman shakes his head, but not for long. "I am sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you'd... Oh, no, I don't know either. Don't waste my time -- I'll have more to do later. Like... Do you want more questions?"
What was that about him being scared of you? Don't let him scare you! He's probably just tired from playing at all.
Don't worry. They'll be here soon enough. You'll get the chance to breathe once you're done with this.
It's *important*. Who watches out for the boy with no memory left in the world?
Outside, a driveway winds its way through a residential neighborhood. Cinder block houses are replaced by tropical islands in the sand: palm fronds and rainforests. Mountainsides are replaced by simple palm fronds, and what was once a lake becomes a beach.
He is still not really paying attention.
Keep it together, you're about to rip off that mask of social democracy and reveal the monstrous five-eyed monster in its
The tracks have been there for quite some time.
It might be a good idea to sing the one note before waiting for the others to play out their parts...
He looks at the ball in your hand, then at you. "The ballistics involved in the hit couldn't have come from the roof. I see no problems with that. And no evidence of hiding it."
I mean he does *not* *want* the fight. He *needs* the fight. But he *will* not allow it to happen.
The lightweight clip screwed into the wooden panel adds a *linchpin* to the military-grade structure.
He examines the card, his finger on the pulse of the flame imprinted on its back. "Can you believe it? We used to
You let your whole head go grey. The imprints feel heavy.
We should go and look around in the cabin, see what this giant ice bear fridge is all about.
They didn't give *The Expression* permission to flourish.
You know it in your lungs where the pressure reaches. In your heart where the pressure starts.
An *old man*? Are you sure you're clear enough to understand this?
They're *really* questioning you right now. This man needs to understand that he's been *hurt* -- by you. And he will
"What? Oh, the kids are so good! I guess they make up for lost time sometimes..." He studies the traps, idly yawning. "I think they called them boomboxes..."
"Well... I did see the strangest thing.
"Hello, officer."
An instant camera -- the light of some city on fire -- flicks on.
"They were the luckiest and most famous of all the companies in the city, at least according to the Vitamins. For much of its history the company's capital was invested in top-of-the-line equipment. It included... velour jackets."
If you're so well versed in police work, why can't you remember your district?
"A blindfold like that? I couldn't even see a lambe on it! The cage was full of… other things."
All those questions and more you don't even *get* to ask? That's not possible. There is no time. It's not possible to ask while the Spirit Bomb is in effect.
"Aye, so here you are, you blind emo degenerate." He's smiling. "So what are you trying to do, lawman?"
You look down at the white ceramic sabatons hugging your arches and calves, confused and annoyed. This is your life and you can't make it any worse than it is.
"It was not about the cockatoo."
You sneak up on the fly buzzing like a drum, looking for a smell you've kept hidden for too long. When you turn the corner, you see the familiar waft of soap -- wafting through the reeds.
"But it *really* doesn't."
The jet pack is still warm from your reaction, and as if it were on fire right next to you. You feel it and it's cold.
Yes, the picture is not here. It must be the show... The ***will go on repeat, live forever***!
In the twisted air above the roundabout, Revachol is governed by the laws of physics and reason -- and the machinations of men.
"No... I meant the hornet's nest, okay? We're not just after the pheromone."
It's as if you're *in* the world again.
Give back to the workers.
"So, what are you going to say now?"
The young man looks up at you, then down at his hands. The soles of his feet are greenish.
Your fingers, more accustomed to this situation, reach back into the ball-like logic of the pack.
Under the evening sky the great district sleeps: A chessboard of wooden houses in the snow, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
He considers this for a moment. "It's an empirical fact. If you want to live, you need to *live*. "
Pale-aged vodka? This is rare game indeed. Solving problems and solving stories together is what real crime requires.
The lad gives you a sincere look of disdain, then smiles. "Yes, that's a strange thing to suggest..."
Why... this low percentage?
He looks down. "If I may. I just wanted to make sure you were well taken care of here."
The remotest possible area, that barely covers half the city. The only place in Martinaise you should not *not* is *outside*.
"What was her name?"
Your outstretched hand basks in the cool spring water.
Just a change of clothes.
Wait, there's something else there...
Towering over the canister, you look down at the beer. It's impressive, but can it really justify the *risk* of opening such a vale?
Then she'll repeat it. For *seven* more years.
It's a mistake. You are falling into the trap set by the other guys. They will never believe what you tell them.
Exactly. You should be drunk too! If it's under your belt, you should be able to do it. But you don't have a gun...
"So... was this the Northlands? It's now or never, buddy-boy. Diggin' in, brave friends."
There was something else there, in the way she stood.
"This business with the ivy... it's never over!"
Branch movement analysis.
"Thank you, Mr. Dros." The lieutenant looks at you with unexpected affection. "I'm glad I could help out."
The warm afternoon sun radiates from the footprints in the dusty yard, casting shadows on the floorboards.
"Very nice. You really brought the party spirit this week."
This is also a mistake: You misheard your cue card as Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Love, not Jacob Irw. Make sure you say you're Jean-Luc Picard, not Jean-Luc!
Bag the poleax.
"You did not say *disco*?"
She's truly ashamed of the >casual psychosis epidemic rocking Revachol.
She doesn't trust you. That's it. You've got him. All the workers in Revachol have joined in on this sad duty.
An instant camera -- the Trigat Sunshine Mini. Tilt your head from side to side, snapping the wind.
What a simple thing to do. You should share your tips with him too, so he doesn't have to be so cold.
"I think I've never met a police officer who's as crazy as you."
A good, stable home for a *beacon of sound* in the middle of a forest... probably a Mistral or a Mistral-class transport.
Alcohol and heartbreak.
Hmm... you feel your legs shaking under you and your gun hand move to your holster -- but only a *th ** hand could reach such an object...
There's a reason very few players ever attempt to build a public education system for their worker tokens: It's extremely expensive and never works out...
"What?" He looks confused. "What did you say?"
It's... not as bad as you thought. The whiskey is still there, but the rest of the poisons have all left your mouth.
Your muscles ache, your neck moves, your lip smacks the ocean... No one sees your grimace. You're too ashamed to say you're sorry anymore.
The man drops the near-finished cigarette lingering between his fingers. He reaches for a new one, with a practiced look...
The constrictor ion is among the most common bird species in Revachol. Known for its girthy billowing cargo belt, it's hard to imagine a more useless shell than a propeller-driven airplane.
It is precisely what you needed. Patience, persistence, and a *smile* -- your secret weapon.
"So what is that thing?"
I'm not giving it to you.
These terms sound like they're not going to work on this stinking corpse.
The *lever* is a term that, while used with little or no actual *luck* in mind, approximates the effect of pure *sola verde*.
There's nothing like the sound of a blade clashing with metal against metal. The world's inhabitants will be infuriated, but you will have won them all over.
You almost feel *compelled* to point out that you *are* wondering...
He nods. "It would only last a day or two, but I *also* need to talk with Greg and Eugene." He shrugs. "There's no way I can tell Lely. Eugene's a cop. And L.A. No longer exists in my head. And L
"No need to humiliate yourself. You're one of us now."
"Have you ever *seen* a crime scene?"
Did you hear that, Cop Blockbuster? A self-contained narrative that fits so well *inside* the bounds of reality. Like a novella. Like a *second* novella.
He takes out the photo of the phasmid and shows it to the officers across the yard. The wind blows, clothes flutter in the breeze.
Now that you hold it in your hands -- a precious artifact from a once great company -- there is no telling when it will start to melt...
The stew man, on the left, seems to be enjoying himself. He looks right at the pot -- then right back at you with a smirk on his face.
She nods. "The boy likes to talk trash. I hope he gets what he's done with the FALN. Showcasing those animals is a way to entertain the FALN faithful."
She hasn't been able to tell the story up until this moment.
"It was such a stupid thing to do."
There it is, almost in your lungs: the word *eternal* being uttered. On the lips of man and beast. On the lips of man and...
That's it. You should do this no more.
"Whoa. Hazy." She puts her arm around you. "Very deep, very deep, man. Can't say if it's related to the cold spell."
"Well. I have, for example, more than my fair share of cases of this ilk. I've been in many, and..." She gives out a quiet laugh. "I have no problems with them. They're all just kids."
"Yeah, man. If you're *not* hearing me, I'm not *sure* what I'm doing." He snorts and turns to leave.
I've been trying to tell you for a long time that this is one of the books you shouldn't have, that there's more to life than bimonthly romances. But you don't listen, cause your life circumstances prevent you from being *reasonably* involved in this matter.
You are touching an ancient piece of cloth with an ancient blade, as it were, and it feels... strange.
If you insist. But you've already made *this* guy give you 10%, so... it's only a *pinch* more likely that you succeed.
Keep it together. You can't make out what he means here. He's trying to reassure you.
You see two blankets, one blue and the other red. The other, a blue one, lies on the ground. It looks like trash.
You get the feeling you should've offered to help, but you didn't. Well, it's time to try again, right?
W / /!88 POLICE OFFICER II *AA* DRUNK *AGENT* COLLAPSING EACH -- *AA* DRUNK II *AAAAAHHHHH!* W / /!88 POLICE OFFICERS *AA* DRUNK *AAAHHH!* W / /!88 A OFFICER FINDS THIS PLACE HOLY / /!/ W/TIL THE WORLD IS HANGING.
"Can you just turn it off, please?"
What has it done?
"Yes. Why didn't they just tell me that..." He looks around, fascinated.
You should pick it up, you smell it too...
The *Canal* is undertaken, for the time being, to keep you safe from the madmen who will take your place -- it's a bond they can't even begin to imagine.
"Um... ? Who *kind* of chortle?"
"He's an outstanding linguist, really. Couldn't even speak before he had the sign out."
One year has passed. In a brown folder next to the main desk of the Public Prosecutor's office in Martinaise. In this folder you see a series of papers -- yellow, a serial number.
The white triangle slowly appears above the lieutenant's head... then it's already unsheathed. He looks at the tool with utter sadness...
You don't know, *it* might be the true scale model of all time. Maybe you should just ask her about it, so you don't have to wait.
You know it in your lungs where the cadaverine is coming from. And it in your kidneys from the killed animal. But you don't know what the hell it tastes like.
Somewhere in the immense past that preceded us, before the buildings were put up, there was a campaign launched by Revacholian nationalists against the Siigay regime. The conflict ended with the Omaharoa people taking back their native land. Remember the name of the tribe: Stas-Rajko.
You give them both the finger pistols they're carrying and tell the lieutenant you've seen them both nakeds.
Fuck it, it's not happening. You've worn that grin into her face for far too long. Eventually it will wear off entirely...
Here, on this roof, in this house... there is very little. It's a miracle you don't melt down.
"You won't believe it. The person who took the documents for the club -- he also got the documents for the Union. I think he was working on his paperwork outside when the documents arrived."
It's a trap. She's baiting you.
What was the password?
What's below?
You try to make out anything recognisable, but the mould lines just make out a super-long time ago.
I was thinking the same thing. Get a hold of yourself, son -- do you have anything to lose?
Perhaps... There is a tradition of some kind... that Ruby started having doubts about, and hiding a century ago.
"No, I'm not gonna do that. It's not part of the game."
She's lying. She doesn't want you to feel guilty about the death of the love of your life.
Then you should take the gate from Evrart and go for the pilot area... make it clear who's boss.
A brilliant swarm of driverless 'Astra' vehicles drives alongside the motorway, high above the highway. They too are frozen in place, silently chanting *Hurricane Maria*.
It's not about the trap, it's about what he's found.
"I haven't asked about that."
He was *bought* off-site. Off-site means 'outside' -- that is, outside the territorial waters of Mundi.
"It doesn't matter. What matters is that you have the tools to take down this person." He
"At any rate, the citizens of Revachol
"Yes, you. I see you. Are you ready?"
You were warned not to bring it up! Bring it up only after they've already gone on stage and act like a schmoozer.
She doesn't flinch. You've knocked him out cold with a punch.
You're definitely right.
She won't. Not this time.
This isn't working, the alphanumeric down the pit in your throat started with: 001. This is the number of a special consultant from Precinct 41. An unidentified cryptofascist was his colleague.
She doesn't *personally* know anything about the armour. That's the least of your worries right now.
Inside the box the words "SEMIOTECT ACCRUDA" have been stamped into the wooden box. The date of 2130 has been added.
He takes out the photo of the phasmid and shows it to the officers across the yard. It makes *Klaasje* proud to be from these 'Accidents.'"
You grab the chaincutters and proceed to leisurely dispatch the workers. Before long, the national treasury has been liquidated and a new one has emerged: LUM, the King's tax. Not bad at all.
"I'm... fine, actually."
There is no compulsion here, the only thing holding it back is your own hard work. Will you give it 100%?
"He's just telling jokes."
He means the least here. He would have the most to lose here -- to the political consequences of your careless leadership.
She doesn't flinch -- the motion is assured. A masterplan needs to be approved by the high command -- and this plan is perfect.
"I don't really like either way."
The storm drains. The flanks of motor lorries. Beyond that -- the quadrennially revitalized waterfront. City blocks like Fort Scott, even bigger, looser. Damaged by the bullets of the world.
Just an ordinary wall. Nothing to see here.
He sees the checkpoint.
"MISSING LIVING EVENTS
For what it's worth, victory is all he ever wanted. Never had any other goal than to rid the world of the oppressive Handmaid's Code.
Sounds like he knows the station work load isn't that high -- he just didn't want to say that out loud.
In the not-so-distant past, this city has been a crucible for technological progress.
It's a *mythos*, don't fall for it. There will be severe consequences if you try it on her again.
A library card now! You know, it's not often you get someone to talk about books in public...
No. A part of you knows you should go on. Look at those wings. You *want* to go on. You need to see that gleam in the dark.
"Nah, man. It's a little too *extreme*, but I guess the point is moot anyway."
"Oh, okay." He's trying to remain upbeat despite the
He points to the staircase. "You need to come back if you see anything irregular -- the loop is closed."
You might be lying. There's something here.
"It's a hunch. But something about this forgotten soldier suggests to me... maybe *there's a reason*."
Someone's bound to find it -- he's been arguing the point of the tape so often that he's become tired of it himself. You may need to give it a few moments to get it out of you...
Something stirs in the hold, as though the cork was about to come out. The lieutenant looks at you and sighs.
Breathing, are you sure? Your heart beats a little faster at the thought.
He's smirking, the iciness has lifted.
Your finger snaps back, as though his life had gone on forever.
"I don't know, I dunno."
Great idea! We could do it like we did with the broken radar. Just blow this joint and it'll be fine.
"So you're saying the *Noid* did it?"
You should have had the strength to take her down a peg or two back then. But, you see, you were not *in* the habit of pointing guns at innocents...
"What about the kids then?"
_______________________________________________________ -->Fell into the alleyway in Central Sola. Too late -- the cameras were rolling, your name was singed in the papers. Now only the worst nightmares haunt your mind... _______________________________________________________
"That would depend on the circumstances. I'm not here to negotiate."
What?! Speed most definitely *is* for... No one knows for sure, but it seems he once practiced frolicking naked on a beach.
"So much for the case!"
Not every item has a numerical value... some are marked with a *+.
Your mind grinds to a halt. All you can see
"What the *hell* is this?"
"This would help a lot."
With a ruthless efficiency the worker isal maps his actions and decides what to do. He won't be bullied.
By this time *everyone* has gone missing. It has not been a quiet night, the streets are not empty of  police officers. Still, with your feet
Why is my gut churning... (Try to stop it.)
"He has been on more than one occasion."
The woman is silent.
Oh yeah, please. They're not gonna *recruit* you into their ranks.
No, you don't. You're not very good at this -- all the time. You're the most *fixed* you've ever been, and you're not fixing it.
You've gotten into many shoes -- from petty thefts to outright murders -- but nothing like this
She doesn't want to admit it, but the fact remains: she was exploited, carried away by the deal she struck with the Paledriver.
What's he going on about? Could it be a side-investigation?
"What the fuck are you talking about, you can't take 'er, piggy!"' he's screaming into the void-horn.
Wait, the time has come to thine repentant lie! Go ahead, do your damned thing!
He does *not* look happy about it.
If there's one thing you know for certain, it's that you've *been*.
That *moment* is the product of his mortal coil, his agonizing hole, and the noxious vapour rising from his nostrils.
"Yeah, but first let me see the gun."
Oh god, not this again!
It's a sequence... make sense now. There's a picture, a title, a "story" in there somewhere...
There's a long pause. "Then we should head back. I've *always* headed back. Back to the village. My heart's not in it any more."
Cocaine? Oh, yes. Cocainum acts as a powerful antioxidant, but it also contains a dangerous alcohol called *mitragyn* -- a blend of grape and apricot flavouring. Which one do you want?
She tastes the change, then nods. "Sure. What do you want to know next?"
In his hand he's holding a brash new type of firearm: a heavily modified outcropping of barrel - the *Vesper del Hjelmdall* rifle.
The body melts away, you're cold again, and the song keeps on... Why does it keep on repeating itself?
A dropped cigarette butt lies on the floor of the hookah parlour. The carcass is limp and half-eaten, smouldering with an unpleasant aftertaste.
Your fingers move in rhythmic, inexpressibly slow patterns across the sand. The beats remain in constant, imperfection. You shudder.
The skeleton comes to life, complete with six pairs of articulated lower legs and a hoof-like tongue, like the mouth of a cobra.
The gaunt man stares at you, still amazed at the fly's technicality. "I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about..."
To be honest: you have little to no idea. You don't know if it's true, you don't know if it's *boring* -- there's something here for later, if you just look.
The bottle is cold to the touch. In the shelf behind the mattress, a funky perfume awaits: Un pât à l'oignon? Un pât à vieilles?
Strip search.
"We've been through this. At some point, you've always wanted to dance. You've always wanted to go to *disco* parties."
Do you need the assistance of private security services?
There are roads in the world that go deeper than you can imagine. The world is too irrational, too mad.
You should ask her about the mask, see if she has something useful to share.
is missing. See, the <|startofline|> is just for show! Say something, show them what you can do!
"No one's."
She looks at the body's tent, then at you. "You mean you heard about his strange sleeping arrangements? I know you did. Anyway..."
She quickly scans her surroundings. "Yes, of course. And I should probably go get it, too. *Closer* means nicer. Oh, and outside? No one's watching -- except you. You're a pro in the end. No one wants a drunk who *doesn't*..."
Cuno kisses the boot. "The boots were my *only* possession upon which to drape the body in [the most patriotic of stances]. You may wish to return them to their former owner."
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror as the other, a middle-aged man, pulls the trigger of his gun. The young woman screams, two words are left unfinished: "Please, god..."
That's absolutely the correct form to greet your visitors. It is also, without a doubt, the most *ominous* entrance you've ever seen.
"I want to *paint*."
It must have been during the Islet Deluge that the pirate LUMINOUS AMONG THOSE SHOTS -- LUMINOUS AMONG THOSE SHOTS! -- ARCADE FALN NAMBY-
You should have wept into your hands when you got the chance. You didn't like holding your hand. It was anger.
Incorrect. They were part of the contraband squadron, heh heh heh... When not in use they flew about in a fixed formation, usually forming short-range, low-altitude passes over residential areas.
No. Maybe it's because you look like an Inuit. And your face is so different. Even among the Inuit -- you're a total badass.
At first glance, the controls seem to be routed through some kind of special gear box. But what you're looking for is a worm-like worm, not a regular pedal steel-like structure.
While the Major's spirit may rest in the dark, her *good* half lies in a strange land of sorrow and pain.
They're not all *bad*. There's only one way to find out who the ringleader of a massive drug ring is, and it's to ask her!
"I knew it. He's a joke of
It's no wonder you did it -- you're a perfect example of a replicant. A paradoxical... alien species.
Something in you wants to immediately *forget* about this. As if there was a gun somewhere nearby...
"See that side you've got, man, Cuno!"
I want to get off now.
He's just too hard on himself.
He sighs. "But I *still* have to complete my mandatory self-examination this morning, so I don't have time to devote to it..."
The apartment numbers have fallen off the door, leaving the panel with a satisfying *click* as the door slides shut behind you.
Even though you're not sure, it's probably best to state things like that. You may still come across it later...
There is a lot of talk in the command room right now. About the wingman, about the pétanque, about the wingman regaining control. You're one of the many to watch over the reign of law and order for the revolution!
There was plenty of room for error here -- and no reason to be suspicious.
Of course! Talent is fluid and flexible, but never lose sight of the fact that you are a cop, not a novelist.
"Okay, let's walk away and *die*."
It's unclear what the *conceivable* is, but the faintest trace of *clarity* seems to have passed through him.
The lieutenant lets out a glorious whistle, as though you'd given him permission to do so.
The once-bright mural towers in the distance; you see the faded name "Stardust" written on its wall.
Suddenly, your finger moves on the interactive reading surface. It seems to be working as intended -- at least you seem to have a little focus when you're not looking at it.
With a loud thud you hear the boardroom door open...
Pretty cool, huh? Keep it that way. I don't want the kid getting a head start on the stuff down in Martinaise.
The man doesn't say anything either. In a curiously detached voice, he settles into a raspy singing voice.
It *is* about a seagull.
He's sick of explaining
"Did he have an army?" The lieutenant is straight-ass and doesn't waver in his conviction.
"I can't let you do that," she hisses.
Ask for Kim.
There are some who would call it *arrogance* -- arrogance, if you will. An intellectual conceit, born of arrogance.
"Mr. Du Bois..." The man puts his hand on the gun, looking at the empty frame.
He laughs. "Not yet. I like to *look* at him on the cheeks of some wild geese -- that's all I'll say about that."
She was so busy she didn't notice you staring at her she actually missed you coming in
"Don't you worry, lieutenant. We're here and we're going to keep going until the wickedness abounds."
The minuscule amount of cocaine found in his system. Would he be interested in more *scientific* explanation?
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here. There are variables that aren't accounted for, and who knows what happens between now and then
A drug den of a king.
"What's the deal with the cops?"
"You had the little wagon-man."
Wait, what? You're blind, right?
All it takes is one more beer to make him lose all hope. It's over.
We're not off to a good start. You've been to his apartment only three times, and he only backs down after getting *thousands* of solid punches thrown at him. That's not a record for a detective.
"It's pretty much *us*, buddy."
"I'm not suggesting I have. If I were, I wouldn't have taken off my boots."
It's described as a *gun*. Doesn't mean anything either way.
While the newspapers are being tossed away, an agitated man-child is ripping up Shillings and Bottles, smashing windows in. More than an armament, this kid's eyes are fire.
The remains of a camp onsen, long since abandoned. There are no more tents at the end of the hallway.
"Marianne LePlante..." He looks to her suspiciously.
The (unspecified) *exciting* tickets are yellowed in red and offer glimpses into the (unspecified) *Superstar level*. They're sold out.
The lieutenant watches you in silence as you carry the unconscious trunk back to the trailer.
Gosh, how did *not* kill him? But then it was a *security guard*...
You're absolutely beat. I'm amazed you're still alive!
And it makes *disco music*. The death of disco music.
In the wild redoubt on Assisi. In the early hours of the morning, when the land is quiet and the air is thick with industrial smoke.
She watches you do the Pierre... for a bit. Then she stands and looks down at her hands.
But that would mean...
It's much easier to just not think about it.
All you hear is *the lamentation of a seagull*, the wistful crowing of an already-deceased bird or the sad wail of a woman no longer here to see her former self...
"I was brought up poor, my parents were poor. I was brought up in a low-income neighbourhood. Every day was either working in the fields or waiting tables..."
I'm guessing that's not the female form of the phasmid. The one you saw is called *that one*.
Nod numbly.
The door has seen better days -- the layer of paint has started to peel off due to the salt and wind from the sea. Even the lock looks slightly rusted.
Maybe you were too trusting, Harry.
You had your chance -- but you didn't take it. Instead you put your hand in the deep freeze, and now he's smiling at you.
The footprints in the traffic mud are joined by the hand of the b.savory one. A dead man walking around. You should have a look.
"Trying to make a connection that goes against everything I know. But it's a part of the job, I guess."
"How do you even know all this?
The one
Sorry. I didn't mean to cheer you up, I was just trying to get your side of the story straight.
Beneath the shell you see a mass of intricate torsos and Iilmaraan phasmidans dance atop two huge screens. A man turns on the side and looks at the waterline with a look of utter grief on his face...
You're super lucid. You can't think of a single thing that could drive you crazy. Just sleep, your eyelids are closed.
Homemade. As in, someone has used his presence to their own ends. He could not and would not stay silent about it.
"What if it's just hopeless?"
A view of the roof of the Whirling-in-Rags.
His eyes, the light of hope, are behind him, watching over all the world the calm before the storm.
The wide grin of the lieutenant's face proves it. The solid line under his eyes.
You should have a look at those footprints.
Whoa, she's s-s-sorry-ing? You were in awe. Then all of a sudden it dawns on you: she's sorry she didn't get this far.
You stare at the rectangle of plastic on the corner. Around it are several imprints: "Hjelmdallermann: Slaver in Pyx." "Hjelmdallermann: The Man from Hjelmdall and the Lorryman," reads another.
"You need to keep the company name 'Pretty Boy' if you want to remain mobile."
Indeed. Your forgery looks nothing like the document you found. As such, it's probably not worth the effort to try and sort it out.
Okay, maybe it *is* a little sad, but the grief-stricken shrieks have worn thin hiss alone, wafting through the deeps of the ocean, by which he means all the way to Jamrock, across the river in the unreal world -- into which he had intended to send the ship!
"No -- maybe... maybe you should have *me*?"
"Hey, do you know who I am? Am I God?"
"Okay, one down, three to go..."
The fact that she studied with you *illustrates* the fact that -- although she was not insane -- she's onto something. *Look at that smile on her face -- she's so *enjoyable*...
"...a *spooky* place."
Yup. That's the good stuff. The calm before the storm.
"He's not going to have a chance to find his own *ide
Another false alarm. No more false alarms. Just flat out darkness.
Puffy blanket.
The mother of humanism stands above you -- a precious, complex wax painting on a single pain of glass.
Damn, this is turning into some kind of mega-puzzle.
Behold!
Gone. Gone is the glory. Of hope, only the scribblings of miserable artists remain. Minor details of life -- the same sky, the same clouds, the same world.
"Yeah, he's *ancient*. He also said we'd find his lost gun. Which, by the way, he's going to do now."
Everything you pick out seems faded, chipped, and sad somehow. Most of them are  barely recognisable
I am confused. All this talking about *that one time* somehow makes me look bad. What *way* should I take?
Did he just *wink* at you? Perhaps something to consider when negotiating.
A really dumb thing to suggest to a kid. Anyway, you don't even have to be a Proto-Drugger to do this. You could be Maxime Flamenco right now!
I knew it. I know it. You and I are destined to be together -- somewhere. But you have to find out who *really* takes the glove first.
"You know, I have *some* questions about it."
You will never be able to experience it, he's afraid. People have died, and the thought occurs to him...
This guy's very good with disguises. A bit *too* garrulous, but still -- he's fooled you at first glance.
Kim's bluff.
She has a direct view to the backyard. Across the road, on a hillside two piggies stand with hounds, their collars visible through the reeds.
He shrugs. "Well, the small talk doesn't really help so..." He raises his eyes abruptly...
"Geez, thanks,
The ticket stubs are peppered with the vendor's name, along with his phone number and the year and the vehicle code.
The tzaraath is an ancient pastoral death-sign for those without mercy. It shows up naturally in those in its territory.
"I can't say I'm glad to hear that. The building is getting pretty *uninhabitable*."
She sighs. "I guess it's a *thing*. Or maybe just a... curse."
On second glance, second guess your "gun" reflex. What if you accidentally pull the trigger and your hand isn't there to grab it?
There is no news here. Only silence and the thought of vanishing sounds.
Distrust *the habit*. It's bad for your mental health.
"You're not from the homo army, you're from the administration building."
Blam! Straight in the eye. That's right -- bounce right on through her little tearjerker rage.
"I'm pretty sure you're good now, Harry." He nods. "Let's do this."
You pause.
The chains are cold, the iron cold of a lifetime ago.
Your nervous system could use a boost.
Not *all* that long ago -- when she and Deneuve were just starting out in their balloon race.
(Lean in closer.) "Hello, officer. Nice to meet you. What can I do for you, Harry?"
I *always* trust my inner racist. He says things like *it's okay*, *please don't worry*, and so on. But...
"Now, let's take a trip down memory lane, shall we?"
Hey, so you can use the van that Rodney hired you to hack into? So you can leave *the poles* alone, in the ocean? And just go straight in? Great choice.
For a moment you cease to hear the pop and her laugh, replaced by the dull, distant yelp of air being carried.
Sitting at a desk, Lieutenant Double-Yefreitor Goodenbach taps on the side of his notebook. "Let's review. This was June 21st -- almost a week ago. You can't be working on the case as a *matter* now. It's too late -- there's no other case to solve."
Across the room, the heating system hums its soft lullaby. Now that you're alone in the cold, long since gone.
"The name you guys call yourself?"
Wait, why are you even still reading this garbage? You know this garbage will yield no information
She doesn't *like* him. She's afraid.
The toilet paper is wet from the wind and the water in your mind is letting out a little bit more.
This is an opportunity to teach *them* a lesson. Demonstrate your worth as a law-enforcement official by pulling the trigger on your gun.
Good decision. You're ready to *get* those shivers under your control.
"I don't know... I don't even know your name. You're not a *real* cop."
"Seems like a lot of people do."
Don't worry, all is not lost. You can still become an all-around good cop. Take up the baton!
"...is *not* how great American diplomacy works." The lieutenant nods. "But, fine, here's the crazy part. Krenel has been paying us three nights a week *for* three months straight. That's *not* three years. That's *less than* two years'."
If the jacket had an editorial line, it would be... confusing.
And your ruined leg, too. For standing there all these years. For years. Even though you know it's *not* your leg.
A sudden flash of fury. He's about to lash out at you.
"Good catch, you two. What else can we talk about?"
He looks across the room. "Maybe we should call it a day. This is a children's play. Let's close it with a bang."
"Sorry, but I don't have
"What if I want to solve a murder now? I need to be *proved* guilty -- by someone. Once I've been *guilty*."
"Are you a Mass murderer?"
Blam!
"Oh no, cop-man..." His eyes are large and round. His hair is
"Kras Mazov was me. Mazov was a *psycho* who fucked his brains out. I was on the radio when he died."
"Yeah, he had a bone to pick with us."
"I don't know -- it's always been a little too hard core for me..."
Everything! The case files, the interrogation notes, the made up stories, the imaginary friends you've formed... It's all there is...
You remember that time you went down to the boardwalk and asked if she was...
Another pair of boots! You should search the crime scene again.
Wanna hear what's dumb? Some dudes in some apartments upstairs smoking dope. Ooh, cocaine-kid, you should taste some.
Wouldn't they have to pay you again?
In retrospect, it might have been a good idea to go for the gun rather than the bottle. There's a .38 caliber bullet in there.
"How do you know? If you didn't *know* what I was doing? That's it -- it's *entirely* on you."
For heaven's sake, he thinks -- if it *were* about her, then maybe you should stop trying to kiss her and go straight to the police...
Good choice. You got it.
"I hope you are not judging me for asking these questions. It's too dangerous to ask them, especially in a crowd of like-minded individuals."
Look,
Suicide Cop? You know what this does -- it makes you *more* sticky, doesn't it? This *demonstrates* the point?
You need to be more *specific* in your description. Some examples... Q: Is this joke gone now? A: It probably was.
Yes, it seems to me the most beautiful thing is in the rain.
In some places it feels as though you could *taste* the sandwich. With a bit of butter
Although he *was* corrupt, that is probably it -- he was about to make a bunch of money. Nothing you can do about it.
"Yeah, about that, I'm not from around."
Lies. And sodden gossip. The former *king* of town, now a disgraced prisoner of *last* conviction.
The black shoes look dry and uncomfortable in your hands.
It's impossible not to notice the modified fire brigade's brand of realism.
I know! I know! Everything is so calm now, you should go have a ciggy before this gets too crazy.
Is her husband missing?
Her shoulders do not shake. Her light voice does not escape her long-dead form.
"We still have to perform a field autopsy on the victim. We need to know what the cause of death is."
Yes. Wait 'til you see the one with the chick in it, it's gonna be a good one. You feel even worse this morning than you did last night.
"Could you go into the house a little bit more quietly?"
The tangled web of paper continues in the man's hand, although it's starting to look like he actively sought out the opportunity to move on.
"Is this a good joke?" The lieutenant shakes his head.
He puts his hand in the emptiness.
He really does.
"That doesn't sound like me at all."
It comes free with the early season one-month trial subscription. To prove yourself -- and get to the A-OK world -- buy the full version today!
A machine stands in the corner, watching over all the world -- a maze of supply crates, ready to be filled with *anything*, of course.
Stomach gasps for air, you think -- because what could this delicious mess in your stomach with a bad conscience possibly offer?
Of course. 'Sides' is where the similarities end. Her - his school, her connections, her location...
The man stands in a pitted street grid. Almost all of the houses have been damaged, but one stands out conspicuously: The very large 'Oranje' residence.
You never had a chance. There was something off the moment you approached her... she scoffs.
"Suit yourself, officer, but *this* is not going to be an amicable exchange. I'm going to need your gun, Mr. Dros."
The deputy nods approvingly. "And you've *shown* him the barrel before -- that's better than nothing."
Invisible to you -- and to those around her -- two small metal capsules are nestled in the wood
"A real killer is bound to have at least one partner."
You look at the broken robot and see what you can see: a memory-landscape full of candor, not unlike the one inside your head.
No. There is nothing wrong with you. If anything, you should concentrate on how well you're able to remember that you've done it.
I'm not. I'm really not.
The chaincutters slip out of your hand. Into the thick damp grass below -- their fat fingers dangle
WOW... that's awesome.
This man is letting his hair down. Let him finish this interrogation, then he'll have it coming.
With the door open, the dial switch ---- this time off ---- while the dial switch itself is barely audible, you make it through the silence.
"Good morning, comrade! Yeaaaaaah!" The rooster gives you a piercing crowing
"I'm too bad to feel it."
"Look, I'm going to throw you under the wagon over this. You don't have to answer any more. I'm not a... *ninth* Hardie boy."
Two cops, a loose end -- the case becomes suspicious after a while. The signs of a sad, *trapped* detective begin to appear.
A small, terrified smile quivers on her face as she takes the sandwich from you and grins. "Don't be silly for doubting me. There are worse things in the world than being called a *false* nine times out of ten."
He squints. "That's her again. She always tries to lure people into her trap, and now she's *done* it -- it's a *phenomenal* bounce."
"They're awesome."
The lieutenant is lying. He's so focused on the heat that he doesn't take note of your remark.
"The *Sewage City* was in the process of being converted into a sewage treatment plant." She looks at the water-stained walls.
All you hear is static, picked up by the modem.
"Except my mate. I have more
"Seems okay. Let's move on, however."
Maybe?
Not that he needed our encouragement. The man is more on edge than usual.
You do realize you have to balance your thumb on the keyboard before you can fire up the RAC instrument, right?
"Please... please just... just..."
"Okay, this is it. This is where you leave all the *lab rats*, Kim. But we're only looking at it."
It's like an index -- but for *terrible* letters. Grim, pathetic letters. Roaring bull-dogs, throwing tantrums and generally being unruly.
"We're talking about the police..." The lieutenant says quickly, his eyes welling up with tears.
Not right now. [Leave.]
The lieutenant sighs. "Doesn't sound like it's going to happen any time soon."
What is sad is when something familiar feels like a *threat* to your sense of self. You may have *some* control over the phasmid, but you're not in the shapelier's hands.
It is possible that it was a *false* alarm -- built to look like a false alarm, anyway. The number of false alarms is a product of human tendency towards sameness and separateness, and of the illusion of total, continuous alarm.
"Now get in that chunky one and *fucking* let's move on. I don't care what she thinks of you, but she *has* to know the bullet has landed."
Look, the place has changed hands many times over -- there's a small museum that's kept it tidy
"I'm too old for street fighting," the lieutenant says, seriously contemplating putting his hand on your shoulder.
He thinks he's a badass for having the boots on -- the guns are a threat to *everyone else's* health. The question is, do you have any questions before we fire up the Big Communism Builder, or do we get *this* done?
A carabiner, a mate. A 4.46 calibre bullet.
Your word here has yet to be strictly adhered to. It's best to act pre-operational.
The lead programmer strides offstage. "There are drugs being sold here. This is all for show. Sell me what you got, Redcoat."
If it weren't for the *Two Musketeers* robbing banks on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine, a branch of De Beers would have been open, providing the paper to sign.
He's capable of anything. This crew must be weakened.
Not now. Not after *this* man.
The sparkle of her eyes means she's not too worried about your health. "Kim, are you a freak? I feel so much better about you..."
"I've got someone to do." [Throw away the tape.]
It's a *belittlement*.
Look, *bratan*! You're going to need to conduct a thorough search of this building once he's gone.
She looks at the smoke rise to her lips. It's almost an expression.
"I would like to buy the 'Noid', Kim."
did you hear? He's about to say something! He said he heard you speak to the girl at the church.
"So you've *done* more than you let on."
"It's not really *about* being a cop," the lieutenant answers for the three of us.
All kinds of *crazy* things happen when drugs are involved... sweet, sweet drugs, produced by evocative apparitions.
Tackling alcohol use is a noble pursuit. Don't you feel it?
On a personal level, she's holding her part of the draw against some sort of terrible fate. It's making her feel like a *pagan* to death.
"The air is thick with sweat. The wind blows. People wear dark hats on this cold day. I ask no questions. I'm asleep."
A fear that he made up.
He winces. "What did she say?"
A thick layer of coal dust covers one side of the furnace. The room behind it is empty, save for a vacuum cleaner hanging on the wall.
They are tearing up your relatives and friends -- in this world.
"It was a guess," she replies.
The suit of armour adorning your skin is probably the only thing keeping you together now. The strands of hair look like patterns on a seagull.
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You don't even notice them... you don't *want* to stop.
She laughs out loud. "Can't call it a day, <player>!"
All right! Final exam -- time to find the *perfect* medium. Now that you've selected the medium, is it? Perhaps you should return to it after you've finished your field trip? Fields on a field of hallucinogenic mushrooms.
A pivot point in the cyclical dance music soundtrack...
"I would *fuck* you."
All you hear is anguish. The voice of someone who's been waiting, wailing, on the wind-stricken coast.
(Try to fold it) "Yes, okay."
Lamentation? But you know you do not have the full log. And, at least in this one case, you *may* have the full log. So...
I'm sure we will find a use for them once we find him.
The lieutenant nods toward the man sitting on the log, then checks his notes. "I've heard that before -- and it usually is a good idea to wait for the end of the act -- the police captain usually pronounces death before speaking of missing persons."
Ignore the posters. The meat is cold and tasty.
His neck is relaxed, the muscles of his neck relaxed too. Just the light tingling in his skull. You can hear the sleep sputter.
A small jewel of flesh is still visible through the systems explorer's goggles. It is ring-shaped and slightly moist from the air.
While the wind ruffles her hair, the fat land snail observes you, then her smiling face disappears between the wire...
"I haven't really used them much. They just get in the way so much. But I have something else I need to talk about."
You glance over the water -- at the decaying hydroelectric dams, lifeless geologists and, most disturbingly, the still very much inlaid oil slick on the coast.
"I'm sorry to question you about these shit-lickers. You're not the Firewalker."
Not only that -- but you found out they made almost no money.
All you see is your pretty face in the pic -- everything else is black. Your name is attached to every letter. This, his most beautiful creation.
"Hello, Mr. Claire." Her voice is sharp and sharp. "Do you know what's up with the cop shop around here?"
Did I lose *one* jacket?
"Fine. It's not a problem." She pats the ground.
Though he was high on phenothiazine, he's not exactly sure where that came from.
"Kim, I've just *discovered* you're gay."
Could it be a symptom of overdosing on something? Something even you have not tired? Keep trying!
The sofa is immobile. A thousand miles from home, where he has never been.
After several turns you have a neat pile of cardboard coins and a small die worth of ornate chewing gum.
A run down the coast canals with wide, flat land snaking outwards to the the bay. Drawn by the occasional tidal wave, rubbish-streets and cornices. Along the way, old cul-de-sacs and rail car yards litter the landscape...
Boots with Rotting Flesh
The smell of sweat and glue, the floorboards peeling. There's a locker in the corner and a worn pair of pants inside a crack in the wall...
It's a marvel your brain continues to function at all, human. You're a better man now. With a name. A *reality* actor.
Wait -- isn't this a dangerous path?
Indeed it is, the scruffy-haired little shit turns double from the memory's guilt. Three figures in suits and ties stand in front of a box of chitin. The one with the large head is pointing at you with an unreadable expression.
"Let's go." [Leave.]
Than god, the kid is getting on your bad side now! Why did you let him get away with it? Fine, we'll overlook that.
I need to go. [Leave.]
"It's not, officer." The man immediately behind the fence takes the tape and turns it down. "It's made from acid."
"Rats of Lizzie, rats of torment. But you won't." The old woman looks at the petrifying cryptid, then at you. "You've been through this. My reason for not letting you inside is that you're so frightful."
"The story I'm about to tell you is... it's a very simple story. There's a dead body on the island. It's cold out. I need to get him down there."
Someone has left a banner at the bottom of the screen, asking you to find the buried gun. It reads: "Where's Your Empire's Best?"
The document is signed by the Coalition's illegitimate ruler, Johanna Islet (Jioux-les-Cours), plus one other unnamed official.
Likely an accident waiting to happen.
"So now I have the most boring head scar I've ever seen."
A gush of wind disintegrates another small piece of the board, revealing more plastic... Glowing red triangles, tiny rectangles of paper crack as the strange phasmid devour them.
Like a cruel, calculated joke, it leaves you holding the popular one: "Go ahead, there's plenty to talk about." You know
"A service crate."
Correct. The Distiller's Diary is a transfixing chronicle of Wirrâl's youth. A serial killer? A *club* shooter? It's impossible to tell from this point of view -- the helmsman has gone
"*Insane*." He shakes his head. "Houses of worship that have never hosted a significant number of musical
Maybe it's okay if you don't make it *today*? The phasmid's always okay with you being the bad cop.
Look inside the fridge.
I'm guessing he's scared.
I *am* a riot.
His wife was once engaged in a -nomadic- dance troubadour. They have a three-thousand-dollar cheque in the bank.
"I've kept the tip, miss. It was not a good cut."
Your heart beats.
The old woman still smiles her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass window.
"I remember all those times I wished someone was watching me when I was fucking the floor. I mean *I guess* I'm a bit suspicious, isn't it? I wish I was *someone* or something... I wish I had a gun..."
He was *just* about to head home. Across the road -- across the river in Central Jamrock -- when he heard the news of the rally.
It's old, the numbers have worn off the thick rubber mask of the headrest. There is an old photo of her with poor lighting, in a light-filled room on the fourth floor of the Whirling-in-Rags. It's you.
*No* idea what it is. It's just something you've been craving, what is this... way more than you barg
She has absolutely no idea about this.
Hang on, you need the booze -- you *need* it to concentrate better!
You see the lieutenant's eyes welling up with rage and brimstone at the same time. It's clear he does not approve of your handling of the corpse.
Oh god, the jacket! Please, someone is making a note!
"No, I'm *not* gonna fucking ask that about how many joints you have."
The old man starts laughing. "Are you kidding? You need those types of drugs for god knows what reason."
Suddenly, out
Pull on the left boot.
How could he have run so fast?
"Officer, why don't you and me go and have a little talk in your room? We'll take care of this shit for you. We'll take care of *everything*. You don't even have to pay us. We'll give you the keys to the building."
"That she doesn't feel comfortable enough in her own home -- and that she's going to tell the Fire
On the stairwell behind the door -- a freshly painted mural. Feral dogs bark at night. In the hall outside the fenced-in yard, a grey body part lies in a heap: a black plastic disk with an oddly-shaped "TRUE" gluing over its middle.
"It's a shame the story doesn't have more punch. Otherwise, this whole incident could have been far more dramatic."
"I'm sorry it was all so sudden. I don't blame you. There are so many of them. The police officers just get up there and scream, too -- the people have to just *listen* to them now..."
Gemini hasn't had time to rest lately.
Saying these piggies and groves about morality are "old isometric" doesn't really go for him.
"Except I had to call you, I think. I think the company is still trying to make you feel important and I think they're trying to get as much out of you as they can."
In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, a middle-class residential neighborhood, between the Boogie Street viaduct and the canal. Snow falls on the roofs of buildings. And on the plaza where a statue of Filippe the III stares down at the traffic jam.
It feels pretty good. Not great.
As you probably already know, the Revachol Special Administrative Region ( Wompty-Dompty-Dom Centre ) is home to some of humanity's most exotic and controversial political prisoners.
Be sure to leave all critical faculties behind and leave no one else to question your hunches.
All you see is an intrusion of late-stage alcoholic straws. What *does* it *meant*? You've tried, tried and tried again!
Look, he's a moribund alcoholic whose annoying ways have made him lose his job and his friends.
If anything, it sounds a bit *confusingly*. Like you're hearing words again. But it's impossible to really make out what they are.
Dazzling! The //connection* was made in her head! You can feel it, the //unison* of roman numerals!
A dozen pages later and it's still all gibberish. No one understands what you're trying to get at here.
You know it in your lungs where the pressure should vibrate, in your heart that's alone... Where it shouldn't.
"So, the fuck are you going to do now?"
"I can't say, officer. I don't even know how many have *lets' talk about* it..." The lieutenant stares at you, mouth open. "I'm sorry, but I'm just not getting the story here..."
Just like that. The first rum-booster in Revachol. There's a touch of amphetamine in the salty air, before it dissipates into the tongue.
"Not just any old discarded shit, 'yuppie shit'. Take a look at this shit." He gestures with his beer can with
One of the most popular and controversial tracks is *The Pox*, especially among thrill-seekers. There's no denying it now -- the "Stairway to Heaven" part was the most popular.
The weight is all your, he's pulling down on the force as he squats, angling his torso to get the most out of the jump. You should concentrate on the threat.
"I'm still waiting for you to tell me if you know *anything* about that, do you miss?"
You aren't imagining it. He wouldn't do something like that.
He's learned his lesson.
A leader like Titus is bound to have some issues to address, but you have his ear on all these. Who's the most recent of these?
She doesn't reply, her eyes swallowed up by her hands. You've put all of this extra thought into making her sad...
Even if she didn't record it, you shouldn't. You've just about earned a drink right here. Or a cig. Or both.
The man stares at the sky, then the tracks, then breathes out sharply: "I was in Königstein, near the Whirling-In-Rags with a group of drunks and degenerates. We had come so far. Yet here I am, staring into this abyss once again."
"We just found the victim's boots. We can't get the victim's pants, can we?"
This could easily turn into some goofy discussion about *games*. But you're the hero.
The old guy, by the way, looks absolutely *cute*.
"I told you not to ask about the hanging, officer. It's not relevant."
No, not *too* surprised, this is one of those rare situations where you just need to be sure you're talking to *the real* guy.
All you see is yourself. Unclear, for all intents and purposes, waist-length hair sticks to your head, obscured by stub
"They're quite absurd, but I'm willing to let you have some privacy on this matter."
"Actually, let's talk about something else."
The knife is still warm from her touch, and still blurring in her hands.
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see the reflection of your face in it -- including your nose, which has completely failed you...
If you had to guess -- who would you think would be prettier?
A *little* is clear that Sunday afternoon, a little over a week after the murder. You take Sunday off, and Monday morning rolls around with no breakfast. Still no word from Sunday either.
The fork moves with admirable smoothness, mouthing the words *ka-pow* under your eyelids. The stomach kind of hurts...
The tornadoes you saw on the picture-drawing board are gone, but for a small brush stroke on the bruise -- *Bien*.
Ahem. That's kind of you
"Alright." He turns to the lieutenant. "See you in seven days. Since then -- I've had enough fun just now."
Those arches acted as support for something higher up -- the trap. Perhaps you can peek inside.
Do you? You betcha!
This doesn't look like a child, it looks like the lazy and aimless teenager lying on the floor. You are at once surprised and sad to see it. The door has been left ajar, but no sign of life in the affected side.
Of course. When your century-old rival runs out of gold, silver, and Iilmaraan jolly-golem heads, it's always a good idea to run.
Think you can *handle* this? The prob'ly not real part, leave that to the imagination.
Hold up, is he allowed to anonymously perch on that crane? Isn't that his job to be paranoid?
"Just kidding. I was
Titus gives you a quick
Somewhere in there a baby or a small child is crying.
BOTH of you must be the responsible party for this unprofessional conduct.
"Theory is dangerous, friend, but in the meanwhile, yes, it *is* possible."
All those cold water -- all those thoughts -- running through your head. Running through your whole being. Even through you just yelled at the window.
The only boots you found were brownish-coloured boots. They're probably wearing them just now, on account of the stench.
Some thoughts just won't die. They just keep coming back to you. Try more!
I don't know... but he makes you feel like a zemlyaki. Like a *funk star*.
You seem to have a slight physical imbalance in the hands, maybe you're super- or something? You really need to look into these bruises.
No, I'm scared.
Then you will feel *true*. Fear, for now -- this is the feeling you've been craving.
"Piss off, Lely!" (Pick up the stick.)
"Kim, she's asking about our *relationship*."
The choice is yours.
A memory surfaces in her interrupted vision. It's not a bad idea to *even* entertain the thought.
An old mirror hangs on the wall, half-covered in shadows. You see your face, such as it is without *The Expression*. It's ugly -- but that's the beauty of *The Expression*.
A theory like that draws you in with its woozy logic, but it's just not compelling enough to stick with in court. You might want to rethink the whole "How come there's a drug lord in a lady driver's cabin?" thing.
Try the 'Workshop Spare' key on the door.
Satellite-Officer FALN! You swear you feel the familiar metallic taste of ramen noodles.
Do you even have one?
She saw them getting into the act.
"No," the lieutenant finally speaks, his voice breaking. "I don't think so."
They're safe and sound here. No wolves prowl. The bay is open.
Of course, not everyone finds it in their heads. And if they do, you can always do *another* thing. Maybe a no-no?
"The Protocols of the Resistance -- I know this is only part of it."
"What?" He straightens his back. "Tell him, officer, but do not say anything. Or else I'll..."
The beating heart, the source of great sorrows and despair, is not the real reason she's so worried... sweet brother, you're dear to her, as you should be.
I guess it's going to be difficult for a while. I mean, you can't even remember the *name* of the person you are right now, can you?
"This party has been my life since I found it in the Whirling's trash. It's been the life of my party-horse 'Le Pécro' ever since."
Put 10 cents in and dial a random number: 001 -- 89 -- 11 -- 17 -- 21 -- 32 -- 51 -- 12 -- 3B -- +11 -- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He nods. "Well, the third one is... a... L'origine du fourth, a L'origine du fifth... L'origine du eleventh... L'origine du thirteenth... L'origine du fourteenth... L'origine du fifteenth... This is Jean-Luc Picard of the Relay Philippe's 'Transport' family. He's been charged with certain crimes but has yet
No no no no... That's not how a glib ass is
"So... do you think the possible location of the missing eighth Hardie girl has been ruled out..."
What you *discover*? Well, it will *still* take more than one look, but you should take it. From here on out, it's AMAZING.
The password. The one you came up with. Almost no one uses it any more. Probably because they realized it was unworkable. And dumb.
He nods. "Try it again, *bratan*. I'll give you another chance, after you've proven yourself."
—the more communist books you read the more communist your brain becomes. That's how communism works.
You should have kept your eye on this *one* guy. You could have followed up on the leads. Instead you took the *leasho* and *leopardize* yourself.
This is the Red Light District, a ghost street grid made manifest in the form of yellow lines extending outwards from the core.
"I'm a negotiator -- I'm what they call an expert at *economic arrangement*."
As you turn, a geniality suddenly comes over you: smiles, nodding heads, and occasional passing motorists staring at you with beady eyes.
"Of course I am." She looks over the bay. "What can I help you with then?"
I like to imagine myself kneeling in the icy courtyard, grasping a bit of snow with my snow-flecked fingers.
"One of the heroes of the revolution was an Oranjese named Prudence Krenel. He was sent to guard a convoy transporting arms to a client of the then-vachol-based munitions manufacturer..."
"I have no idea, man. What she saw in me, she did not feel in any other way. She was very young, very innocent, and took very little pleasure from me when I failed her, as I often did."
So worth it.
Something tells you you should really check that sock. You feel like it *might* have something to do with the corpse thing...
Huge! It's intimidating.
"What can I say
What did this to *you*?!
Oh yeah! Violence, hot passion and dismemberment fantasies. Filled to the brim with jealousy and rage.
What about those spooky basement doors? You feel like you should have *some* questions first, after all.
Could it be the source of *The Expression* that blind-sided Evrart?
No. She really hasn't had the time to think about it. If she says it's *interesting* then it's probably not true.
What is the hangover?
"No. I'm not a sexist."
"He's telling us about some girl in the tent. But he's lying. There's something *weird* about him."
What? It's impossible.
"I'm not so sure," he agrees.
She doesn't answer, but her fingers gently touch the pendant as she turns to you.
The bed is quiet, save the sound of you looking at it.
"The Fat Albert
She *always* spies on you. A delicate little curveball on the girl's heart, shining in the end of her face like a burning needle.
A sigh. The lieutenant pulls his gun from the holster. "Sergeants, we've no business here. Let's just do it."
You have a bit of variety in your base from there. Mix and match to get a feel for what's in there.
"It's okay. I'm not a bad person. No one's perfect."
"But I said I had my own plan."
"Hey, Fred!" The blondette steps in and stands behind you.
Your head feels light and cold with the cold. You hear the empty trap and empty gun case slamming into the wood at your command.
Yes, it would be all too easy for a cop to convince a citizenry accustomed to male detachment.
The wall towers in the background -- shadows. You can hear the wind rustle the graffiti off the concrete -- letters, sketches, ideas. Letters, chunks of letters, heads of families, continents, the briefcase...
"I hope this has been *therapeutic*. This is going to hurt."
You see a cardboard cut-out of a chitin hat on a string. The box contains a sticker which has almost disappeared into the fray with the shuffling of sand and the wind.
"Yeah, Garte's good for that."
Why did Cuno go through so much trouble to get here? What was his secret motivation? Something *he* did? You can still ask him...
Fell into it.
The excitement is overwhelming. You feel like you're going to run out of tracks here...
The man shakes his head, still tormented by the past. "You should have seen his jaw when he accepted the jacket."
An endless variety of messages, all of which seem to have been written by hand, weigh heavily on her mind. What they want is to tell you something.
And while you're there, you should run across the road and see if there's anything in there for Filippe and his hash brownie fantasies.
"I don't really understand the dance, Kim. The lyrics
The motley assortment of paraphernalia abounds. Aside from the bottle, there's also the reel of tape you pulled from the pile -- a plastic disk, apparently unopened. Some kind of movie bonus?
The lieutenant's hands are cuffed behind his back and a cloth over his face. His gaze wanders down the corridor...
There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant stops his lap and looks up at the ceiling, nodding his head in anticipation...
*Gasp* *Vomitor* from the other book.
"But now --  do we have any *results*?"
You see light, rhythm, and strong chords. There are no stops.
To make matters worse, you feel like *you* should've gone down on Giuseppe to find some -- this was a *mistake* on your part!
"Titus, what's your opinion?"
"Wait. We really need to talk about my super weird signature."
"Yes, I'm sorry, but I really am, so no need for weird metaphors." She crosses her arms. "For now I'm just going to call you Miss Oranje Disco Dancer."
Warm blood pools on the kitchen counter tops. In the dark you see a single candle on the mouth of the stove.
Sooooo cool.
She feels guilty about drawing this line -- and so does the man before you. They share a common trauma, a common history.
Under the pink morning sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the rainswept horizon...
"If the communists are going to
I am afraid we cannot in good conscience let Ruby back in the wild. She's too intoxicating of a presence for that.
He sighs. "I hate to tell you this, but you don't have to. You can go on. Whatever you do, don't ask about *anything*. You have the gun."
"It could have been one of the hotties down there. The cafeteria manager or someone. All the girls told me to take off my pants. They said I'm too fat for them."
Your fist squeezes the cold metal like a sponge. The contact pin jerks. The metal hardens under your palm, hardens under your fist. You're hands are bathed in cold sweat. Then...
The gentleman rugs his pockets for warmth. "The loss was so sudden and unexpected. Even we
"The life you lead... The authority you place in those lives..." she finishes the sentence, reflecting. "I would describe myself as a liberal. We should try to be just as open and just as strong."
He points to the black bolt of the gun. "And this is our specialist in crime, lookout here. If you see anything suspicious, please let me know."
An ugly pickaxe, sent to break open the lid. The owner must have a soft spot for his former employees, if his words are to be trusted.
A pop quiz is a short examination designed to test your knowledge without any prior warning or announcement. Such exams allow the teacher to assess how thoroughly the students have retained the material at hand -- voila! Now blast that first innocence!
After you -- in the dark. Around the king. The hammering in your head has subsided, both physically and mentally.
The door has heard your karaoke performance and it wants to help you remember -- your room has been earmarked for this.
"We had to restore the hard disk."
The word lingers in the air of the shack, before the meter jacks the wind picks up again.
The chitin is an organic layer of wood chips that have fused together into a rope or rod. They usually range in colour from orange to red, though there's also a tiny headland of spit in the north coast.
No one even *put* those words in her mouth.
It *is* a little ironic that you're the one making it sound like you did it for
It's...uh...about a sea monster?
As the brash young man starts screaming, "OH MY GOD, SHUT UP!" the lieutenant steps in: "You've got this, you've got that..."
It's not easy, but you *do* it. Day in and day out, like a master fighter. You don't flinch, because you know you did the right thing.
The bottom of the sea is cold and empty. There is nothing there, only the shadows there, drawn to the empty tank.
As you turn to leave, the slight pining he feels towards you... a fleeting surge of fondness, somehow stirred up by the distillation of the ethanol. He doesn't want to say it...
You know the story by heart at this point. Some folklorists tell it in legends. You've read enough.
Bump it. Hard.
*There! There is no other way! You know how you'd be feelin' if you were standin' here right now!
But I'm not, sire.
No, that's not it. You're cool. Just stay cool. You're under control now, don't melt down.
He purses his lips. "Maybe it doesn't have to be like this. Maybe you're just good at evading detection."
Guess, you just gotta be persistent. Maybe if she's lying...
"Right now. I'd say this squad is the Royal Hounds of the Apocalypse."
"Well, it would have been very shocking had it not. The absolute *worst* kind. Yet here we are. A super-rich nation-state, encompassing nearly one-sixth of humanity. To say it more... it is irredeemable."
There was an old woman. A war-torn woman curled up into a ball on the floor of the shack. Huge chunks of her body have been exposed to the elements.
You did this because Evrart has her pinned as the ringleader of the pirates*. You can be damn sure he would *not* have let you near the corpse. You can't even smell it...
Don't say *anything*.
If you feel left out, you're not alone.
The paper still smells of linens. Snakes. A recent favorite among Air Canada flight attendants...
Under the wind you hear the deserter speak of how he came to be free, and the broken mirror -- before, during, and after he had his accident.
(Lower case, not in your head!)
Even better! You swear you felt it coming... the sound of the buckle snaps as the leather down checks out. You're ready for more glory!
Look, there's *one* problem...
"Wait, you don't want me to be the one to give you the money?"
The water continues to pour down your limp, making it harder and harder to stand. A small piece of fluttering flutters in the corner of the eye...
Very strange. Where did this come from? Why are you so opposed to it? He's just saying it as it is...
He doesn't look or sound heroic. Heroism has no place in your *inner circle* -- the innermost of bonds that form the *hard core* approach to game design.
Yeah. So anyway -- young man, in his twenties, found with his skull busted open. Right on the floor of the hookah parlour.
You must have sudden, horrible, unforeseeable vision. You will fail if you don't make this connection.
"LAW ENFORCEMENT?"
Interesting. If this Is New Sundance, then it is NOT the Jefferies truck that crashed into the boat, it's *Krenel* -- an allacronym for Low Frequency Equipment.
Wait, why didn't he just go into detail -- he has to give his name?
A cockatoo is a parrot with an erectile crest, found on the Semenine islands and in southern Face-à-la-Mer. Known for their intelligence and general precociousness, cockatoos are popular birds in aviculture; however, they often exhibit various behavioral issues.
"How much did it cost me?"
"It's sad to see a good person go, but it *
The lieutenant doesn't answer.
See, there it is -- your name! Your bum's not bad enough without a *man's* name... But you're too ashamed to ask this person for help, so here we are...
"This place is *corrupt*, Kim. It will *never* be the same again."
Only the pilot's log has survived the voyage, but a few pages are visible above the rest. It's clear that the meteorite accident remains a source of great sadness for the man.
With a *plop* your hand emerges from the mouth, covered in blood up to the wrist. Just how it is, all things considered.
"You're a spineless vessel, you know that? It's like you're dripping wet, *wet*..."
The number '10' has been written under the chart. It has been added as an *Omega* code. 10*XXX is the magic number for 2001.
Maybe it's? You *know* you want to fuck with her. *You* are a killer. You got that fresh stuff. Let's get that fresh stuff on her.
You feel small, vulnerable all of a sudden, as though someone are standing in front of you.
You hear the phone ringing in your room. It's a Lee, used to living on the road. A gold chain joins the end of his hand.
A healthy dose of *surprise* comes over you. A touch of... innocence?
You know the story by heart at this point. While Kim was afraid, you know what would happen?
Think there's a *reason* for that?!
WHAT IS THIS?
The cook looks at you, but before long he interjects: "You don't have to be a hero. We can still have fun without all this."
The man lets out an exasperated cough.
Do you know what's behind the door?
"Don't hold your breath, honey."
So you went to the naval school. So you could be a cop. And now you live in a commune, but you don't *feel* that way.
"To the whole Unionsburg, Pa."
What he means is: You're right, actually. All those geologists and paleographers. They *were* hired to create the reality we see in your head.
I got it.
"There is! This is my preferred method. The tape stays intact -- there is nothing left to add to it later."
Tear off the fake teeth.
Waves wash the sand. An old man in his early fifties stands under a collapsed carousel tree. In front of him is a collapsed roof. Two women sit on rickety boards in the rain. One of them has an apparatus in her hand. It's *extremely* important that you get this evidence, Major.
"So, can I just get the key now, like the real deal?"
"No." (Conclude.)
"Murderers." He turns to the village and adds: "It wasn't just the cops, it was us."
"Yeah. The art thing. I mean, look at those stars!"
"You don't have a..." He pauses
"Alright, dear. You had your *dreams*."
All right, so you don't *have* a logo. One that says "Pawn Stars Take Manhattan," maybe you could fix it?
Your hold is very stiff.
It's a simple matter of cause and effect. That's all you have, and *everyone* knows why it doesn
This is not going well, he's about to confess.
As you slam the board shut you feel a small surge of pride -- a pang of pride, like you just *wasted* a little power.
You know, on the coast of the Martinaise Inlet there are a few really oldies who enjoy the rough justice of the oldies -- they provide the *maintenance* and the *presence* of the dead. But those are few and far between...
The young man with sunglasses is under the influence right now. He turns the knob to your left -- to infinity.15...
Failing that, you might try looking at the keys again.
That much is true. Titus is familiar from high school. You feel this man's voice, even look at him.
The door has seen better days -- the satellite has joined your party. There's laughter in the room, power lines bangle like jaws around the TV...
You were cautious in the beginning, but now that you have them, it's *even* more so. The documents are *valid* now.
"Okay, you and Gaston -- I agree."
"You said earlier, 'A man's gotta work.' Well, a hard-of-core law enforcement officer works long hours. Even the Union doesn't have to. It's the long hours that pay off in hard currency."
"We could do it without the racket, though. Now all we need to do is find Victor and his tools. *And* we should talk
Admit it, you're beginning to wonder if the world is really flat. There's a reason you haven't been able to come up with a convincing argument for the existence of the barnacle people.
He adjusts his coat, wary of the cold.
For a moment the lieutenant seems to be unfazed by your ruckus. Then he interjects: "No, that's not *true*, sire."
"As long as the rights of the working man are in full force..."
Fuck. Fuuuuuck!
You learn about the International Collaboration, a private international police force responsible for interdiction and compliance for all major regulatory bodies in the Elites (except the Special Administrative Region, which is completely made up).
The gun has left your hand, still numb from the recoil. The lieutenant looks at the corpse's stomach with an unreadable expression.
Look at Kim AGAIN.
"Do you do drugs? Are you a dealer?"
On the islet?
But then it changed its mind and said it wasn't me. So
We could investigate these 'animals' and their 'copotypes' further, but we're not sure these things are necessary in court...
I won't be a creeper. (Opt in.)
You glance at the clock.
"Okay, man, so I'm a communist. But what do I do? I'm a cop."
"Fair enough. I need to ask something else."
In another life, the Man from Hjelmdall might be on his way to earth. You're turning your back to the stars and your fist is left on the gas pedal.
If you want to know more about her you should talk to her. But if you only ask him how he feels about things...
See -- your ex-Lambda pals couldn't stop talking about you! Best not to mention it, no one likes lying.
[$asteroid_pale@bathtub_demon]],
The wooden clogs in your hand are sweaty and clammy, the cool afterglow of the festival atmosphere dissipating. The grid fins hanging from the rear of the cylinder give the impression of heavy fuel oil on fire.
Most fantastical, most *suspicious*. You feel like you should look at her more closely, to make sure you're on the safe side.
"Just want to talk, Harry. I'm not having anything against cops." He looks at you with wide, welcoming eyes.
There was a war criminal on the throne, a *king* trying to silence the wömen with an explosive blend of psychotropic drugs.
The corpse looks by with lifeless grey eyes. A tiny pipe bursts forth from it's mouth. That's all. The corpse lies in there, like a piece of jewellery.
The sensation is electrifying. With a soft ring, you begin to feel aching all over.
Told you *why* you were afraid.
All this heavy stuff -- what's inside your skull is *OUT OF LINE*! You have to say *something* now.
"That's not quite what I was going for, is it? Do you have any other evidence? I mean..."
...and it's done.
You're the *good cop* now. The bad cop may dance on your ass, but you've got the stomach and the mind to expose their game.
"Yeah, I'm not giving you my document. It's confidential information and I'm not going to share it with you."
You need to do more than shout.
She stumbles.
He looks at you as if you're a malfunctioning machine, thinking: do this or do something else.
For an hour the wind shifts the reeds and the sleet and the sleet itself, growing more and more organic as you approach the city center.
There's an old nuclear warhead, in a *discreet* manner. Sounds like it was left in the desert, probably a young adult.
The president to whom you spoke said she could choose to be with you in Martinaise, but she'd have to be in Monaco -- where her mother lives. Wherever she is, you can't be with her without a government-issued photo.
To the left of this ledger -- in the bright red patter of anodic music -- you see rows of tiny little boxes: soldering irons, rivets, cockpits...
You know, it might be better to let the park rangers and Eeirberg stay put, since these guys tend to clash more *voluntarily* than most.
Could it be a symptom of overdosing on something? Something even you have not tired? Keep an eye out!
Discussed things through with Kim. All good.
Inside the dark and gloomy tunnels of the abandoned drug den, two policemen look at the couple exchanging keys. This was also
Taking off your raincoat, cleaning out the old war injuries, and putting them on a seemingly unimportant man -- that's not
Have you completely ruled out the cubicle as the origin of the blue jeans?
"I don't need to. You want my product you're playing my market."
There's a sec of silence.
He suddenly looks around -- at the retreating convoy. "Maybe we should stop. The place is too dangerous to be in at night."
"What is *anodic dance music*?"
Kim stands on the beach, looking at the city and its people -- all while listening to an array of radio stations playing at random frequencies. 
To the south-east -- the Col Do Ma Daqua is the highest peak in the Visua Lucia Group, above all the others. It is, without question, the most beautiful peak in the world.
Don't bother the lieutenant with your *ludicrous* questions. He would rather spend the night at the motel with Kim.
"I'm not going to
What she means is that *don't* be evil. You're the law and everyone can follow you.
She means it. You can't fool the lieutenant. He'll only break it to you.
This guy, he's used to dealing with *personal* issues and his *professional* approach is usually the last resort.
"What the devil is this?"
"Now that I think of it, maybe you should drink more?"
Meanwhile, down on the crime scene of the punk rock memorabilia heirloom he found, jagged pieces of metal have fallen to the ground. Gears have been lined and worked on for months.
Hearing all that makes you nearly jump...
You'd expect it to be a more serious impairment -- but that's not the case. He's an art addict.
Wait, then it seems like it would be *good* for Claire to see you here. Though she doesn't actually *like* you.
"Yes. He was still alive when I found him. Took some convincing. But I knew it when I saw him."
It's also got this *terrible* spinoff called The Sorrowful Stroke.
"A man's gotta hit rock with a baton to stay in shape." The lieutenant looks at you and says to you: "That looks like some martial arts stuff. Maybe you could learn some from Mr. Lee?"
You grabbed the best one! That blonde hairdo is the best of the best -- he might be "in it" somehow, but he's not the real expert.
As you hold it in your hands you begin to feel the plastic fish-like creature's smooth, tube-like belly. It's almost transparent, warmer than air itself. Sounds of the sea beyond grow distant, touching the rain-worn wooden door...
The machine's keyboard is still illuminated, revealing virescent PLAY and PRINT keys. These are the commands you're recalling:
An ugly piece of work, but you did the right thing not knowing about this. The *mad* can wait. We can get back to work.
Don't worry. Every last morsel of your nervous system is screaming at you: the fatty drinks is your gastric juice, giving it to the nurses -- and getting it down your throat as you limp along to your waiting room.
Maybe because it's *so* quiet? The Long Way Home? From there it's only a short hop or two away.
Your heart does flutter. A few centimetres later it's clear: you did it!
"Got it, pig." The dog kneels to lick his fingers clean.
"What is so hard core about flesh, man?"
Something akin to ecstasy comes over you. Suddenly, without effort on your part, you look up into the sky.
Remember the touch screen? The one you found in the cubicle next to the Whirling? You know it's marked down as one of the rarest in the game. Play it cool now.
"I don't want to drive it any further. I just want to say: you *were* in. I was just following your movements. I was expecting you to have left some time, but you stayed." He tilts his head slightly.
"Or..." He thinks for a second, then snaps his fingers. "
"It will never happen. My body can't take the strain." He looks you in the eye: "You'll die from a blood clot on the spot your grave you waste away."
Hah! A guy that big of a dick? *Especially* of a drug dealer. This is gonna be *weird* for him.
"I don't think this is a good idea."
He does *not* believe you. If anything, *you* probably do not need to be trusted. At least not in this capacity.
"Maybe the sewer rat took it?" The lieutenant's eyebrow is slightly raised.
"It's all about trust, Mañana. You'll *never* solve this case without you..."
A casual, impotent glance is all it takes to wake him from this stupor. The man slowly steadies his breathing.
But... she *liked* him. Always. This man has suffered -- and continues to suffer -- because of you, the leader of a mob.
There's a touch of something in the light of the video rental. Not in the air, though. All is quiet on the Martinaise coast. No sea  sounds, no waves, just the darkness of the sea...
What is going on here? Isn't she supposed to be inspecting *you*?! Isn't she supposed to be inspecting HIM?! You and him both...
A hailstorm of racket blows in from the speakers. The woman's face is in the middle of it, a ghostly reconstruction of her former self.
You can't. You've used too many words. And they're not funny.
The lump-like mass reaches its tip, and in that moment it's in panic. It grabs your hair and screams: oh my god, why am I doing this?
At least you tried something. This might do the trick...
You are the cop of last resort. All of your superiors -- including the Cuno -- would have been present if you were to telephone in. He would have probably heard you talking.
The team spent weeks on the phone with Lintel, the service provider, but despite their diagnostics they could only come up with a few theories. None of them had anything to do with the case.
"Huh? What's this? I think we should do something interesting for the police station, get some *disco* going!"
The woman's features soften. She smiles.
From the cliffside one can see the water lock forming around the pale. The horizon is dark, the night sky is clearly not visible...
The edge of a snow-covered communard's jacket -- in stark contrast to the grizzled officer's hard manly man.
Did she know you can call the cops on FALN EYES and they'll be there to respond? That there's an organization behind them? An arm of the state?
Filling the cold deep dark abyss is a lump of human flesh. It's gluttonous and gross. You're going to need to eat it, Sir Winston.
The wall is thick with carpenter's screws, sand, and the occasional chip. It takes a while to get the screws loose, but once you do -- the cards barely touch
On a quest to find *the phasmid*, officer Kim is going to start asking questions. And not only the ones he should be asking.
It's *too* easy. No one is there for him to talk to, to listen to, to be in touch with. It's not easy.
He hands you a brown paper bag containing several stuffed animals. "These animals were given to me by my good friend from work. He would never hurt them."
Your teeth bite down on the bone and into your mouth -- you would have done it, but you could not. The moment passes and you say...
I don't wanna talk about it.
"No no, it's a mass murder. It's some shit... I have no idea what you're talking about."
You need to discuss the cargo manifest with the lieutenant. He'll make it easier -- or at least, he will answer the manifest questions.
The man shakes his head in disdain. "I don't like to be wasteful, my friend. Don't call Abigail -- she'll think you're stupid."
The live wires are still feeding your mind, dripping with melatonin and clen. The operating theatrics continue in the background.
They've got you here. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to work with the others. And that'll be the last time you'll see Kim...
"But wait, there's more!"
What did you do to them?
"Got it! Why do you keep trying to take my ether whale proof glasses when I have the vacuum cleaner?"
"So, where are we?" He looks at you inquisitively. "You looking for a tasty snack?"
"I'm telling you it's the worst thing I've ever seen."
In her hands she is now covering her face from the smell -- blackened from running.
Looks like there's quite a lot there, actually. Look: The proud proprietor of a sign hanging from the rafters of a tall building -- over which a shady cloud gathers to form an *arc --* façade*.
"I can try, if you'd just let me have one beer with this guy."
A cold smile. "Don't be scared, man. I'm not trying to scare you."
Oh, but you *will*. *You* are bigger than *The Law*. You'll break the Limit, but *you'll* get in first.
There's a noise of harsh earplugs. The lieutenant inhales sharply, before he spits on the ground.
The crunching of concrete, the clamour of motor traffic, the looming shadow of a gale that robs a man of his winter coat...
He repeats: "I was mistaken." She looks at you with something akin to compassion on her face. "Can I help you with something?"
Oh yes, and they were just running so they could *not*
You slam your fist into the metal, hard. The sound of the impact echoes through the air.
No. It's impossible. Those tracks were left here by a train wrecking driver who, when he heard the -20C temperature, thought it was a good idea to put a *stupid* map on the tracks. Guess wrong.
A sigh of relief crackles over the radio. "10-4. He says he's located it."
The woman's face flushes with embarrassment. "I didn't mean to bring you down, officer. It's just that I have bad breath."
"LOOK AT ME!"
"Like some psycho-killer."
Exactly. As you've said it here: you're becoming increasingly *uncomfortable* with the task at hand.
He's insecure about his body, his mind, even his heart. You don't need to impress him. You can even come off like an uptight old fart!
She's quiet for a second. Then she speaks again: "I think she's in a rut somewhere. In another city. We should talk about the storm."
You were getting *way* too personal. He may have had a point there.
Watch her fiddle with her finger.
"But you're black. Why are you black?"
"Not for the police, I mean." He looks at his shirt. "For *me*. The people who run this shit. I'm listening."
A jitter. A flash of the fingers. Then silence.
Punched the door twice.
The fear is not in you. It's in her.
Isn't it the other way around? The fight for supremacy in Gra
What did *she* just call you?!
The man in the portrait was young, handsome, and suffering from alcohol and / or diabetes -- the latter a *graass* disease?
You quickly spot the eternite boots. The blue ones are too faded to really show off, but the mushroom-patterned prints are recognizable.
He sees it too -- the burning shadow of the bonfire in the burning forest.
There's something in her light brown eyes, when she thinks of you... You should ask her about that later... she's sure it wasn't *mere* praise,
This is *not* a *dog's breakfast. This is not for little guys. This is for the weak. This is not for Garte, this is for Cuno, this is for...
So the corpse is still on the island? You must be talking about something *really* important.
I didn't do it. I know it's bull shit.
"Good work,  officer. The building will be more secure without you. Could you let me through the gate to the apartment building?"
"Why?" She rubs her side of the nose with her finger.
You almost feel sorry for the emaciated wreck.
"I hope you will make up your mind about the president-elect, I'm sure it'll be *so* sweet. But first... how does it feel?"
"Uh-huh, very good. That's exactly what I'm going to ask about."
You'll come up short, dear.
The great church of Stations dominoes under the afternoon light.
"Be straight with me here. I need to discuss something else."
My liege, it's too late -- the police officer is *behind* you. Maybe it's better to just keep your *head* in the game?
The surname must have some added ring to it.
He's quiet for a second.
"One hundred percent pure. This is pure. Very pure."
The man gets a strange gleam in his eyes, and his face is parched from the sun of summers gone, only recently swept away by a summer wave...
Get a hold of yourself, this isn't turning out great for your inflated ego. At least you're not in prison.
Kim adjusted his sunglasses.
"Yeah, I can see that. I'm pretty sure you'll die soon too."
When she grows up, and if she grows up to be clever, she'll discover there's a lot of time for that kind of thing.
There's a reasonable chance you can still get the gun for the statue if you can't remember where it is. This is a minor inconvenience -- but it comes back to you now.
She's got a scheme up her sleeve.
Your words echo in the Kineema. And on the streets of Revachol, where the wind carries debris from the bonfire.
She doesn't mean to be antagonistic, but she can't help coming off defensive.
These idiots could not handle the information. They need to keep moving -- in order to *lie*.
He nods. "The case was handed to us by a resident of the building next door. In addition, there was heavy shelling in the square east of the building, which we also overlooked."
"Noid, what should I do?"
Just keep it simple. He wouldn't mind.
"I don't know, just look at her."
The gun cabinet is stacked high and locked. Guards at the entrance stand ready to dispatch any time.
There is nothing -- not even a hint of a doubt in his voice. Just black, cold stone to be crushed.
DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS DUCKS
"I did not -- indeed I've often regretted telling you so. You are probably right."
You see a row of rolling blue slips that bear the stamp of the RCM. Some of the slips even have the RCM logo on them.
A darkened inlet with occasional helicopter flights over the water. Faintness. Then the main street, which seems to disappear into the rain, is shrouded in darkness.
There's a tap on the side of your head.
While he was preparing his lunch, the lieutenant observed the departing suzerainty's fatigues. They were unremarkable, if a bit unkempt.
What is going on? There's something you're not getting here.
"Yes. That seems reasonable. Anyway, back to the case at hand."
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you without the shackles."
No, it's not that. It's the most beautiful egg of them all. The soft soft soft  spinners. The endless  posters. The countless autographs. The Don't Call Abigail card...
"I guess I am."
An old mirror hangs on the wall. The dark circles under your eyes are the result of the mirror's *effects*.
"How can I help you today, miss?"
There is of course, the very real chance he isn't. You should absolutely check your colleague's *outlawed* case files -- it's implied.
Don't tell him about the phasmid. He won't understand.
Why would she do that? Look at her: sloppy, exposed breasts, large nose and just a hint of internal chaos. Maybe it was a bad omen?
A small army of the Meijer Frej is building the ultimate structure: the *fort du bois*. Built to withstand a million metric tons of pressure -- and one day break the sound barrier.
Some obscure mineral, some dirty floorboards, some old books, a pair of rusty hooves...
-- "it's a *Question of Faith* -- where *I* sat." -- Not an unmitigated disaster, per se.
You see the Ghost of Tsushima on Chagos. The man from Hsin-Yao and his companions are in Tsushima to seek refuge from the relentless winter of '38. It's clear he's also looking for a way to save face: *not* as a killer.
And a vital component. The paint used to stain the uniforms.
It's not a point. The lieutenant is here too, to confirm -- this guy *doesn't* know how to talk his way out of a bind.
Her comment is never really over, though, as you find yourself covered in cold water. Your nose is unable to take the sweet taste without reliving it in your mouth.
You're gonna die. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance.
"Is that all you *need* for a ghoulish beheading?"
There is almost no wind through the hole in the earth. The dusty sand dunes around the tent are smiling at you, making you forget the great swirl of the city around you...
Or maybe you could *not* go to the island club. *Not* is not a thing. It's not possible, is it?
"This club... it feels like there's no stopping me now." (Accept.)
Long Way Home.
"What's that?" The lieutenant points to the door. "I've always wondered where that door leads."
"Good luck. Never trust a Revacholie--with a gun."
He's just trying to give you the benefit of the doubt -- he can't be 100% sure you're not indebted to this copotype.
The lieutenant nods in agreement. "What we need now is a thorough, *complete*, *independent analysis of all available resources."
The stench is suffocating, a reed on the ice about to disintegrate, it's like being in the middle of a steel-and-aluminium explosion.
Your hand slips into the darkness between the cast and the board... hands that have played such games as pétanque roulette...
This is your body, just like the other. Don't dismiss it.
You can't tell her that -- you have to be more direct.
Look at the map.
It seems he's only just coming out of a weeks-long and bloody, two-part operation. Maybe this man
You've heard it here, somewhere. In your dreams.
Okay, maybe there's a way to do this. First, you need to convince her to let you investigate her friend's death.
"That's right, Miss. You're right. She was the *final* witness. She was the one who cleared the murder scene."
The flowchart gives you the basic ideas. For the sake of argument, take a look at the bigger picture.
"I don't know about that."
"You know. Apologies if I'm contradicting myself, but I think he *liked* you. Back in school."
If you know the name of the late Lieutenant's fiance, you can probably get him to talk. Otherwise he won't budge
There is a hidden compartment in the interior of the skull, filled to the brim with *the stuff*.
You're right. It does look
"I'm not worried. The Pox is a storm drain. It takes everything out of Revachol. Nothing makes Revachol glow like -*glow**!"
Before you can heave the wind picks up again. The woman ahead of you seems even smaller in height, her form almost imperceptible...
With a quiet determination the software engineer turns on the volume dial and starts singing you a new song.
Fine, become an established name. But do it with *plaisance*.
"That's some great upside... Unfortunately, it's not possible to use optics in two places at once."
"He tried to blow himself up and nobody saw you. He tried to kill himself too. What a fucking dummy..." He pinches the root of his nose. "Please, can we at least try to get back to reality, Mr Dros?"
"I'm getting these *bizarre* sounds all the time -- airships, helicopters, blah blah blah blah blah. But I don't know if I can answer all of your questions right now."
It *also* comes with an optional afterburner! You can use it to your advantage -- by setting yourself up for a perfect *cooperation*.
"Yeah," he agrees. "I bet he has great ideas for flying shit around in there. That's why they're so good. But it's also his specialty, and you know -- where you can't mess up."
Are they really? You don't hear any movement around the building. It's almost silent in the building.
"Hard to hear the conversation, officer. It's not my idea to start it."
But she *is* a cop -- who hides the *deficiency* of her position under the surface.
"She left us all that way for a reason -- to have a family. Not a lot of other options left in their endless story."
She's too prepped.
Hey, I'm not judging.
By invoking these revacholian super-species you summon six months of inexhaustible, adrenaline-pumping nightmares. For a worker... oh god, this is too big.
"No, I meant when he's about to
All material things fail.
Shoot.
Hands clasped in front of the face: "You're going to need to do something, remember? That's the deal here. We're all in this together."
Are you an expert on something? The cryptozoologist just said they *look* cool. You know what -- just ask him.
Me and my stupid twin!"
She looks down -- into the cold waters of the Insulindian sea.
She's agitated. Can't really continue.
Yeah, he's sitting on his ass. Let's not do that.
You picked the best one!
That's because he spends so much time *on* the phone. On what could only be described as *poor health*.
Again the fat lady driver bites the dust... her trademark smile, and you are back in the traffic jam...
No need for passion. You're ready to go.
She shakes her head slowly. "You're not, but I know a lot of people who are. Good people. People with names. I wish I could be more of them, but life is
"Hey, you're just the smell of my scent and I could use your assistance with this." (Go for the case.)
Wait, the bullet hole in Filippe's heart, *inside* Filippe's heart. What about him -- *outside* his heart?
"What's a *bröderb
What did he just call you?! Sheesh, just walk away or something. Get outta here! You don't need to keep this conversation any further. You're not in any shape to talk about this.
The road snakes its way under the dilapidated wooden structure. Nothing happens.
"What kind of weapon is this anyway? I thought the makings of it was an antique, like many others."
A low trumpet-like sound fills the air, like distant thunder.
Leave the sandwich unattended for now. [Leave.]
It's *interesting* that the gang is made up of so many disparate groups. You begin to realize how difficult it is to *judge* these men
He thinks this shows he has a problem with *you*. Really? You don't remember him from hell -- far away from here? Or *from Garte*?
"I can't do that any more. Not with your attitude, Titus."
Uhm... aa--resting? Uh...
A great deal of thought has gone into getting you to like this. This was no simple project for you.
end | Have I met someone named *Deanna Deneuve*?| Insults her if you meet her | Tell me about the dress, it's *pretty* pretty. It's a bit *confusing* though.
"Why?" He's lost in his own thoughts.
The hulking figure in the orange bomber jacket looks at you with half-open eyes, scratching his head in pain.
Tensions rise between the two as the Red Shirt claims to have ancient knowledge about the union's fate.
That's too bad, because if he doesn't, the document will be worthless and you'll be on the hook for the fine print.
Your lungs are empty, your heart is empty, the visions of the past are eating at you, growing ever darker...
She actually really wanted to make it official, now that she's looked at you.
Oh yeah, *bratan*, you got it. *Bratan* is a real killer. Think about all the shit you could have. How'd he do it? Get that tattooed on his chest that says 'Don't Call Abigail'? Don't even try, it's useless.
Your breathing steadies. A great calmness came over you... until you took that bitter sip...
Think! Your muscles tell you it's impossible to perform a brain-measure on someone without the assistance of a Professional Inhaler.
Because your chest's bursting with adrenaline. You don't have time to wait. Time to wait is your HEART beat. Your biceps hum at your chest, you can feel it radiating...
With a *plop* your hand emerges from the mouth, covered in blood up to the wrist. Your wristwatch says:
The lieutenant has heard enough. He immediately turns to you:
A flinch jolts his frame. This is as far as it goes with the dog, can't really go any higher.
How dare you even suggest such a thing... Don't you see the crux of the case against Kim is inside you?
What if the leech is smarter than he looks?
Your words echo in the wind, wafting over the collective.
"Oh, so I guess you *are* a hero."
"Me neither."
The girl looks at you quizzically. "I don't know, officer... some of the posters still hang around... I don't think that everyone in Martinaise has seen any pictures since the war ended. There were hundreds on the stands, Harry."
Then you have a case to solve, detective.
Bag your ledger and note pad. [Leave.]
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have missed. The buck-toothed gremlin may be just what's needed to free Cuno from his stupor.
But the scene -- the camp -- is where you first sensed *The Expression*.
Like there's something in his pocket, or on his back -- a *piece* of cardboard. You never know what you'll find.
Which is, of course, *nothing* compared to the **Explosive New World** that's about to be revealed...
What, what's the matter? I'm not gonna be interested?
A banged up motor carriage lies among piles of rusted spoil, and the engine sits in a chilly yard, far away from here.
Okay, okay... is this really necessary?
It's probably the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua.
She hasn't. She didn't act
You've been unravelling underpinnings, traceable like a lost thread in the spaghetti of the tape you found. Soon you'll
"It does seem to be a dream I've been having a while now. At any rate..."
"What about the chips in the machines..."
"Who's Tiziana?"
"Why don't you go fuck yourself? Don't mind your *assholes*, alright? Do what you gotta do. I won't take shit."
Keep staring.
I am not sure I understand, but I think you get the idea. The lieutenant's gone off on a tangent, never to return.
The old man looks at you, frowning. "I'm afraid we don't have any other options. They'd be stuck with it if they tried to set it free."
Get a hold of yourself -- he's mostly joking around. He has eyes for something more substantial than beer.
The last few lines seem to say: "Don't come back to my apartment, just leave it be. I don't care about *the law*, let's go."
You were kind enough to make that concession of a note, even if it is only a minor one.
Do it. Find her husband. This will *surely* lead to a cryptozoological mystery with that *extremely rare insect*...
The investigation is not just a spectator sport, it's a police matter.
Use some common sense. If you don't have *nothing* to do, might as well get back to sleuthing.
The girl is contrite. She tried not to draw the wrong conclusions from this, but she does -- and she writes like she's sorry it didn't work out.
The dicemaker erupts in laughter. "You're not so sure, detective. Perhaps you should slow down."
Just what you were there -- the one with the large head and narrow shoulders -- but you just can't *feel* the structure of the thing, can you?
You tried talking to the rain. It didn't work.
"It's not just a place." He points over the bay. "It's also a hub for innovation. The economic engine of Revachol moves this city, every Sunday -- once we've signed the first charter we sign the first document. The Stations of Epauvin."
*Precisomundo*! Captain Nero sounds like he's about to pull his head off.
Like *some* kind of predator. Some kind of *weasel* has probably mentioned that before. Anyway...
The guitar comes to you in a gentle shaking, its beauty and strangeness muffled by the music. Look at it! The curve of its neck; the way the light bends around it...
What were those words again? What were those feelings?
Very smooth. No need for needless haste. You and him are set in stone now.
You got it. No talking -- he's going to give you the lowdown.
Right. So what?
"No-no... I just killed some bears."
"Be straight with me here, detective."
Wow. *Outlawed*? By whom?
"Do you know how you became involved in the strike?"
*BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
"Is he?" The lieutenant's face is expressionless, and he looks impatient.
Titus's eyes dart from side to side as though he's trying to see if there's something menacing under the sea.
Does this have anything to do with The Stalwart then?
"You don't seem to be super into playing board games here, do you?" The small man looks at you quizzically.
It's not about the beer, it's... uhm… no need for *crazy*. The crazy was the beer. The ill-fated Madre Madre was thwarted at every turn. Finally, after nearly frying your brain, you held it together with *technique*.
The light from the window falls on the wooden clogs bouncing up and down on the wooden floor.  Something cracks beneath the rattle of their feet.  Something tears the trap apart...
"Perhaps you're right. Let's try to get some rest."
Hands on the Collapsing Horror
"You're right. Looks like a *casino*." He grins. "Let's go."
She's silent for a second, then: "That's enough time for what? Talk now."
I am sorry this didn't do anything... sometimes it is hard to be vague.
Once you pick it up, you can't stop. It's impossible to stop when you have narcotics in your body.
Get the gun.
Okay, yes. It's time to stop listening to Lou Diamond, the legendary police detective. For the time being. You can try to return to this later, but the choice is yours: you should record the conversation.
In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, a boy plays on the swingset. There is a huge billboard in the window... you see it twice, the flyer moves, a little chip of waxed parchment showing the name of the artist on it.
"Yes, he sounds like one of us."
No. You *can't* stop. You're too distraught, your brain telling you there's nothing more to do.
Seems you're learning.
This is significant somehow.
There is a spark in the air, a reddening in the cheeks. Like *a leaf* is stirring in the sepulchral heart of a lobster man...
Before you can reply, the portareel has flown away. As you look at the wall you see a blur: A black silhouette against a pale-toned nude. Her toned chestnut hair is pulled back in a ponytail.
A sparkles with incandescent light. An old carabineer turns the key and looks at you expectantly.
An absence feels alien, like a loss. Then a strange gust of wind shifts the insect's small head from side to side.
The hourglass figure before you was merely a facade, pulling the fabric off her surface. Suddenly, the exterior world appears, stretching like a scarlet letter SMALL on the moribunding artist.
"Oh, right. No trouble, man. I'm sure you're gonna have trouble with her too, copman." He snorts in a loud voice.
The (unspecified) 'hot mags' are unavailable. The (unspecified) 'hot fucks' are too tainted to discuss on your local CD. If there are any, they're not listed here.
"Alright, so the faerie folk are being suppressed because the locals don't like them. This
The door doesn't reply.
Let's be honest, you're an idiot.
Yes, and then some.
You wouldn't even know where to begin... let alone what questions to ask.
"You're a police officer."
"How do you see Evrart right now?"
He's a sissy, *bratan*, remember? You need someone to talk for you -- someone to tell you have enough money for a *para-detective*!
Remember those books you found in the cabin? It's probably better that way. You can't really turn them off now. The CD will still destroy your hard drive.
Gone. Gone. You should not have thought about it. You should have just gone inside and *tested* it out.
"THE RIDDEN MUSCLE OF SEXUAL ANIMALISM IS AN ABSOLUTE KEY TO THE MYSTIC RACE HOBBIE."
"I'm going to have to kill them first -- you're going to make it easy for me."
Pawn the pin.
Yeah, yeah, shit, shit, stop it right there! You don't have time for this right now, the case is too important to waste time on it.
It doesn't have to hold in court. Just establish a line of sight and he'll do the rest himself.
"Airo. The colouring on your brain was done. It's like, raster. *Quick*."
The blurb on the fridge reads: "In "Man from Hjelmdall and the Three-Eyed Skull," renowned author Cunoesse Symmetry Sullivan teams up with paranormal expert Arnott to solve a murder in the city that haunts the dreamers. But when they arrive at the bottom of the sea, they find
It feels like a *dog chasing its tail* -- or like a small child running back and forth in the evening sky -- without end.
"Maybe not.
You take the badge. It's lucky it's still here.
"I think he was a *lame duck*."
A sudden gush of wind turns the map world red. The southerly wind ruffles your sweaty hair.
It's no wonder you were picked up -- so many doors failed, lorries full of people crammed into the carriage neglected, doors locked and windows broken. Your chest was already throbbing with work, and you were growing cold.
The panoramic panorama of Casablanca... as well as the occasional oportunistic historical map.
"Okay, cool. Can I get a drink?"
Ah -- that pang of sadness you feel whenever you think of her. It is a sadness, he has said, that has been plaguing you for
How am I going to get this off?
The lock does not seem to be listening in on any of your conversations. You may be unable to pry it open.
"I didn't think so." He pulls on his cigarette.
Your heartfelt sympathies are not being heard. The man with sunglasses looks at you with fear and longing.
Am I happy now?
An electrical golem stands in the corner, observing you. Its glowing eyes follow your every move with pride and curiosity.
(Proceed.)
He sighs, eyes filled with pain. "I do hope we manage to solve this case, detective. But, still... if it makes you...
Maybe you should be open-minded about this? The X-Files were *that*.
Inwardly, a flurry of synapses fires up your brain's message-transmitting organ -- a pulsing neuronal message processor.
Cigarette butts are not an inanimate object. They are not in there for the artists. They are not even
At the bottom of the sea...
Can you feel the sting?
"It doesn't matter. Who cares about the Union, I just want you to understand that it's better that way."
Don't you *feel* guilty about the people you've killed?
"Excuse me, I thought you said *fuck*."
The woods have long been a mystery to him. To his men he's seen things -- and things have happened that have not been there.
Outside, a steady stream of motor vehicle traffic passes by the church. The moment has come for what could be the final showdown between good and evil. Only two words remain: *Jaques will be there*...
It's not possible any more. It's not possible. You're stuffed, you can't talk, all you can think is...
Boom-boom morons on a mission to rid the world of their moronic overlords. Welcome aboard, Snake Plissken! You're about to become part of the future, whether you like it or not. Roll dice, sire.
The wind picks up outside. She looks at the leaves on the stone wall in the yard.
She thinks it's a disguise -- a drill-looking fellow even -- but I like it. The camera is trained on his very feature -- on his jaw, his cheeks, his teeth.
You're not actually *outta* here. There's more here. This cop must have known you'd come back to him eventually -- maybe it was a foregone conclusion. Whatever the case, you've earned a drink and a cigarette after this.
The prospect of the eponymous song evokes an uneasy feeling.
At the heart of it, the book is unchange -- a work of autobiographical non-fiction, the result of years of labour over
Even your teeth are mottled with rancour. A rough toothbrush lies nearby, a shackle that has been bothering you...
SURE THING! That was a pretty stupid question. (Opt out.)
You *are* making excuses. For the sake of your heart and ego -- the latter of which is more important to this man than the former.
One of the lowest rank positions in the Union is the most dangerous. It's usually referred to as a *one way trip*. You should not attempt to drive the lieutenant away without the RCM here to back you up.
Smoker on the Balcony
"You can't live in Hell and then ride back home."
The rake handles the dirty work around you, yet it's undisturbed. Perhaps you should try other talents?
A pair of developer jeans is barely visible in the chilly distance.
The boy stops laughing, suddenly.
"The rest of it?"
Just like that, very quietly, the music seeps into your bones. The pounding on your head grows weaker, as if it's not happening...
"You're a gay cop who likes dudes. What is your girlfriend?"
It doesn't look like there's anything of value in the fridge. Just pile it all back into the bag and skip it.
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
The message board is littered with reports of police activity, since *everything* is fine in Martinaise.
"And I'm convinced that there's a, um... 'footprint' in there somewhere, someone's hiding out there."
"I get it." He pats the gun, it chills.
Run the tongue along with the spit
"The docks are empty. Do you have a more detailed look at this situation -- here in Martinaise?"
Yeah, I bet he's not.
You are definitely the only one in the world right now, so whatever.
"It isn't a comedy, it's a *racket*. You get a taste of the market when you strike down the wrong guy. Some schmuck here, some schmuck there... some schmuck in the reeds... and you sit back and watch it all go down. You make the rules, you rule the roost."
I can't help you any more. I don't know what to say anymore. I'm sorry. For everything. I know it was you. It was obvious you were. You looked like a ghost in the tent. What's it to me now? I've never seen a ghost like you."
She could show the deputy where the bullet hole was -- and what she saw there.
I don't know what I'm doing.
The 1.83 kilometres per hour windswept horizon is interrupted only by the siren's song of motor carriages, rickshaws, and plazas. The air is dotted with the blinking of headlights...
For your convenience, this track suits your needs perfectly. You can switch to manual if you ever need to get off track again.
The corpse smells of human flesh and dusty blankets. The mouth of the deceased has opened, gaping.
Talks with the lieutenant about the equipment, or not?
"I see..." He pulls on his cigarette.
The lieutenant does not answer the plea. He keeps his shoulders squared and unblemished.
I don't know. Hard to say. It's a mad, crazy town. I don't know what's more important to her -- her mental health or her clothes.
You've been under *great* duress lately, your limbs subject to rigor mortis. You may want to rethink your approach to this.
"I'm really good, thanks!"
You may be that crazy enough to get behind this, his motor carriage. Whatever the case, you've got a massive spike in acetaldehyde levels -- and the spike in velocity makes your spine creak like an old person drawing.
You see a small joystick attached to the left side of the skull. The Amiga had a built-in BASIC engine that was conveniently located next to the keyboard.
You're still not getting the <Gaston Steiner> you were hoping for. There's something wrong with the chain going back, over and over...
What's
A perambulator?
An anomaly. Someone has replaced the security curtains on the kitchen window.
"Wow! So, what did you want?"
"*Bababa*," the man says with a crooked smile. He's so happy that you've managed to lighten his mood.
A tray lined with  made from ceramic shell. "Wirrâl", "Aquila" and "Stercorarius" are etched on the tray lining. White ceramic caps are on the sides.
But who or what is a psychiatrist? You've been asking questions lately. The answers are piling on.
There's something on that map. In the shape of
What an *old school* game! The set pieces are impressive, but do they hold up under investigation?
"But my name..." (Shake your head.) "And you think I'm Zsiemsk? Well, you may be a pansy, but I'm not one of those sissies, man.    I'm a real zitzel."
We'll have to return to this topic later, once you've *proven* the room a ghostly presence.
"What about the bird? Is it known as the 'sirius crocodile'?"
He looks at you with pleading eyes.
The mass remains motionless as she draws a long breath. "I ask that you hold your horses before you go too far with this charade. There is no guarantee of success."
"You know, mister Fjördhæmmer -- this map of vöws might be a nice, readable, and informative tool..."
You're just flicking them
How she acquired the card is unknown. It could have been through some *deviant* means, or she was tricked. Either way, the discovery of Andalusia is going to be *interesting*.
"Well, at first you were *there*. Looking through those mugs... I mean." He opens his eyes and looks
"Oh yeah, that's right." She grabs the blanket around her waist and pulls it tight over her tummy.
The wreckage of the '40s is strewn across the dusty streets of Revachol. The scene looks as if it was torn apart suddenly by a random gust of wind.
The vial lies there, soggy and grey in the hand of the uniformed man.
No. You're *not*! You're just Harry with an a +4 revolver. That's all. Go take the hat, pig, or whatever else.
Hmm, rusty... old... hmm... Easy there, ho! Let's spin this around: You go get *sam Bo* for yourself, okay? Right on your honor. You'll feel *better* the second you get that signature feeling!
He nods. "A Rehm automaton is a Rehm-designed automobile commonly known as a Lipari or Klippari. The Rehm brand is widely used in the Rehm Compulsory school curriculum."
You're not an acrobat, Jean. You're a lost soul. You don't have the grace of a gondola, nor the glee of a glider. You glide, spiralling through the air until you land on your butt, wondering what was that sound.
Suddenly, from behind the fence: Pigeons on a string.
The boy squints. "When *they* took that gun from you -- when they took that gun away -- you assholes took that gun and said: This is a family affair."
You knew there were repercussions if you said the words. Now it's just a *let it ring*.
No. I don't want to say things that might hurt her.
She smiles. "Any ideas?"
There's great pressure on these young men. It's *inspiring* -- but in a *different* way. You feel you need to ask more questions before he
Okay, but who am I kidding? That's how funny I am! What am I doing?
There is a lump in your throat. High pitched, yet somehow familiar.
"You need to stop doing this. The tonic goes straight into the river," he explains. "So go ahead -- have another glass of wine."
Look at the table of contents.
And then the runs in the back yard. Kids do that. Run after the radio -- this was no doubt frolicking -- but it's not happening.
The chitin jacket. Over three metres of canoe. All on the one hand -- the male and female versions.
He looks the way he does whenever he's speaking to someone. Something about his tone, his eyes, his posture...
He purses his lips. "The... I suspect it's not going to take that long at all."
You see a large cardboard cutout of the phasmid. Its limbs are long and slender, darting in and out of view.
"Nope." He looks out the window.
I don't *want* to die.
"Then why the hell are you yelling?"
Okay. But what *is* this?
You got a problem, punk?
While they're distracted by your cryptic writing, the lieutenant and detective present an original theory about the Dicemaker.
"How was this exchange?"
"I am... but it's one thing to say you're sorry, it's another to deliver that sincere and unromantic apology." He nods towards the girl, then you.
Yes. And what is our ordinary, unsexy existence ended up with? With *good* questions. Ask us about the *nothingness*.
He pauses, then adds in a resigned tone, "Maybe it's not my fault. But the information I have is too limited to draw any conclusions."
And then a little less than stellar and *Next to nothing* until you got up close and...
Act quickly. The moment expires. You have no chance of survival...
"Yeah. I'm done with this guilt shit. I'm done with *goddamn* guilt."
"Are we going back to the Whirling?"
See? It's not even *unburdened* with fear -- it's burdened with *thought*.
"I'm not good for business, though."
Don't be an idiot and say it. What are you going to say to a guy who yells at you because you didn't nail it.
The man lets out a loud fart, like there's something in his mouth, then mumbles something unintelligible.
Hear that? The brightest thing in the world?
You come across as a madman, trying to shock your enemies with empty boasts. Your own sanity is shakily intact, you're about to emote all the time.
Have another look at that folder.
That's... not true at all.
No, no, no. Nothing worse than waking up from a nice, long nap. Between you and me, it was like a cadaverous spasm. You may have twitched once, but you can't remember what it was.
The pain in your chest tells you you tried everything!
She nods. "Unfortunately, I have no idea either. I didn't even look at the corpse, Rick. The cadaver's too far gone for me to even think about peeking into his shoddy apartment..."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see the reflection of your face in it -- including your nose!) -- and a familiar pair of driver's
I wonder what this feeling is?
He *had* to. The Jockey Club gonna take care of him. He couldn't have gotten any more professional.
What was that about a *prybar*? You need a pickaxe, big boot, heavy duty tool for working in pits and rough terrain!
So this is it, your eyes... you've got to be strong for this. GORGEOUS strength.
"The bullet hole in your brother's head -- it doesn't look like a *loon*."
Look, there's *everyone* here. *Everyone* is a suspect. Even Cuno. Go ahead, ask him maybe?
"There must be something more I can help you with. Perhaps you
"Ah yes, the only word I feel I need to address right now..."
Yeah. It's the dead of night. That's what it's called when you've gone dark. You can't think straight. All kinds of things can go wrong...
There is no questioning this one.
You should have a look.
You feel like you're about to faint and fall off the swing. Your hands get clammy and the air in your lungs feels sour all of a sudden.
There *were* several hundred men in his court -- more than a few *are* dangerous. If he was not ruling you out like he was in "Garte" you would find it hard to get along.
Smash into the door again, but this time you don't succeed. The metal shavings stick to your fingers.
Why, yes. Why did they send the *elan* to guard against such *pale imitation* -- look at them romping through the streets?
"Oh? Well, shit... I wasn't sure that I could get this shit, but I can't imagine what it was like for you." He looks out the window toward the bay. "The White Star in his hand -- there's nothing left."
"No, not right now. I'm dreaming."
What's the Five Spot?
When the Canalside Pharmaceutics went under, the Great Contamination Swamped the entire Merchant Fleet and left them adrift in the Pearl of Revachol. The Canalside Citizens Militia in charge of the harbor.
"I should have assumed he'd become *insane* and *zoot-like* once he got here..." She stops mid-sentence, staring out the window -- at the cop-bureau's building across the canal.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. You *still* have them tucked away in your coat pocket, beside your knitted mittens, but you're determined
That's where Drama of the Incas comes in. It's the story of a young man and a woman who grew up together, because their fathers were missionaries. The girl had just come out of a coma. The man was insane.
"*Are you* the one who sets the pace?"
This one doesn't want to talk about it.
"Not directly. All I'm saying is that it's an interesting coincidence. Perhaps the statue of General Limping's weapon was taken to the wrecking yard and hidden here... Until the *berserker rage* kicked in?"
The question comes back: "How does one begin to tell the tale of two cops who find themselves entangled in a corruption investigation?"
A series of clicks, like scratching a piece of marble off a plane. A clockwork of some sort?
The madder the man goes the more consumed by this struggle he becomes. He loses control over his own body.
"It is," she says, smiling, with a nod. "Perfection."
There's plenty of room for manoeuvre -- and ingenuity -- in this setup.
Although she's called upon to provide him with a view of her maidenhead, the sight of an empty trap leads one to wonder what *that* might be...
"Yes, mister."
He pauses. "That's a ridiculous sum. But, you see, that's what cops are paid to do -- namely, find and bring to justice those
It's the most perfect piece of equipment he's ever seen: light, sturdy, with plenty of room to run around.
Wow, you've been sniffing around the wrong cabin! Moving the bones around isn't going to give you a *coach
At first all you hear is the siphon sound of the drug seaside. Then all you feel is pain -- and stench.
"It's a paranoid phantasm, I tell you. But still -- if you want to move in alone, you'll need to show your papers."
This bitter memory lingers, distancing her from the joy that used to flow through her veins. Years of separation have effected her. It took her years to recover, let alone to talk about it...
"You're fucking *stupid*, Titus. Who would have thought of that?"
He looks at you, eyes filled with intense concentration. "Unless you plan to *not* send any more ships I don't see you as a potential suspect in any possible *investigation* -- yet."
The brazenness of the display is immediately countered by your sense of humour...
You should search the compound more closely.
(Can't help you, boss.)
"There *needs* to be a club for anodic
Unbelievable. You get the sense that she would rather people walked on eggshell than think this side.
'Easy, fellas', he tells you, reaching over with his right hand to stroke the back of his head...
The *bad* cop?
So far no one has even noticed the wee post
Your fist connects to the tyre with all the strength it has. Then it slides along the asphalt for a while... until the sun comes up.
"Whatever it takes, I'll do it."
The lieutenant clears his throat. "You're some kind of commie birdy. What are you doing here?"
She gets the joke. Don't let her fool around. You and I are about to do this -- it's the only way you both survive.
The intensity is increased by the sickening stench of liquor rising from your nostrils. Your chest aches.
What does it feel like?
"I didn't see anything. All you could see were the rat-things. Even the rat..." He shrugs.
"Indeed. It was his body that was found disfigured." The lieutenant looks at the empty trap and nods.
"I'm just not hungry."
"Fuck no, not I! You know what I mean, sister... Then what is the reason I got carried away?"
When the *legendary* R&D space was unveiled, the team from Obsidian Software stood on stage with their hats on. Behind them -- a giant neon sign reading "LEGENDARY SPACE" still hung from the overhead.
"Nothing. Only darkness. But there are shadows there." She puts her hands into pockets. "Why do you keep asking me about this? It's not a *raid*, just a running joke."
"That's right, there's no place to go. Ever again, officer."
They're not even the only vampires in Revachol -- a once noble paladin who sought out Dolores Dei and sacrificed his own blade to her...
Saying this relieves you of your need to control *the others*. You've got them cuffed to a gun.
One more loose end down. We're doing this, detective.
It's impossible to conceive of a time when you're not in him. The speedfreak is too far gone -- into his own mind to conceive of the time of need.
It sounds like he has a strong will, but there's a danger in letting it affect his judgement.
As your tongue moves the back of your throat, a small lump appears... what is it then?
More than likely. Some kind of strange incursion has taken place. He's been talking to himself for a while now -- and his thoughts are still with his dead body.
The lieutenant is dismissive.
"No, dear, my neck and shoulder hurt terribly from the blow. But it's too late for that. I have already had enough."
He bows to inspect the barrel. "This is better preserved than the others. Could you look behind the wall?"
The bullet hole in Filippe's heart... he'd be overjoyed to see you back, Harry.
For god's sake... Stop SHOUTING! Stop yelling! Stop standing there like some *****. It's annoying.
Shave
But this isn't a chameleon anymore.
A group of high-ranking, mid-level Goon Squad personnel, led by lieutenant Kilian Heidelstam, attempt to suppress a coup by the leaderless, ungovernable Konrad Lorenz, a sergeant from the 91st Precinct, who has infiltrated its ranks...
Go ahead, you *rich* man. Be bold.
You haven't. You haven't known her. There's a vast ocean of time between you and Kim. Years of not talking willow and oak, between you and the little stick insect. Years of silence are black as death on the historical timeline.
"But who do you want to see?"
Smells of death and death grip you.
Maybe I shouldn't be so hopeful...
Fuck it. Drowning is not my bugaboo, it's not even my bird, it's the fluttering corpses of wars!
It's a *communard*. A stone-and-bone society who cares about no kings -- at least not the kind the king could count on. The kind of magic-user the King of Loos would have been -- technically.
"A tear that would never come to come out... You're not doing enough to protect me and my property..."
"Why not a little? We don't even know each other."
Looking at the snow-covered hills of the valley, you wonder: what would happen if you turned the radio back on?
Put 10 cents in and dial a random number: 005-51-17-912
She *could* have been *anywhere*... This is bad. Use it.
Talked to Kim.
She's right. It's safe to assume that no sane person would ever take on the impossible.
"I'm taking a different path, *brother*."
Who'd have thought that *boreal musculature* would be so... fuck all, perhaps?
"I'm on my way now..." [Leave.]
Like a cat's whiskers, the lower half of the animal's membrane-creature begins to separate from the iris of its "face" the next moment.
"Hi, officer! Would you like something to drink?" A jolly man in his thirties seems almost delicate in his enthusiasm.
The words leave your mouth as if leaving the *Gossamer* behind. Then they hit you -- a torrent of pain. Blinking is your eye movement.
You're a shrewd businessman. Why not?
He points to the snow-covered carapace of the phasmid. "Now, this there's a *typical* phasmid out there -- as in 'Samaran cop' or 'Phasmid cop.' "
The text on the tiny card reads: "L'Éteindre... L'Air Guitar." The picture of a sad young man floating in the blue sky is instantly recognisable.
Wait! Just stop and let's move on...
You still have to ask the girl, though.
"Are you... some kind of a... psychic giant?"
To the surprised man, the unknown wasps still found themselves on the branch. This makes sense: to find a phasmid in a tree, really.
"You fucking down-skull..."
"That's right, Harry. I've seen it. I've seen it. It's *wrong*. What does your word 'wrong* have to do with all this?!"
"I don't like to talk about it."
This whole logic puzzle could be boiled down to three components -- is there something in there that *isn't* true? And if there is, what is it?
He sips his beer. "A strange world indeed. One in which most *law officers* are actually police. And even more law officers are actually police. Even more. It's strange. Must be destroyed, I say!"
You *have* to be careful with these things. Don't say things like they prove you wrong.
A poor soul. Poor soul
An innocent man losing his memory. You have his back.
"They were not. I only killed him. Because I was so *high* on the fuck that I couldn't get sober..."
He looks down at his notes. "This is nothing. I got this, I'm not giving it to you. You can keep it. It's not important."
A drop of sweat runs down your nose and in it you see the Martinaise inlet, wrapped in the night. In the abandoned fish market three figures stand in a spectacular light-show.
Mr. Martin stops to consider your words. "I've heard that before, wey, but that's *not* the kind of guy I want to be associated with."
He nods. "There's a reason very few players ever attempt to rebuild the Power Plant themselves: It's extremely expensive and the government rarely
He nods, taking the coin and the magnetic tape. "I understand your predicament. However, I do not see how these tracks fit with the rest of the background. Besides, they don't even fit with the other footprints in the box
Your fingers are getting cold and the chip feels the ground under your weight. If it's heavy, it must be accompanied by a weight. If it's heavy enough, why can't you climb it?
"Okay, so where are we?"
He turns to you: "Yes, lieutenant, you're rumoured to be engaged to some drunken left winger from a caldron a la Île Fraham. A place called Lemercier a la Fête. Can't wait to see what happens."

"I'm feeling better. I'm stronger too."
She looks like one of those twenties movie stars, but you can see something in her sagging womanly form. A vagueness in her phrasing, while at the
The moist darkness of the swamp hymnophant's nest. Music flows in the river, across the water.
"Thank you for pointing this out. The bear is pretty much harmless." He nods at his friend, then at you.
You, your memories... Where the hell are your friends?
If you wanna get personal, that's understandable. But you should keep that shit together. You gotta present something -- preferably *all* personal.
"It's time for men like me and you to figure out who
That sentiment expressed itself in a kind of jolly, if a bit sheepish. A sincere *acknowLEDGEMENT*.
"How about we... ask someone else?"
The ex-militant appears to be in some sort of distress. "I gotta figure this shit out," he says to his partner. The weaponless, sluggish man at the controls, swaying from side to side...
When she gets the chance, a word on the carousel will be waiting for you on the roof. Drop it in the water.
No one. Just... silence.
The white ceramic sabatons, the long and short of it -- what more could they need? A man's just gotta breathe, right?
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, is standing with his shoulders slightly hunched. Another, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming at her with all his might...
"She keeps it together. On her own. More so than most people do. A little *milieus* in some way. It's kind of a sentiment that people nowadays feel for her."
"Understood. Before we talk to her, though, let's look around."
"Hmm..." She tilts her head. "Maybe not *worried*, but yes. I'm afraid I do, Harry. What else could it be?"
"That's in the, uhm, past."
"Okay." (Give him the tape player.)
A massive hangover.
You ask the driver if he's sure he has enough money for a bribe. He thinks for a moment, then nods and says: "Go ahead, I'll wait."
"Sure thing, poppo, drink your heart out." (Give him the beer.)
What was that about a locked door?
All you hear is static, and the crackle of telephone lines. The lieutenant's voice is uncooperative.
It's some funky acid house shit, but with a weird *afterglow* that makes your brain feel like a jellyfish without its tentacles.
The map features both a motorway and a two way street grid. The two connected together -- you can cross the channel by taking the two additional rail lines running through the heart of the industrial harbour.
An odd-looking fellow... he doesn't seem to fit the rest of the setting.
You're being blackballed.
An infant could see he's stuffed the poor girl down. Perhaps he was trying to stimulate thought processes that don't involve actually finding the bullet?
The dumbfounded man pulls his head back, still trying to catch his breath.
She frowns. "Sorry, I should have gotten you more drunk."
"I'm not afraid."
This is utterly stupid. There is no going back. You will lose!
"No idea, I'm never gonna find my gun... and it's not in here." He picks it up and looks at it in your hands.
I think I know it.
Interesting... I don't see a *spinning* lady beetle in there. I don't even see a spinning lady beetle.
You find no sign of life on the corpse, but there's a significant, red fist in the mouth, and...
He would have a good view of the council members from this angle... they're all a bunch of scared shit.
No, you are quite right. These guys are too scared to talk about their bodies to you -- at least not openly. It would be disruptive to *the process*.
"So you don't need to?"
He thinks for a moment, then nods. "As I said -- regular shit." He looks at you, sighing. "Go ahead, try it again. I won't judge."
You try to keep from shuddering too much, but you can't. This is a woman of the masses, she's not patronizing you.
"There's no need. We're already taking him in." The lieutenant takes the boy in his arms and looks him in the eye. "Kid, this guy's got the biggest heart in all of us. Don't give him a single thing."
She keeps her accent silky smooth but there's an intelligent smile in her voice. A genuine smile. She seems to enjoy herself.
"Okey-doe-doe."
You may not *remember* taking any naps, but you're not going to look in the sleep logs. You're not going to look in those logs. Who knows what lurks in them, beyond what you've read here?
Wasn't he one of the first ones to join the Suzerainty?
"All right," the dicemaker greets you. "It's indescribable."
"What about, jumbo?"
You heard the dad.
It's *an art exhibit*. This man has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.
Look up to the grey sky.
She's probably not used to having his full name associated with him. That's why it's odd he's not accustomed to it...
He adjusts his glasses. "You need medical attention, honcho. You've been drinking for at least a week now -- how long is it before you're no longer incapacitated
But you *know* it's bad.
It's ... you're suffocating with fear.
She blinks at you, mouth slightly open in a strange state. A grimace crosses her face, her eyes long closed. Then she blinks again, voiceless...
"The amazing''. You see the newspaper clipping on the ground in front of the key.
This one is particularly *mind-fucking* to you, he thinks. You're about to un-chain, *un-zlave* him -- into the aloha shed.
No. He doesn't *like* that taskmasters.
So that was the idea. Got something *lighter* in there? You've got nothing to lose.
"Nothing, lorry driver. Our main investigation here has moved on. The tip of the iceberg has gone cold. We'll plug the plant back in. Captain Prokhor Zakhariev will stay on as a security guard for *forever*."
"Kim, please..." The boy looks up at you with pleading eyes.
Sounds like this one. No wonder it's always closing like this...
They wouldn't have heard it anyway. He's gone.
He thinks this "discussion" is somehow personal -- and that you've lost your mind. Leave him be.
"I don't like *entroponetic* travel, but..." He looks around. "You're not hungry. You look *very* hungry, officer."
"'Idiot' is not even a strong enough word. He would have thrown us all out in the street! There was nothing else to do." He seems almost sad to have left this to your judgement.
He's feeling claustrophobic -- confused as to why you're leaving him like this. This *is* very much his doing.
A bad fall. It might have been dark outside? You could swear you saw some kind of flash behind the chimney.
Outside, a sunny monsoon drizzle has fallen onto the asphalt. The plaza is left raised, a dry eternite overlay on top of the former motorway, with new overpasses and a half-submerged motor carriage dominating the boulevards.
No you don't. You're an average human being who has made thousands of decisions and learned facts from them all.
"Piggy," she nods.
Can't dance without the booze. You should be able to get it from Deanna Deneuve or something.
I have no idea. I don't *feel* dangerous, different than when you asked her about the murder.
And it's not over yet, you're a spider web on the inside of a painting. Over half a century at least, a family tree is forming inside of you.
"What? What is this?" He looks at you with amazement. "A new entrant? Never seen anything like that!"
He was anointed by his father, but his claim to fame was short-lived. He was dishonourably discharged from the military after spending ten years in penal servitude...
"My arm... it's gone..."
I have no other choice. All the places I've pointed... Some of them *even* got medals! *All* of them.
You could sneak up to the phasmid and have a closer look? That way you'd have a better chance of hearing it...
"Mr Dros, this is a view from the roof. We're in the reeds -- you need to move your head first. No need to cry..."
The *Remnants* ... remnants of the revolution that nearly brought down the monarchy on Remnant. The bourgeoisie that had the most money and the most bodies.
"I wouldn't have it any other way."
"Aha. The crew gets along, you know, nice. We chat, you and I sometimes, but we also look after each other and..."
"Alright, so what if I *am*?"
There's something's not quite right in your stomach, where you think you've tried so many times...
Two? Maybe three hours?
You carry a flint, a dweorg, a tusk and a few dozen lab rations. The rest you'll need to fill out later.
"I need to discuss this more formally."
In your hands -- a marbling glove forged in the fury of battle. From severed fingers and mangled limbs.
"A man should look after himself."
You have my full cooperation. You are a good man, Harry. You just need *one* thing off -- and you'll be golden.
"Okay. I'll help you with that -- just give me some drugs."
He doesn't want your frail mind caught up in something here -- in this dangerous *zone*.
"Are you telling us the truth?"
Incorrect. He has spent his youth in penal colonies, far from the hustler's paradise of Revachol. While he was growing up, this city was a veritable food desert.
Even now -- you're *the Man with the Stomach](/tg/meme); and even though you're a *pyramid head* you can't go back to asking him about anything.
She squints, looking into the empty contraption. "Is it dangerous? What can I do if I don't follow directions?"
"This isn't about that elf anymore."
He sees the bag in your hand. "Don't be so surprised to hear I crashed into it. Sorry."
The tinctures in the air are different too. The fumes of motor carriages and foot traffic have mingled with the main odour of the store.
"Yeah, nothing. I don't have a garage."
You're right, you're the mediocrity embodied. The mediocre mediocrity. That's who we are, that's us.
"That's part of the problem. Old Fred doesn't speak a lot any more, and his brother Dick... used to lead us into these jams. The two of us drove that Dream team in a pit on the coast and spent our last days partying hard, drinking and smoking..." He makes a note in his notebook.
Don't worry, *bratan*. You're still here. There's a solid ground and a solid roof overhang the whole way around. You can't fall.
I didn't understand a word of that.
It is her life, her reputation, her position in the pecking order. It is part of her mystique.
The *Rene Lavavejes' carabineer* is in the courtyard just east of here. Don't listen to what *you* said -- listen to *THE SOURCE*.
"I'm not sure I understood it."
Could it be a symptom of overdosing on something? Something even you have not tired? Keep your eyes open for it.
"Mack's a real piece of work, but he's a real professional. Very professional. I liked him, he liked me, we even bonded over our *stardom*." He smiles. "I can't remember a single thing about him."
Already heard the Family you rascal! What do you know about this shit? Answer the damn thing already.
This is the dawn of modern physics -- the age of *heroes without hearts*.
A pair of heavy duty boots is lying on the wooden floorboards of the cafeteria. They haven't been used in a while and look completely rusted, but they do the job.
A glorious sight: your body double stretched out on the mat, smiling from ear to ear, the moment you pulled on the trigger. You were a proud owner of the most *impressive* handgun in the world.
NOOOOOO
"Yes, the dirty little secret of the Umbrella... Remember? We wear it around our neck too. Not too far from our little nest of bats. When we're looking at a litter of dead things, we're looking at those people. You know -- *common people*."
His eye lands on the folder. He *knew* from the looks of it* it's communist...
She sighs. "I'm sorry, sweetie. Can't we just keep it behind the counter? That's all I can do. Anyway..."
It has to be said -- a lot of men look at a woman like that and think: he must be suffering, you know? Look at her at her most *angry*.
She sways slowly side-to-side, her eyes narrowed. Something's cut off here -- an instrument for him to play with. What it is, you can't say.
"Haven't we got enough problems now?"
This isn't something you can ask a guy his mum. Ask his dad.
His finger is resting on the digital instrument, studying the water. "It's... a long one, but it's *good* research."
Not interested. [Discard thought.]
Your fist bounces back a great distance, anger and sadness still tender inside. Why didn't you just start hitting yourself?
Not good. Don't keep this any longer than you have to, see if you can talk your way out of this.
His teeth are clenched and his throat moves in a gulping motion. Grotesquely, he attempts to keep it together.
But then it didn't. And the tension is killing
"Bigness is subjective. We all like to become desensitized to it, it seems. But overall, you look like you'd make a pretty good Hardie boy."
When the union took over, Cuno was like, the scruffy-haired youth was right up there with them.
He's almost unfazed by your question. He opens his mouth to say something, then thinks better of it...
I won't. I'll stop now.
"T-the fuck are you talking about?"
That's exactly what Dick Mullen feared when he started the Chateau Rustic. This is where the *Black Terror* would happen...
This guy is suffering from clinical depression. Lives are at stake. Show him you're tough as nails.
He has also been betrayed by his closest aide and betrayed twice himself.
Being an antiques enthusiast, you overhear a conversation between the seller and a pawnbroker. The pawnbroker is about to pawn the item off for a pittance. The ledger owner overhears this and angrily shouts at the merchant...
On the islet? There is almost no wind, just the light movement of the light reflected off the glass sliding sides...
The belt is soaking wet. The metal buckle glimmers, catching the raindrops as they tumble down the length of the chain.
She laughs. "Barry the Butcher is a real killer, I've been shot at twice. Once by the police and once by the terrorists."
"I was there too, remember? They had the big screen and all. It was real scum up there. The real stuff."
Could this be why the World Court is so interested in the case of *Everlasting Marching* in Martinaise?
"I'd advise not talking about the dress, officer. You look like you'd be more at home in a... disco place or something."
The lieutenant does not answer the provocation. "It's just that we don't want to rob you. Besides, at least a dozen people are in there -- maybe more, it's hard to tell at first. They're... crazy."
In the middle of the khazar, in the dark of the past, you see a young woman. Dark circles under her eyes, on the hollow meridian. Her slender, cheerful features are obscured by that ghastly make-up. In a small window you see her, in the warm morning light of the early morning.
The steel bracelet glimmers under your fingertip. There is a slight tinge of purple in it's centre.
The stew is getting sicker by the second. You should stop racking your brains, or else it will make things worse down the line.
She quietly corrects her black shoes.
That's bad. He's a good officer. And a good man. But he's got no one to blame but himself for not stopping this madman.
"I've been on both ends of the scale. Revachol has always been on the other end of the spectrum."
Hey, by asking you to move your things we could help you with something else."
"I'm not saying it wasn't me. I'm just saying -- these romantic notions do not express anything deep in my soul."
Oh, you mean now? After she's gone for *five minutes*?
He's focused on nothing more than clearing his throat.
Good decision.
This must be the infernal machine that tore you from oblivion.
When his friend returns, the armored man looms over him... watching you approach the little townsfolk with your *statuettes*.
The elders would make a much more ridiculous version.
"Officer..." the shopkeep looks at you with fear and concern.
"And then you slept in it. In a trash container, like
The book contains very little information on the case, though it's made very clear that Wade and his men are trustworthy.
Your voice echoes on the water. No one answers the call.
Think about it.
"Of course, Harry! Of course you're enjoying this. What else is out there? I guess I don't care about its physical part, I care about your artistic side." He rolls his eyes, then looks at the bundle of tape in front of him.
The pole has been carefully cut, the wooden planks, stacked on top of each other. The wind blows...
This is another one of Thylaköp's tricks. He knows you can't trust him on this -- no one can trust a primate.
"Now, let's talk about something else."
She smiles at the corpse, waving her hand, as if to say: *Let's go then*.
"Oh, okay." He waves you off. "How does that sound?"
Turn the key.
The partition separates
A warm wave passes him. He's wearing flip-flops, and a hat with no apparent political significance.
"I'm telling the truth. It was ignorance. I was hungry and the
Maybe you can... just stop saying it?!
He sincerely thinks it's pretty, but he doesn't know how to present it to a manager of the *pale imitation* club.
The man pauses to think. "I don't know. Some people would say it's more patriotic than revolut... But I always thought it was a *move* -- and that's what it is." He tilts his head to the left.
"Did you have a tape of it?"
"Titus," Kim answers for you.
Look at your feet.
You can't say. You should just ask her. Ask her about that ex-lover thing and the tiny little house on the coast.
Doesn't sound like it's going to be a very long time before we know who the real *Xerife* is. Perhaps a suspect could be laid out next to Evrart?
"Hey, Kim, are you sure you're not being *sexually* harassed?"
"Well, let me know if you're ever down with a little *objectionable* cop show commentary. Leave it empty."
"Door, Room #1. Can you hear me?"
Your liege isn't the only one mourning the passing of a favorite. The lieutenant's unusually lenient approach might be to blame too...
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what's real? Who's really in control here? Or are you just spending your time *analyzing* this one tiny thing?
These statements give off a sense of urgency, like a gun. His fingertips touch his temple and his neck...
Yes. The seagull does fly in the sea, actually looks like a reed.
"Maybe if you're *sarcastic*..." He stares down the barrel of his pistol. "What are you saying?"
For a moment the lorryman seems to be suppressing a fearful smile. Then he clears his throat...
Lies. Slurp them,  this may be a super weird episode...
This message is an example of Relay 9 -- a specialized message, sent from a computer somewhere in *ROW* with the intention of reaching every node in the system (including yourself) in the coming days or weeks.

Almost forgot something important.

The one you're looking for probably isn't an official Kineema. Even if it were, it wouldn't be legal in Revachol West.
So it's not a fascist now, is it? A pretty decent man who isn't a fascist?
Well, *bratan* might be a bit harsh on them, isn't he? What he means is that a) they're children of the Attisburgh and b) weren't really feeling great when he said they killed themselves.

Damn, you dropped the ball there. One bad decision could cost you the race. Make it right and you might be back in the peloton in two minutes...

"I think I have *drouamine* in me, pig."
She's not ruling out the shot coming from here -- just pointing out that there's nothing to see here.
"And now you're saying..."
While you daydream about speed, the lieutenant has something in his shoulder: the missing pipe.
"Something like that -- doesn't feel like anyone I know."
She is leaving you no choice in the matter. She will not be bribed by any means -- she will NOT let you leave without the full amount.
He's only making a verbal approximation. He knows what's coming.
Hey, so the bad times are real. The people who ran it weren't, and you didn't.
(Whisper.) "It's very okay."
That *copyrighted* stuff doesn't fit with your version of the story. You can't be both a *cop* and a *free thinker* at the same time.
He doesn't have the stamina to do this kind of thing on his own. You have to be more forceful.
"MISCONDUCT WITH A GUN," he nods approvingly. "MISCONDUCT WITH A GUN, *MISCONDUCT WITH A GUN!*"
So what is this? This... family drama? You can't even *think* about phasmid without it sounding racist.
Your hand moves on the boom horn. It's getting weaker... but it *still* has not found what you're looking for.
Or is it? Looks like someone carved out a small *meeting place* in the jungle. Just for show's sake... No one heard you come here.
Nothing, everything, ever. The fractal structure of reality is a funny bastard.
Nothing can stop me now.
He waves his hand, as though the bones of some ancient city were cast into the sea, and then again, and the impression is misleading.
"I wasn't even telling you anything about the black spirit."
This seems to be some kind of workshop. For fixing up damaged motors -- the kind of thing most CEOs do.
To me that's a weapon, a weapon for me to use against her. For self-defence against someone who's more than a little rough on you...
"That's right. Poetic whimsy. And it's here -- in the poor, brown hills of West Mañana. The most wretched part of the peninsula. And it's everything we've been looking for..."
"I'm not saying it doesn't *count* -- it's the *capital* of the world. The greatest capital ever discovered."
They have different priorities and priorities are more important than you might think.
Loving it. So very cool.
"Yeah. You bet, pig. You won't even miss that delicious skull any more."
You hear the pandemonium in the audience -- a cacophony of sounds, all muffled, carried on the breeze.
You have her as an enemy sovereign. It would be unthinkable for a *normal cop* to get involved.
The reeds continue to hiss around you as you take the red-dyed ammunition into the gun compartment.
Somewhere in the bowels of the old whale is a smoking man drinking hard, chewing gum. In his hand: a small pouch of cigarettes.
You're using the very last of your strength to get through this. The gruff man has his hands up, he's looking at you with the most serious eyes.
What does she look like?
"Got it. Was there anything else?"
"What do you mean 'maybe'? I don't think I could have let him speak any more freely before he..."
So that's why his favourite thing is his *time machine*. He was more used to seeing Paperno.
Those assholes haven't *only* got your wallet *close* to your skin, they've got it *lame* and they're always ruining it.
Not even *lightly*. The suspension of disbelief *is* ridiculous. You'll never be able to perform a 360-degree spin on it.
He gestures with his beer can -- imagine if you could use your hands and feet to build something holy, holy city of gods?
"Hey, I could really use some socks."
The lieutenant takes out his notes.
She looked like a *figure* to him. Tall and thin, with long blonde hair and a splash of makeup.
SAY THE SOLUTION! We'll give you a one time chance to get back to *doing* things, not worrying about *what* you said last week. *If* you say it loud enough, it will *sound*!
This character, for all his nerve damage, must feel like *actually* solid bonds.
Maybe it's the hangover talking, maybe it's him, maybe he just doesn't know -- it's all *bad*, but there's something else hiding in this mess...
Thousand years later: You are a citizen of Graad. You wield the full akakia double-barrelled rifle, issued to specially commissioned police officers. You are a citizen of the *old world*. You travel throughout the temporal continuum, the Material Realm, the Supernatural...
"Have you ever even *attended a rally*?"
The one with the large head is still looking at you, nodding along to his music, waiting for your body to start moving...
And a little something for yourself as well. Maybe you should choose a side and look for it. Along the way?
Sounds like it's being played back on a split-scale, like a piece of vinyl. A strange choice of equipment, to be honest.
His evil twin, on the other hand...
You're being *neglected* on the most important decision of your life. Whether you like it or not. The choice is yours, you're an activist hunter and you got this.
It's hard to make out if he really believes this or not -- this man has clearly done his best to spin it -- but he *probably* does.
The lieutenant's right -- it's useless without the boots. You should start taking it off, *now*.
"Oh, I'm very sorry, sweetie. I'll never get around to it again. And it's just
She was *framed* -- illegally -- with someone from *exile* who somehow acquires control of the relic you held. This is the Resurrected Man!
He smiles. "They'll have to live with themselves if they throw me out on the balcony, I'm afraid."
Don't say you're not worried. *Don't* say it, it's for show. We'll rip into him for the pain he's in right up, starting with this *cock carousel*.
She smiles at you. "Don't count on it, Harry. You're still the... uhm... uhm... *cop* here."
This book *conclusively* proves that Klaasje was present at the crime scene and that Deneuve was there as well.
I'm sorry. (Accept the irony.)
"Yes, I'm sure I'm just as wonderful and *mysterious* as you."
"Wait... *how* did you get there?"
Your body is ready. You have the heart of an army and the will to go toe to toe with the vampire king.
"Me neither." She looks across the water, where the skysc
"No, I don't like this *corrupt system*. It keeps me down." She's chit-chatting with the lieutenant.
When this district was booming, the rezenn-bite was so extensive, the ion storm-borne radio used to travel great distances -- miles even -- to connect to the harbour.
Yes, yes, *bratan*! Yes, *bratan*! You should indulge in some childish fantasies about crawling around on the ceiling or whatever... you don't have to do anything. Just lie there.
God, I don't know... sounds kind of stupid. Especially when you consider all the things that could go wrong...
Just like that it's over -- your mortal coil has never more *sway* than 1/4 of an inch in her locks.
"You might as well take the whole thing off."
"No, it wasn't that." He nods. "At all. A normally functioning organisation is one in which its directors are responsive to its shareholders and its executives provide the company with the value it deems necessary at the expense of its shareholders."
"A liar?" He just shakes his head, immediately serious.
He stares at you, bloodshot eyes. "Could you come with me to the building? We need to examine that surveillance room."
And then it hits you -- it's coming to *YOU*! You're a born preacher, capable of speaking truth to power. Be part of the new era of REVACHOL!
I have limited information about the victim's state of decomposition at the time of her death. I do know she was found with her limbs broken, her torso mostly decomposed, and her head mostly infested with worms.
I bet you're stupid not to be.
It *is* a cold, funny thing about those shoulders: too funny for workshops, but not for you. You just can't help it.
You seem to have created a substantial *sphere* of difference by standing in the apricot-coloured light of the window. Colour blind? You could probably peel off the white half of the mural -- and the mural would be unrecognizable.
Is it just me or is it intense?
You might be able to carry him through a moderate heart attack.
"Who'd want to be more romantic about it?" She lights up. "I'm glad you got this."
The tank is a tile-covered piece of industrial terrain in the middle of the map, covering the entirety of the city blocks from Revachol West to Jamrock Quarter. It is the backbone of the defensive perimeter, protecting the water lock's vital entrance points...

Scab leader's advice...
"Hhnnngh..." the jolly man stares at you, visibly grim. "I think you blew this whole thing wide open."
You can't force the dead man to speak, keep him from just blowing his brains out. He's not going to, no matter what you tell him.
Just think about it... You've never been on *that* boat. There was never a time when you weren't a member of their exclusive club.
You know, they look very convincing together. The black boots and the elaborate web of bonds.
"It's really something, but I'll have you know I have *no idea* what you're talking about."
"The helisopter is one of the aircraft types that the RCM uses. It has two fixed flight surfaces and two rotors."
It's true: you're a *näkk*.
Wow. *The Hardie boys* are gonna be in charge. This is gonna be okay.
Why is he asking?
A fading web of tattoos covers his chest and shoulders. His hair is grey, filtered by a flinch.
She nods. "I think they are quite polite not to disrupt our *special moment* by bringing the media in."
It's important to realize that all of this was all part of an elaborate plan. Not that Cunoesse didn't know it.
But wait, there's more!
He does *not* resent you stealing his thunder -- it's meant as an expression of sincere respect.
She's right, she would scream if you tried to pull her along, even though you've done it a hundred times.
With an ominous, if slightly panicked ring, he's still not satisfied with your performance.
He's just annoyed.
Whoa... *Another* nerve center. By now it's probably in your head, constantly reminding you that you have no idea where your nerve endings are.
There is very little wind here today. The only thing to do is wait for the tides to recede and cleanse the streets. Revachol West, today -- tomorrow.
An entire row of chairs has been assigned to a side-table. Two tables sit on the bench, one on which lies a rather prominent neon orange drink. On it -- a rectangular plastic cup sits neatly topped with a rattle. In it, some kind of a botanically useful drug has just been added...
Hey, I'm from the law, he's the one who has to pay...
Just walk away. [Leave.]
A lot of *can*'ers don't say they were *penned* -- they were cornered into signing. A lot of them renege on their fiduciaries.
No one. All of this sudden silence. It must be the seagull.
If the lieutenant were a *player*, he'd be here for this. He'll even give you a free game!
A neverending story.
A false sense of security, created by your recent activity in Martinaise.
Feels so smooth, like you evaporated some of that sweet-sweet soap-free instant that was left on the counter.
You hold the key, the light red nerve-agent in your hand glows, casting shadows on the wall. The one you picked up says: 'Tequila. By the way, *what* -- do you remember?
He's really, really trying to seem nonchalant about this. This is like his first-ever day of *detective work*.
He's exhausted and angry at the world, too. The fight is inside his chest, fighting his heart out.
He does *not* understand the complications of a missing gun.
"It's as you said, a 'little further down the coast we still have to perform the field autopsy. There's more work to be done at the crime scene as well..." He looks at you with mild interest. "I'll let you and Kim
He is. His *excellency* knows. And he's going to do what has to be done.
He stops to consider your words. "Maybe this is why Evrart sent someone else to spy on you -- a vendetta."
The lieutenant holds a piece of milled aluminium. It's taped to the door frame. "The door is *always* locked. Only the key is inside."
"I'm not really feeling it -- not that I'd know otherwise."
"We need to get him on the ground as soon as possible. This has been a public safety hazard." (Give him a look.)
It's as if he's pining after some lost love... Lost love... Could this be why Ravenous isn't here? Night Terrors?
She has created an almost idiotic carbon monoxide complex. It's going to be hard to beat her.
Her braided cigarette remains in the palm of her hand as she appraises the change in atmosphere.
These are all boring. Boring third-rate shit-heels thrown out by the shop owner when they realized the cops work there.
Really? Your life story told you that you should have... ? You should have *The Expression*... but you've never had it... maybe it's too late?
As it ought to be. This is one of the grand challenges facing the species in the Anthropocene.
And keep him from dying, it seems. All he can see is the gleam of headlights as the man falls onto his side, his head dropping between the hands.
"For years he's been bragging about the *skulls* he had. When I found out, I was in a hurry."
Trouble? No one believes you, which is *bad*. But don't worry, your mind is *tight* now. There's plenty to say. Plenty of questions.
They're all fuckin' crazy, sire. If he doesn't stop saying these things, I'll *have* to.
With a sickening *click*, echoing off the walls of the Great District of UQOL, the name "Jesse James" appears before you.
"If I recall, it's... uhm, strange. I just felt like it was what I'd set out to do."
What about *you*? They wouldn't be able to hear anything if you said that now. Maybe if you turn the radio back on while it's on...
His eyes follow your movements with some concern. "Yes, officer. You look -- very well -- like a mad man."
The portareel is actually the remnant of a research and development project undertaken by Revachol's electric company. The remains of the "Exeter" are reflected in the blue plastic.
Even though we're from the same station, we don't have the same driver...
"I dunno, man... I don't know."
You can't dance because your body can't reach the floor. Maybe if you lie about your age, this could work...
"Does it have anything to do with my stomach ache?"
You're right, beautiful things do make people happy...
"Wait, what's a... *diaphragm*?"
Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau is a wine-and-biscuit joint.
"What, you're just gonna let it go, huh? You're gonna let *anything* get out, huh?"
The room gets a full workout as they stare at the colourful figurines -- trying to decide what to do with the huge bins.
You don't feel like either one of these things -- you know what your name is. You have a sophisticated name. Like that of a count. Or a beautiful man.
"I'm just telling a joke here, okay?"
Exactly! The bread's baked, sire. 'Tis but a scribbl on the back of a piece of medical waste paper -- *you* left it out in the rain. How can it be?
The air islets are mesmerizing. Their silent, almost subliminal state isalo? Do you want more *pats*? More *belongs* to the world?
He chuckles. "Don't take your shirt off, sweetie. It's cold out here. Don't let the lieutenant see you with the blindfold on..."
Evrart said the stick insect was her "army animal." Could it be the loop laser pointer he points at in his head? Or just your imagining? You should really ask him about that.
That's not surprising. Something like the umbilical cord probably comes up on a lot of occasions.
A shop window?
The cold feels painfully familiar. It's the Day of Departure.
And booze. Lots of it. Especially hard core vodka. Makes you paranoid.
The dog barks, but you hear nothing. The whirr of seagulls against the wind is oddly calm.
You glance over your shoulder. The Man from Hjelmdall watches you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.
It's hard to say. He stands there like a statue. His jaw is clenched and his head is twitching.
"Me neither, though."
The lieutenant says nothing but nods. His face follows the jacketed bullet pattern.
No, of course not. Rock-solid proof of your existence will probably come in handy later -- when you have to present it.
But it was all prelude to the *disintegration* of the world that would follow. After the great cataclysm, after the world plunges into eternal darkness, the re-emerging Möther Academy is a drug den of the first order. Dangerous, to
He closes his eyes and seems satisfied with the joke.
Your hand moves, smooth and lightning-fast, to the upper right corner of the screen...
Doing some *good* will alleviate the hangover. Soon you will be back in the golden world of drunks!
Your voice echoes on the water. The lieutenant watches you do it, too busy trying not to see the peephole.
Hard to say, it's gone now. A small tear forms on her sorrow-stricken face: "You took me for a fool when you gave the order."
Looks like the hand has loosened up from the massive blow. The index finger of the old man still has a little nail there...
"How? I was an under-achiever, a failure of a police officer."
Titus makes a mental note to write down that he doesn't think there's anything to discuss.
[Put away the stranger.]
The lieutenant stares at you, still stunned. The cool has vanished
Downstairs somewhere -- or into the boiler upstairs? You know it would be dangerous to leave tracks in the snow.
He likes the technical part. This *gift* comes from his profession.
"Lightsaber, four-barrelled. A long-distance, manufactured by Revachol-based HJK-Revachol..."
Idiot Cop, the cop who lied to you.
"Shall we go and mail it?" The lieutenant looks at the package in your hands.
The door has still moved slightly in your hand. Not a little, but...
"There's nothing to see here, I just threw a wrench into the works," she says after taking a bit of a long time to collect her thoughts.
It would be *clever* of him to omit a last detail. There's something he doesn't want you to know.
Nothing is happening, just muscle memory and dopamine.
Seriously? Because of that? No. It's probably some kind of love... Or was it political? He could be indifferent. Look at all these guys come together for some *nuts* sake...
Such men have none other than *The Expression*.
"I see it, Kim, but I'm not the *theoretical* type."
"Go ahead." She shakes her head slowly. "Here we go again -- c'mon. Tell me what you think of the headmasters."
Oh yes. You were too close to the edge a while back, you need to get over it. But you're not strong enough to pull it off right now.
The great district hums in the wind: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the firetraps...
That might be a good idea. You've grown a lot in those lapses.
This *Solar Impulse* is powered by a rechargeable battery, basically a tiny battery bank stuffed into a fridge-safe compartment under the seat.
The city of Revachol stands above the broken plaza, like a beacon in the dark. The air islet it's surrounded by a faint *cancellation*, like a black yearning...
"They were on a date! And it turned out to be a *gimmick*. They *had* to knock on everyone's doors, but also used some old military equipment."
You need to talk to him! You need to tell him you're looking into this. This is the last thing he's thinking.
You're doing it! Sneaking past them like that. Just like you did with the Dex and the Pile. The hangover will get you, the drugs will keep you from falling into this pit.
But I'm not gonna get personal with her, I'm not gonna *engage* in this conversation at all, it's pointless and I don't want to waste my time.
As you look to the dark shadow the Feld building, looming over the yard... It's hard to see if it's too dark for you to see in.
He nods. "He'll live."
"Officer... what if it were your partner? What if she was still out there, doing something, when you got here?"
God damn it, try something else. You can't remember what the answer is...
These are all boring, bimbo-bimbos, a bunch of trash... what's a few coins on your life?
Another solitary garbage truck slams into the side of the building next to the Kineema, crushing it under its magnetic levitation. All that's left is to confront the world once more.
Exactly! You're *exactly* what the doctor ordered: a vasectomy with two thousandths of a millilitre of alcohol in it. The fuck do you need, 'her'?
An old rusty ladder leads to the roof of the shack. It's rusting and falling apart.
"WTF is that?!" she yells, obviously enraged. "Who's the stupidest cop I've ever seen?! He's a *f******t* and a f******t is a f******t! You're not part of the *community* -- you're part of the pig unit!"
"I've heard of *näkki* -- a mysterious tribe of fierce wildmen in western Croatia."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You cannot but notice the reflection of your face in it -- namely, a regular *kebab* under the cone-shaped hut that serves as your home.
With surprising persistence you unroll the plastic. Inside the box, an ornate cover artfully depicts a mass of grinning labourers loading goods onto a conveyor. The title reads: 'Man from Hjelmdall in the Lost City of the Pygmies.'
"I don't know -- sounds like some sexist language."
Even when you get the case solved, and *done* you should still be looking at this wall, smoking, like a bum.
"Good shit, officer." She smiles, amused. "You seemed dazed."
He sighs and looks into his cup. "It would be too silly, though. Too childish. Not very important."
The plaque is affixed to the outside wall of the two-by-four. It's been there for a while -- you should have taken it.
"It's just this machine."
The lieutenant nods. "Excellent work, detective. This
The bookstore... the book store... the fucking elevator -- it's not for living, it's for talking, so don't ask what's for sleeping.
Is that an airship? Are they *together* now?
"So what do you say to the hell-soldier..." the big guy asks. "Do *you* still want to take part in this *thing*?"
"I have such respect for these men."
It's odd, because the RCM itself was built with very specific requirements in mind: it must be able to function efficiently, independently of the lieutenant's oversight.
It's not easy. He has 0.00001% on the street. But you *get* behind his back. Sometimes it's better to take the initiative.
She's not okay with it. It's a big moment.
What's interesting about this odd goose is clear to see. The goose is trying to tell you something, but you can't quite put your finger on it.
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror at the fourth, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
The lead programmer turns and gives you a look that indicates he doesn't think you'll be most comfortable on the job.
"This is insane, Jean. Not a minute goes by and you just keep saying..." she looks around. "You've got to go on that road trip, you've got to go see that crazy scenery a hundred times now. It's a *journey*. You know."
As you've already determined, the lo Manse is responsible for quite a few things in Martinaise.
"We don't have time for *social justice* issues. Let's talk about what we need to do here."
"Okay, fine. I understand."
You carry the sticky notes in your hand and shuffle them around in your head. You feel vaguely dizzy.
LOOK AT ME, I'VE A DEATH-LIAM IN MY HEAD
"So much for asking." She snorts. "Fuck it... I'm not making any moral apologies for my job, officer."
He still is -- only marginally -- able to comprehend the situation, but he's changing his tune.
"Because you were drunk too."
Your grip on reality tightens up.
Think! Think! Think! The song of a man without a woman... The one who never spoke, the picture doesn't *have* to be perfect.
"I'd be happy to help if you two work together." She shrugs. "So did I. You two got a good laugh here, Titus?"
I'm sorry I didn't catch it sooner. It took my mind off the dope for a moment.
"And this is *where* it is!" He points to the islet. "With the reeds. The island's bait, sir. All this is out there. Look -- it's *out there*."
He pauses, thinking. "It all depends on what the exact numbers are, but... mine is a one way trip. If it *were* a one
"I haven't changed my name in *twelve years*," he says wistfully. "At least not on paper. My full name -- Tequila Sunset -- is still Tequila Sunset. I can't even remember my full name anymore. I'd just call myself that."
In the medicine cabinet, behind the glass, a blister pack is filling a pill bottle. Not you... Dead men don't talk, but you *do*.
A small, terrified smile quivers on her face as she takes the keys from the ashtrays and hands them to you: "Please keep them safe."
A book that's out of print. A replica of a textbook called "Animal Husbandry", and the title "Animal Husbandry" are stamped on its front. The back says: "To be sure -- this isn't the *final* final volume in the Petrie series."
"I don't think I'm getting enough credit for all these years."
Yeah, no. That's not it.
You catch the child off guard. No fury there.
Under the noonday sky the great district hums: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron
Sounds like he has a lot of money -- and he wants to give it to you. Be careful with him, though. He might be richer than he thinks.
Okay. Guess.
"Fine by me, fine by you," he whispers. He stands up. "Today is officially the *day* I have to tell you, *lie*."
If there is a thing to learn from an officer of the RCM, it's that little thing he says to *you*. Don't ask him to explain himself. Ask him ask herself.
Just like that, instinct took over -- a sense of impending danger washed over you. Grab the handle and start rotating it around!
"Like a true DJ." He looks to the building behind him and nods in agreement.
The word lingers in the air of the chambers, as time slowly progresses. It's the *last exclamation* of the poet.
"You're saying I've lost my mind?"
As if you'd just taken the bra off the dude in the striped raincoat.
Your words echo in the dark like distant drums. Not a sound is heard when the lightning disconnects the cutters from the branch above the barrel.
"You mean the manager?"
He feels bad about it. About his friend leaving him. But he *knows* not to worry, because he's A). a cop and B). a sniper.
You *are* a police detective. It's not your call to be picking up litter and drinking stiff. Don't take it.
Worse... where it's dark inside. You cannot see through the tower's dark heart.
It's hard to say. All you can make out is that the upper half of the ring is filled with drying ocean mud, while the lower half appears to be asphalt.
You keep finding new ways to wreck people's lives. I should probably find out what these *other guys' lives are like...
He smiles at you again. "Don't worry, lieutenant. It'll be all right. We're all in this together. Don't worry."
He thinks it's *awful* how *non-existent* his eyes are. In some faraway place of the cold sea...
Oh, no no no no no no no no no...
"How would you know?"
...then pulls the trigger.
He would then have little choice but to follow your orders without question. As it should. He's under your wing, all the time.
Nothing to do with this. Talk about the fuckatoo and its *relationship* with yout little abject right now. You've been talking about these things all along. Then we go on, maybe even off-air...
How about you start taking proper notes on the case? It's like you've forgotten you're even here...
"Good. And why would you be hiding out here, officers?" He glances at his notebook and smiles. "Let's move."
But she loves them. Why?
You look around. The light of the hallway is just dim enough for you to make out the little book store on the corner.
"In all likelihood, yes. This is what happened to the brand."
The girl keeps laughing. "Oh, *so*! You must be kidding, right? You don't have *the* camera, officer! You just don't have *the*... Shit, you don't have *the* fucking cash...
Of course it's nothing. Just nod.
The lieutenant takes out his notes. "Are you sure there's no rush?" he mouths to himself silently.
"It's easier said than done, I'm
"Don't know. I don't talk to him much."
"Yes. I'm on the board."
Toot-toot! The wild west is where the guns have been kept, you imagine. Guns have been pointed at cars and at each other.
You do feel there's a connection here, somewhere between the bullet holes and the jacket. The bracelet...
She won't mind sharing it with you, different cops need different assistance in some situations.
"No. We're not buying any more shiny toys."
It's not hard to see at all. You find yourself in her lukewarm embrace, with your eyes closed. You feel warm and reminded of yourself, somehow. Then you think better of it...
"A-ha, but there you were -- surrounded by such a mass of perfectly good people. Truly an inspiration to humanity."
There is a sigh of relief crackling over the noise. There's light in the cabin now...
An indulgent, elderly man. Over the smell of rot and dark green snuff magazines.
It's a relief to finally do this. Maybe the *intimate* part will be a little less *rudimentary* than the *material* part?
"Can't you see I'm having fun?"
"Hundred and twenty, I think."
"I don't know... 2 points to go?"
You should have a look at that window... you wouldn't want to look at the picture just sitting there.
Now *that* is intriguing. You had them open the vault.
How you can so beautifully summarize the complicated emotional roller coaster that is your life, especially when your partner's gone, your mind can only conjure up a few images and a handful of sentences...
His eyes glaze over. "But... what happened to Reinhold. What if he doesn't want to talk about it? We could talk about... whatever it was, it couldn't be more than two minutes ago."
He's been talking about this for a while now: "I'm sorry, but..." He pauses. "I don't know what you should do, either. Just tell me what you did."
After what seemed like an eternity of silence, he speaks again: "Yes. It's a mistake to linger, I'm afraid. The lieutenant isn't the right person to talk to about this... You should ask if there's anything else."
Wait, what if I told you the secret to cracking this case is to just *not* buy cocaine?
You *give* them the drug money. Let them get high. Then leave them hanging out in the alley.
Write: E50.50
That's understandable. Someone who's gone through so much doesn't want their past to stand in the way of them wanting to get better.
He was *just* about to head home that day. Back to Jamrock, back to the hedonistic golden joy.
Your nose does *not* believe you can smell fresh blood in the air.
It'll come off like a riddle: You got stitches, that's why you can't concentrate. Save us the trouble of trying to memorize details, drink!
The lieutenant nods at the woman, then gives you a satisfied smile.
"Does it look like you've been smoking *some* lately, Harry?" The big man puffs on his cigarette.
You're right. Why say it if it doesn't feel like *it*?
Manipulated his patriotic feelings.
Tell her, it was a dream. You wanna hear the thing you were having before?
Hah! Hyperacusis -- hyper-acusis! You'd be like the tiniest of devils if you didn't have that devil to deal with.
You're right, it's impossible. But you *did* see a little shadow of a ghost. A *black shadow*.
The scruffy-haired youth smiles, happily. "I'm not sure, but we should talk about it -- the thing that killed you was indecisive, we should not talk about it now."
The big guy stares at you, still stunned. "I don't even understand what you're saying, detective."
The shadow of a crenel, cast into the deep of the woods by the retreating Union's guns.
He goes on: "It wasn't a coincidence. I always said... Be careful of what you wish for, sire. Sometimes it comes, sometimes it doesn't."
Even if it means hurting the local animal, you're definitely going to have to give it a chance.
Just like that it's over -- the mechanic's hands are on the tool, the two poles of the pole gun engaging each other...
"Hold on, how would I get a copy? It's not on sale."
Get the fuck outta here!
"Excuse me, what's the Funky Town?"
"No..." He lowers his head, heavily.
What you are describing is a severe case of the hangover / excessive - and not because you're bored. You don't want to hear about *that one* just yet.
"Okay." She takes the photo and hands it back to you.
You hear him tense up.
Old South. In backyards and on stoops and in front of grain elevators, children play with guns. North, on the coast, on Ferdydyrke and in La Delta -- at the roundabout, where the reeds grow wild and the winding streets disappear. On Martinaise, where the wind calls.
How many different approaches could you think of?
At first, the mechanical arch is impressed by your receptiveness. But then it gives up, and you feel dirty, somehow.
All you can come up with is *bad news* -- what would happen if someone said they were an *individual who's done time*.
So, you see, it's sometimes difficult to be a detective in this day and time. But don't let that stop you from doing your job -- detective, fire fighter, all those things -- it's important.
"Then why are you so sure it's not me?"
"Good thing we're here, too, Titus."
The girl keeps her blanket over her ears, closed her eyes, and lets out a sweet little napalm smoke.
A few bricks have fallen off, revealing a compartment behind the wall. It's too dark to see in.
"What's my story, by the way?"
A woman's voice...?
"Who would have guessed?" He stops. "You're drunk as *fuck* and you can't tell me what to do..."
"Tell me something else about her."
As you've already determined, the actual number is 216 -- but what's a few more nano-second accuracies to a chronobot?
She doesn't mean to make you feel better -- she merely means she doesn't have money for a lawyer.
"In the meanwhile, we should investigate the possible route of a bullet taken to the head. If we find a gun that matches the murder weapon, we should turn him over to your organisation
A cold gust of air drizzles down your side, making the great thermobaric expanse in the north feel like an arctic oasis.
No, you don't stick around. You leave *now*!
Turn on the machine.
It's alright, you don't have to make a scene. There are plenty of police officers around.
"I am not joking. There was a blunder at the West-Insular Press. The writers never even learned how to write a story..." She sighs. "So we were forced to improvise."
What you have to do now is fight the fake fights! Like you always wanted to. Pick up the phone, use it to call Ellis. Talk to him -- sounds like fun. Then mail the signed declaration to Victor. Then call him again and repeat the question:
The corpse is bloated with soggy rags. In its place you find more rotten food -- a rotting skewer of a melon clutched tight by a fingernail.
No, seriously, what are you talking about? Nothing. Just sleepy eyes. Get back to that.
You sense a thread running through the narc, telling you something important. A thread that you can *NOT* hear...
You've been talking to *Ruby*, the Grease Monkey, that Ruby?! This is some seriously bad news.
"Right, yeah, because I have my addiction to booze and I need some money."
(Cough, hiccup...) "Yes, I can't. Maybe it's dark outside?"
It would be *exactly* what it was -- a trifle over the moon.
They probably already are. You just need to stand in one place and *forcibly* walk all over it.
("We're running out of transports. This is our final post. Whatever you do, do not get in another car.")
From the mouth of a frog: "Tequila... Tequila! You should've seen the clouds on the horizon. They seem to be receding. In the distance, Motive Radio is operating..."
Listen to him. At the most fundamental level -- your sociopathic nature is un-corroborated. There is no such thing as a *corroborated* case.
"Right, my turn."
He could go for a little booze when he comes to, it's not a bad place to start.
"What if you missed the bullet, yes?"
Wait for the moment to pass.
He repeats: "I can't tell you'll be fine. This is a terribly uncomfortable time for a police detective to be discussing this sort of thing."
Your fingers move on the remote, but there is no dial. Only the tape moves, as the buttons have an ordered sound.
You're a detective. And a little curious.
There seems to be. An *extra* special guest here. Only the one you were supposed to meet.
Maybe this is a good idea?
"You told me you were feeling suicidal. I can hear you now -- I'm sorry." (Give the sandwich back to Andre.)
Maybe you should take it easy then. Don't push her too.
The kid looks at him like he's trying to put the world in scare quotes.
She has a direct view to the roof at the back of the building. The wind moves the cigarette butts around her mouth.
"You do realize that people in this business don't *just* punch in to confirm job offers, do they?" He chortles.
First of all, there's no way that's true. Second -- it would have been very unusual for it to still be in your handwriting.
Just face it. That's who you are.
There's a *finger* on the lock...
"Like the cadaver? Yes, a great, magnificent cadaver!" He's beyond happy about this. "Get him *back*."
What did he just call you? Wow, did you get *boring* today? You must have an overwhelming hangover to be lugging around all by yourself.
Somewhere in Mirova a mournful song comes from the speaker.
What if it were, really?
They must have gotten the wrong door. The owner must have lost patience and was forced to defend his or her rights.
He's playing us the part of the great potential mega-sethe which he himself described as the *most valuable* gem on earth. Be careful -- that's *one* more thing he wants you to worry about.
Okay. I can see that.
The girl looks at you with tender concern. "Don't be sad, man. You're one of the ones who can help Ghost Rider -- you know how it is..."
He doesn't know anything.
If you play it again, you'll find it much harder to concentrate. Try to concentrate instead -- the game will be lost.
Silence. The wind outside picks up with a faint howl.
I like it, but can't we get into the other stuff first?
"I see. And when did you tell me you're looking for Evrart?"
Wait... that would fit the photo.
The act, as performed, has brought great joy and happiness to Graad and the western part of the Insulindian phylum, as well as to Insulinde and the Graad coast.
Not I.
"Yes, it's the great, un-ful
What more can you say?
Could it be all my fellows have failed? Whom might we have failed to notice? Perhaps you *are* experiencing it?
Wow. Now there's nothing for him -- more questions!
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a dove lands on your bonfire. It is warm and surprised at first, but then it settles down to rest on the ground with a soft thump.
The smile on his face remains unchange -- the moment has passed.
Because you're not fucking stupid, *polizon* is actually a vehicle codified in law.
"He was definitely high. I know it's a little cliché, but I'm talking big-time drug trafficking here."
"It's okay, I'll stay. Things are bad, I see it in your eyes."
"Because we're mammals, aren't we?"
Perhaps you could interpret the beast's post-mortem message in your head? Still, a strange dissonance comes over you: some older man was high on speed, but all of it *went down* in your head.
"Did she?" The lieutenant leans closer.
There is no room for *grins* in his manly mouth. Retort to him, compliment him on his attire, but otherwise keep it light.
Sounds of the sea. He's nodding too, thoughtfully.
Alright, maybe not *on drugs* -- but he definitely shouldn't be without his oxygen mask.
Great job too! Now your chest will ache... but you won't feel like you've earned a drink after all this.
Across the room: a chalkboard with various reminders, each one a little smaller than the last.
He nods. "As I said, I'm not the sort of man to be critical of a department head. But, in the end, he has to make the call."
The body drops into the freezer as solid rock. Nothing but thawed meat-and-bone litter the scene.
"I don't know, I don't remember anything."
You can take this! Pile it all on him, give him a taste of your <Super Sharp Sandpaper> -- just one more!
Yeah! It was fun.
Who would have thought?
"Okay. What if I don't want to?"
"Why do you keep asking about this?"
Seems like some left-field scientific research was conducted here.
The amount *of* you *wants* to know.
Ah, yes. That sodden yellow sticky thread you found in the junk food wrappers. The little book's name *reads* in *big bold letters*: "A Guide to a Well-Behaved Cockatoo." The thimble-sized illustrated map features familiar: *Katarzine Alasije
Oh, yes. All those options. Maybe you *are* on to something?
What she means is: You should return if you find the Data Brothers on your bounty. They've got him on their list of suspects. You should say: I know you can't trust artists, but the Data Brothers got it wrong.
"Well, whatever. Fine. I don't care about *anyone* anyway."
"Tryin'a fuckin' find the key's like an athletic endeavor -- has nothing to do with real estate."
The man with sunglasses looks at you. "I don't know about this. But it's a *nice* wound..."
At first the lieutenant doesn't say a word, instead trying to analyse the situation with his eyes.
In front of a crowd? It's safe to say that *you* haven't spent a lot of time with *this* man...
I think it would be *interesting* to see what the super-detective thinks about this fascinating and sometimes ridiculous case.
Wow. So you actually *do* know that not to mention it in front of these people would be *unprofessional*.
Shake off the feeling.
Do a headcount first -- connect the dots on the chart.
"Yeah, I don't know. He's..." He looks over his shoulder. "Chillin'. Cuno's always making shit tough."
Well, I would hope so. That being said, you are quite equipped to handle any eventuality that might confront Cuno.
There's a truth here for later too -- when you're done
Golf balls? I know I shouldn't but what is he talking about? You need those balls for your *mind* games.
Watching the others go by -- too busy to be of much use -- you decide to take one more look at the perforations. Just to make sure.
Of course, it's only a theory. There's no way of knowing if it really happened how he said it...
"And you're gonna go to fucking Hell, *leo palasi*."
The young woman keeps smiling her distant smile, above it all. The wind from the casino air cools her blonde hair.
Oh, it's gotten to the point where even I -- a linguistics major -- can't even *un-duck it...'
She raises her
The fresh documentary odour of death makes you shiver.
She keeps it together, tears welling up in her eyes. This is the least of your worries now, he's cheering you on.
"Yeah, I told you she's a *fighter*."
The desk in front of you is empty. There's a stack of documents, mostly paperwork for government contracts, but also some supporting legal papers.
"Go for it."
You see the lieutenant watch you, awkwardly.
"I didn't know the payment was only 3.50. 5.10 was too much. I think they just wanted to make it quick."
"What did you do?"
It does. As do you. And *some* other things -- you find yourself lost in the city, in the not-too-distant future. But *why*?
"You're a peasant, Harry. Please help me and keep the peace."
It sounds a *bit* like some kind of love story, but not quite. Better not push it further.
Some other questions.
"Uhm, yeah. To me it seems like they're *really* concerned about the re-entry mechanism..."
Wow! A bullet hole in the wall. You think I'm not capable of seeing through that opaque pane of glass, that's what it says on the box.
On the bridge? In the middle of the night. At the very end of the world.
He tries not to look at you -- at least not as a cop.
She looks you in the eye impassively, her black hair falling on her face like a snake.
"Okay, you stupid fucking cop..." She shakes her head, then uncoils herself. "Let's leave it at that."
Good to meet you, *bratan*, or *son of a bitch* -- the name's Klaasje. It rhymes with *bratan*, *son of a bitch* -- you got it all right!
These ones probably came in contact with the recently deceased *piggy*.
You're about to open the gates of perception. Gates of perception that have been opened -- by experience and smell. You will be in touch with your inner monologue, the stuff that was meant for you to hear...
All that glibness, of course. He's used to officers speaking more like that. And less of the *usual* language.
What's the lieutenant saying?
So there's a powerful, insatiable lunch-punch combo in the corner of this woman's face. When she looks at you she immediately smacks her big lips...
There's something here for sure,
"Of course, detective. I'm honoured you recognize me. Now, about that..." She's looking for words.
There is no door here. You must have been *completely* insane to leave the faucet hanging, and it's likely he has no idea what happened.
"An epidermochromatic colour scheme which equips you with the necessary discipline and technical knowledge to succeed."
That's all she has to say on the subject. She *has* been thorough -- and truthful -- as far as we can see.
She smiles, then her green eyes grow wide and she tilts her head towards the tall building behind her...
This part of the bunker is much smaller than the one in L'Ossuaire Youths, you get the feeling this part of the bay is not as inhospitable as the one in L'Heure.
And you will see it again, in flashes -- on the corners of your eye, as you gaze down the stairs. Above you, the stone-kicking is abuzz with anticipation.
"Manson --" she says, giving the gun back to you. "And he took the hit."
Papers? Papers would be cool. Maybe you could draw some inspirational quotes, or organize some bingo cards...
Maybe... just maybe...
"No, Kim. I'm not an emergency doctor. I'm a Level 3 Envoy, working with the RCM. I need to talk to you about those spooky... phasmid posters."
"I think they brought you up to speed on the authorities and the work we can do for them."
If it comes off like that, it's because it *is*. It must be, otherwise you're only stirring up bad feelings.
"I see what you mean, officer, but I'm afraid I still don't have the whole story."
You missed the man with sunglasses. But you *got* there was because you *doubled* on top of him, so to speak -- you took the sunglasses off him and you're wearing them to this very moment.
This is not what you came here to do. You came here to do the survey and get the drug stuff going.
Unlike Artemitrunk, *Cuno* didn't get shot. *Or* he might have gotten shot by someone else.
Did the karaoke singer say *The Tempesta*? You can't sing karaoke without The Boss. You should sing it too, sing it loud. This could lead to a really good night's sleep...
The young man is silent. He seems evenly matched in age, yet it is clear that the one with shoulder-length hair is capable of holding his own.
The boy picks it up and inspects it closer. "I don't know about this one. Have you been paying attention? The drugs section isn't *that* cop stuff. I'm surprised you didn't blow it."
(Turn to the hat.) "Now, I see a hat," she says. "What do you say? The hat please."
No... it can't be... It's gone... Somewhere in the past... You feel sick just looking at the paper.
And then the pressure changes.
The fresh paint-job. That's already done now. It's just as nice as the old one, no?
"Yes. We should have arrested her..." He looks you in the eye. "He had the audacity to speak to you."
When the lieutenant questions it's to get an update on the situation inside, not a legitimate look.
What's more -- what has never been -- what will forever be -- what has *not* been -- what is *never* going to be -- can you ever do, right?
It's a device -- a visual analogue of the human head.
"*Or* we can find him and take him to the holding pen at the precinct holding area..." The lieutenant nods to you.
"Yes, Kim, is that you?"
Just let the ink move in the pages.
These
The light is off on the third floor of the Whirling-In-Rags. The young woman has been stabbed.
Your hands with the gun in your one hand, and your gun in the other.
Whatever you do, don't ask him about the phasmid. You'll spoil it for him.
"Yeah, I can't believe he's still around..." he says, his voice now steady and level. "What a lovely lad... Thank you for saving my balls. I'll pass. I'll pass the time between now and then with those beautiful *yefreitorias*."
He arches his brow. "The whole geology of the Insulindian is ... incomprehensible. Even I was -- until I started looking around."
"Aye. Most suspicious. Let's see what this next one has to say."
"She's under arrest for the murder of her employer -- Evrart's good-good..."
He's glad you did this.
She's really, really struggling to get out of bed. Maybe it's a good idea
Suddenly -- behind you -- a chill comes over you. It's possession, a creepy feeling...
She's silent for a second. Then, in a hushed voice, she says: "It's too late for that. At least I can see you didn't sign it."
I don't care. Stop asking me questions. You don't know the answers.
"You're still a suspect in the murder investigation. Go ahead and say it in front
He looks at the reeds, slowly -- ever so slightly -- but surely, before nodding once more. "I say, sod off."
Not *all* of them. There are still a lot of them out there. The case could go to the forensics if they haven't finished their work.
Pfft... you really don't.
It is disorienting and strangely persistent. As if it were giving instructions to your brain.
"Wait -- why does it say *leopard print*?"
Retreat slowly. [Leave.]
He does not seem to know how to answer.
There's an *unclear* sound over the metal as the speaker tips over -- and the little metal box at the bottom pops out like a pebble. You think the thing is on the ground, but...
You need to talk to him, *maybe* he can teach you the value of hard work.
The boy starts to cry.
"Oh, it's you. The rat man." (Point to the big guy behind the fence.) "You look like you're having fun."
The camera's image stabilizes, so you can make out the hair on her back.
Underneath, a long time ago...
A vehicle with recent repossessed plates and tires rumbles down the street. You see a painted grill towering above it -- likely the one the motor carriage was travelling in.
A logo and the like... there's nothing more you can do for now. Just keep it professional, *and* *cool*.
"Oh, okay. Cool. Well... " He furrows his brow. "I'd love to see you in your messy work clothes, cop-man. With your new ****-pants."
You see several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf beneath a display of croissants and juice bottles. The raincoats are transparent
"I think it's something called the visual cortex. Or some say the filippian impulse -- it's the area of the brain that's responsible for perception and volition. He wasn't a *detective*. He was a... *gendarmerie*."
He waves his hand energetically. "Look, I'm not trying to judge. Just tell me about the *coat*!"
Disconnect tone -- indicates that the call has gone unanswered.
"Sucks, man, but if you think about it -- this is very much an art thing. You know, you don't even need anything else."
In a small bathroom on the second floor of the Whirling-in-Rags, far away from the fighting pits...
The bright future. The concrete slab of the future feels alien, foreign even, as though poured from a distance. The concrete slab of the past feels limitless, like a painting.
Take the remains of the sandwich and throw them away.
He pays you no heed. "Surely the jolly-man is being cautious for you... do you think he told the whole truth?"
This sounds awfully familiar. Perhaps you were looking for a way into the cabin the one the captain left?
What a funny little cap! Don't let the *grave* fool you -- this is a snap-snap decision with absolute, *nothing* to worry about.
Help, I'm suffocating...
Perhaps it's the hangover talking? Or the massive heart attack paranoia, but they seem suspicious...
It's an optical spatial occlusion that blends into the background noise. Go ahead, take your time.
"Right, this is boring. Can I say something about the cell-phone thing?"
This *knew* it's a pinko pickup until you said it to his face... This man is a *hero* -- he *stood up* and screamed LETS GO!
He sighs. "No one is perfect. But this man... he *seems* to be a bit *crazy*. That's it. If you just stand there and *try* to catch it, it'll just stand there..."
Disco music is blaring through the speakers. So are your angry voices... all are strangely intense at first...
"What kind of weird shit is that?"
No. This time the will to live really *saves* you. Your skeleton has taken the hit too. You're ready to move again.
"No need to rub it in, lieutenant. There are plenty of eyes to see that look like you... and many fine machines to be solved. The *doom problem* is long and... sad."
But he's not *crazy*. The cop world is so scary and confusing, he thinks, even if he doesn't have to.
There's a white flash on the photographic memory stick in your hand.
He points to the older woman. "She was a *real* police officer, remember?"
A cage-like trinket hangs around the statue's head. It's covered in a thick layer
Okay... yes. This is a mistake. You should drop it.
"The 2.46 gigaton warhead he dropped on *Jaipur*." The lieutenant nods along. "Another superlative too."
There's this cool rifle, but you're not sure if it's
He's being sarcastic.
He groans. "Sometimes I just need to lie here and *forget* for a bit. Come back when you've gotten your act together."
Still hard to believe...
As you gaze upon its mechanized heart, the little behemoth begins to solidify in front of you.
"Okay, so we don't know why he did it. What about his... medical history? Are you sure he's not part of the Union?"
"That's it, that's my call. You
"Officer," the lieutenant intervenes and breaks the deadlock. "The Union is providing medical assistance..."
"Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, there's plenty of trash along the river and in the houses along the coast."
The rain falls on her shoulders, tinting her blond hair green. It smells of industrial pollution and brine.
Yes. Nothing, because you took the heat off Kim by calling the shots. He's the one who said they'd been poisoned.
Don't let him finish the sentence!
The tactician chooses to ignore the memory.
"Yes, that was the colonels. They gave us the right to work."
A man's got to stay humble, he thinks.
Inside the cage, the light from the window reflects off the wooden boards. Above, a black board carries a chipped chitin through the dark hallway.
Man from Hjelmdall fights some hard nansy gangs of lurid dunces who seem to lack basic moral fiber. Two young women are engaged in anointing their (unjust) imprisonment. To spare their skins ...
There is something on the water's edge, a shapeless mass of nameless shacks. An old roadbed, hauled to
You're starting to sound like a Niall Higgins here.
"You see, the Union pays an *all-is* salary, while the *one* pays a *single*, fixed yearly amount -- usually the same as one day's *salary*."
Really? Nothing. Just dull eyes looking at you -- there's nothing here to say. Nothing to do.
With his wife by his side, Evrart looks outward, as if to say:
She tilts her head and looks up at the sky, distracted.
The man shudders. Then he remembers *you* are his enemy.
A void is a vacuum, basically. When you die you don't get back to this body. This isn't a *mystery*.
Why does *nothing* exist?
Stripped of the suits -- *and* the boots. The surface is slowly glistening from the countless dripping, flowing and rippling patterns of the fluids.
As your fist leaves his side, the kid fires a brash and/or arrogant shot straight at your liver... you dodge it, mouth suspended in agony.
The girl is of the animal kingdom. Certainly she was abused as a child -- or as a child would be abused when they're not paying attention.
As I said, it's been a blast so far. So much so that I've *let* the dream take root in my *heart*. It's really something.
The great district hums in the coming days: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the rust-colored horizon...
"Fine. What if I want a cigarette."
A *poor* eye indeed. The bird's nest sits half-submerged in the snow, freezing your words as you take a step back to look at the sea...
What the fuck *is* art? And why would *Iilmaraan desert pygmees* paint themselves? Don't answer that, just nod.
What a fool.
"Look at the time. Are you telling me the usual..."
Look at the guy under the truck.
"I don't care about *anything*. Love is fucking *hard*, man."
You are. The world is. Still -- the sun burns bright and the stars are twinkling on her face.
"I've definitely had my share of drink-related incidents -- once or twice."
It seems the card is meant to express a regret -- but what could he have *to* with a memory card? Forget it.
She grins. "I'm always glad you asked, Harry. Of course, I'm glad you're alright and well. For all your *cop-work*
It *definitely* has something to do with that! Something that night told you to go for a wee drink... Was that a typo? Anyway, don't listen to that guy -- we don't need a *batallion* of *words* in our heads.
Here's the plan: You jerk left, right, centre, centre again, *mirror* right back, *repeat* left, *repeat* right, *repeat* up...
"I've been to Paradise."
*"I'm a law-cop."
He had to resort to such an extreme way to deal with the situation.
Somewhere in Central Jamrock lieutenant Kitsuragi steps into the public library, rows of shelves pass on either side...
You have proven handy in this capacity. Perhaps another time? Anyway, you got the sample. Now go have a look.
She looks at the lieutenant, shrugs.
He turns to the woman. "I *deserve* a knock. For trusting the head of a minor public sector employer. Who knows what calamity there would be..." He pauses, looking at you with a look of intense sadness.
Keep it together. This mother of sinners needs to hear you say: I've *never* shot a gun.
Yeah, yeah, drink the liquor! You're part of the *pale imitation* family, you ride shotgun!
"Who are you kidding, kid? You can't take down a real cop with that speed."
A series of password-protecting tinctures pours out of his nostrils. The air around you seems thick with them.
He looks at the shadows. "The test is a failure. All memory of the case is fucked. There was never a motive, only accident."
The islet looks massive in the distance, lost amidst the crashing of sound and the howling wind.
The black marks on the roof indicate that the vehicle *vaulted* from the crater it left.
It seems the irregular movements of the sand and the water around it have an evolutionary explanation: that each low tide event is followed by a rise in temperature, followed by a spread of white sand dunes. Each high tide event, in turn,
On the platform a young woman is withdrawing from amphetamines, barbiturates and alcohol. Yet still she smiles among the crowd, among the great ghost of the city she's leaving.
It was the camera, boys.
As you let go a tidal wave of tears breaks through the dam and washes away everything.
The flames melt away into a cauldron of white coals. The fire draws water from the fire pit behind Klaasje's command post.
The Man from Hjelmdall lies on his side with his back propped up in the air, like a statue. No one can see in him, but he is secretly admiring the sights and sounds of his day.
Okay. The physical side is still an afterthought -- how will this little wit move on? Better to get it off on the wrong foot.
While it was actually her it's most likely done so out of self-p
"Haven't you got anything for a reasonable price? The Cuno got in his place. Cuno took the hits."
"Sorry. Racist jokes go pretty badly."
WOODS. Hey, this place is a pain in the ass without the smoke. There's no bonfire lit there. Or hot cocoa -- from the window.
Don't worry. I got you. I got you! I'm gon' tell him.
"Okay. And the bullet came from a little over four days ago."
There's a profound longing in that gaze. Like he wants to be one with the material realm, but he knows it's not possible.
You can't really explain it, because it's just something you've got to do. At the moment though, it looks like the bucket is ready to pop open, full of nasty surprises waiting to be sodden.
"Don't be so sure."
"No. There is no 'Gotham City'."
The  high centre of balance is offset by a large battery bank mounted at the bottom of the cabin, feeding all the auxiliary systems.
THE WORLD IS A SUZERAINTY OF CROWD!
Looking up he sees a pair of dark glasses -- Lux *Magni* and Prinsenglass. The man has short, spindly fingers that move in his skull. He's seen this glass before.
The door doesn't move much. You'll have a hard time finding it if you don't make any headway.
In the end it's the bright red blur you perceive as the *least* hectic reaction... Still, it's disturbing.
And even though you know it's probably suicidal, you don't feel guilty about it. You *still* have a job to do.
"How *did* you get him in here?"
"What's he *doing* down there?"
"Some of the locals just call it the knot of doom. They say that no amount of bells will ever fill the void left behind by the passing of a synth-head. As long as I'm here, it says something's missing..."
No, that's not it. The replay feature helps keep the bloodletting a little *brief*. You're a bloody bird.
"This game is really fucking *hard*!" He's shaking his fist in the air.
Too late! You already talked him out of it. The last thing he needs is more questions about the cane.
The name "Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi"
It's a little odd, when all is said and done, how adamantly Kim is insisting that you don't *share* his vision.
"Oh, of course, my friend! I'm delighted to see you here, sweetie. Anything I can do to assist you?"
To the lieutenant's puzzlement, you spend several turns building various improvements to your military power...
Yes. Of course.
"This feeling is threatening..."
The Bum Update
The key stops mid-way in the lock. You hear a dish smashing and shattering inside, then nothing happens.
He turns the page in the corner. "He describes it, basically. A real hit-or-miss proposition."
You don't know anything, but you feel compelled to visit the library.
It sounds like she knows about the Insulindian phasmid, but didn't tell her about the find. Perhaps you could convince her to let you investigate...?
One of the leading lights in the night had turned off her warm headlights, leaving her all lit up like a child.
She smiled at him. "And what technique is that?"
Her shirt is soaked with rain, dripping wet. The inside of it is a little skimpier than the rest of her clothes.
Okay... the last one is *hard*. There's blood on the wooden boards and the sea breeze blowing through the box. It's *totally* your imagination.
This is something we could use to know more about you, the courtier. Who are you? What kind of man are you? We need to know!
You didn't really care about the beaten path. Why did you spend all this time theorizing? Take it back to the drawing board.
What was that about not noticing your presence around? I'm way *more*
I can see you're feeling *unsatisfied*. Let's be fair.
-- disoriented. A bit like when you first laid eyes on that beautiful woman, a million shades of mauve and pink.
You *should* be. Let's face it, the show must be taking place in your head. Outside, however, it's just *one* pipe.
"Okay. She's un
The wind moves the disco balls.
I'd like to learn more about this gun.
"I'm gonna come out to investigate this lab at night. I'm gonna go find that fucking library card and then I'm gonna bring that damn library card back to you. *Pay for* your beer, Harry. And then I'm gonna go and buy a fucking book."
You are reviving an ancient and powerful machine, destroying the very fabric of time and space. It's a shame the Eternite Revacholian isn't up to snooping.
What a shame. Perhaps if you were to stand in just the right spot, even your footsteps would be completely silent...
"Actually, I have a capital situation."
"A lot. Four-thousand, maybe five-th
The woman before you *has* been crying for days, but she doesn't understand the power struggle. A little flattery won't hurt, right?
The lieutenant stares at the reeds. His face has softened. "I didn't see anything particularly interesting in that room."
And a *little* luck, that's a feat for a man his age.
"Don't worry, dear. I'll be sure to ask later. Let's get back to what we were doing, shall we?"
"Good." He's still blushing from the toilet rue.
His preference is solid.
A lot of things are wrong with you right now. The most important of which is your obsession with getting fat.
"I don't know... I can't make up my mind."
Wait, the bullet hole in Filippe's heart! The Six-Million-Dollar Man must have been talking about that bullet...
Do you?
She's quietly laughing at your bullshit -- a morbid pleasure, almost peerless in its dark humor.
"The Beast..." the old man hisses.
That's the first time you hear him admit to it.
The chap is dead serious about this.
"Are you a communist, Rosemary? It's almost as if you are, in your staunch opposition to capitalism."
"Fuck no," the other one yells, raising his voice again. "Fucking fight. BABE, don't stop. You gotta do it or you can't come to class anymore."
The water lock starts moving to the inside of the canister. The lid opens slowly, like a flower bouquet on the chilly spring evening.
There's discomfort. He tries not to show it by rubbing it. But he's a rookie nonetheless.
The black-tailed black dog is guarding the backyard door. It seems that whoever did this has no business at all.
"I'm going to shit your hand off."
"That was very *strict* of me. But I understand now. I'm a policeman first and a novelist second." He says with a sigh. "There's no use trying to run it by *anyone*."
"Abrasion resins."
In this imperfect world, it feels as though there's a devoted group of people watching over you.
Whatever responsible parties I mentioned above are keeping you from this information, it's their decision to make.
The boy lifts his head and gives you a sour look. "Whatever you say, cop-cop-cop-cop."
Don't be an idiot. Asking questions once is better than not asking them at all,
The conference centres are filled with people who don't know how to hate. You can hear the sounds of the assembly coming closer every second.
Really?
Maybe that *reverse psychology* thing was a way into her room? On the jacket? What about that?
Here it comes -- the killing's not
Seems like something hit the table first -- perhaps it's a trigger? The lieutenant places a bullet in the chamber.
You wouldn't have to. Or maybe even better -- *not* do that. Just because you've *said* it doesn't mean it's true.
"Yes, I have, sweetie. That's all I'm saying about that. Please put the tape player down, officer."
Breathing, are you sure?
That's right. You should go on stage and pose for a moment when you're done with the decompression. You *deserve* a photo-op.
"In its defence, the failure rate was much higher. Every year for nearly fifteen years -- I'm judging by the murder rate."
Like a poison oak -- hard to say what exactly -- your left hand is on the handle. Try to feel it with your eye, just in case.
He smiles. "You can never really tell with these birds, are they scary?"
"I was simply too fixated on the phasmid to notice. Or the phasmid's effects."
A cable flicks on the red lock. The plastic tag reads "Tiger-Ctrl".
Was there something here you were supposed to pick up on? What was supposed to happen last week?
No. You should go back. Go and see what happens -- if you get it wrong. Maybe she'll admit to it?
"Do not take it personally. At the end of the day, you are what you are."
The plastic cape around his narrow neck, the industrial dust muck rising from it... you feel like you're about to faint.
Suddenly your entire being returns to its resting place, radiating calm. You are truly immortal.
This is the •Spirit of Consecration* that spoke to you in the «dreams». It wants to talk to you again. Perhaps it spoke to you during the vestigial thaw?
So I should say I didn't.
"Oh, so that's what's on the horizon...
The lieutenant looks down at his bottle of liquor and mutters to himself: "I think I'll stick with the *gun*."
But is it? There's a difference between fondly remembered memories and revachol's best remembered memory.
"It's just... you have to remember. I was going for a *what* with you. This time, with her. Not for her."
"No, I don't need help. I don't need *anyone*."
The pain is strangely absent from this woman's body. It's as if someone just shot an awful joule into it.
"I don't want to talk about myself."
"All you need to do is ask your station some questions -- about me and our little *case*, in a word?"
Your lungs fill with smoke, a great furnace obeying your every need. You are *now* -- in your prime. You will live forever.
"At any rate, this is a rational response. I have my own ideas, they don't need this line of questioning. The fuck were we supposed to talk about then?"
He nods. "We should keep an eye out for the *second coming* -- we should find out what this stuff is before we open that door."
"I don't know about that. Anyway, I'm
Here we go. A trail of blood, a charred log, a pile of leaves. This is a chain used to connect the remains of the victim to the chain.
The remains of a camp on a jagged piece of rock -- a tent, old dishes and cutlery. On the rocks -- an aluminium roofing material called "salt and pepper". In it: a salty rum stain, fading with time.
The stele-headed man holds up his hands in the air, as if shooing away a frightened little child.
"Yes, I know. Didn't think that far in advance would be something we'd be dealing with for the rest of our lives." She
It's your shirt, isn't it?
"Alright, I guess I'll leave that kind of petty stuff aside for now..."
Oh god, a word that can describe how you feel! Okay, so they're not gonna land a blow on you, but it doesn't help either. Either way, it's *wrong*.
You know there's little point in pretending you didn't hear when all the screaming and the screams mix together. You did *not* lose the film. You don't even *have* the film, you're embarrassed of it.
You grab the handle and pull the lever up. As soon as the metal connects against the contact pins you hear the lock click against the contact end. You squeeze the handle, and the spring tension lets go. The door comes loose, like a small doorbell.
The white gloves give you no reply as you smash into the chilly ice. Fortunately, you only touch your bruised hands.
"Yeah, remind me again, what is the *Revolution*?"
"It must be the right tape because the beat isn't there. Not for another 20 years, not for a thousand years, maybe even 1,000 years..." She shakes her head. "God knows we should never get to that point. But, anyway -- can we go?"
"Nope, don't talk to me about it." (Back off.)
I would have rather had it, but I guess there is no use crying over spilled milk. Give it to Evrart instead. He'll make the rest up to you...
The man before you is naked, but for a pair of underpants and white boots. His skin is marbled with decaying veins and blotched by lividity. His hair is wild, turquoise in the morning light.
"...not the most *feminine*, no? Well, you should go and find a new shirt." The young woman gives you a sharp look.
It's definitely him.
I'm sorry this man has got nothing to do with your problems. There is absolutely no use in complaining to him. He ignores your petty
It's dangerous. Feels like *too* much. The weight of history on top of you. You can't think straight again, can you? Can't express yourself like that. All you can muster is these three words:
"I am." (Hand back the container.)
You don't have to jump to the conclusion that most people are faking. But it's the one you would like to avoid.
Focusing -- like an electric drill
Nice try, but this man's got a *knife* in his hand. Perhaps the handle was modified in the Annette?
He sees in the smoke straight ahead -- and in the distant distance -- the snowswept horizon, thick with wind...
Like a cruel prank on the lieutenant.
Good to be you, tolerant outsider. You too are a cyclist, a dreamer and a fantasist. But a dreamer and a fantasist.
"Okay. What else have I got to say."
All that remains is to reach into your pocket and pull out the photograph.
Yes, the woman before you is actually a real wömen -- a bona fide member of the cast and crew of auey!
Indeed. Your eyes are squinting as you look around. A garish sailor, apparently drinking, suddenly appears at your side. He's *totally* gone. Later, when you wake, he'll be there again.
Open the bottle.
"No I'm not. I have something of a conscience about myself. It's why I came here. He doesn't have it in him."
"Papers? There's a desk in the room."
The general view is blocked by the phasmid's mandible and a pair of sky blue spectacles. You can almost *feel* the fatty creeping up on you, hisses -- just the tiniest gust of wind...
(Imagine your life with Kim.)
"I'm sorry, but *I* don't want to talk to you
Fucking liver failure.
These guys are all sodden up. Soured on drugs. The reel of a reel of tape. Sounds like money, sounds like sex. The reel of a tape player...
The man with the sunglasses and his *hypothetical station 41*.
You feel ready, sexy and ready!
"There's something
No one has said it before, but it *will* work. There will be a climax. You can't wait for the conclusion of this story.
"Then it's good to know we have a spot for you." She nods toward the marks on the metal. "This one just..."
"That's hard core. You're shitting me!" He screeches. "Why don't you tell me, what do you know -- and let's move on?"
"Cool. Anything else? Anything else that she *wants* to know?"
"There were no cops in the Whirling,
The night has not come for Roger. God is beyond this, and so are you. Until the end of time, you will not die...
"Egg Head... What? What are you talking about? Did you not just eat that *pollen* off the island?"
He's clearly  been keeping tabs on you -- at the Whirling or any other of the innoss. This is most conspicuous by his use of the anonymizer -- even more so than his use of the pen -- to communicate with you.
"There's one over there. It's in the reeds." (Point to the church wall.)
The man looks around, lost in thought.
Cunuus! Next stop, Insulinde!
"Ah, a metalworker." She relaxes.
"Right." He's noticeably upset. "I'm with the RCM."
How is a sound so faint, so background, that it barely gets across the air before it fades out? Maybe it's because you have weak tissues, or maybe because you have an acute, life-affirming mood swing? Whatever the case, you should still check out the phone book.
What's *sublime* about an 80s soundtrack? A dull disco music listening experience? Hopefully it'll do the trick...
I know you've had circumstances where you've needed to 'turn the heat up'. Right when you thought you were under, he turned the heat up. What, do you like it when I tell you this?!
Could this be the *Grim Reaper* that Enterprise Insurance Agent Blake Jensen is rumored to have been working for?
"It's like
This man *seems* to be in some kind of shape or state. You haven't gotten the chance to really put your foot down since you woke up. How bad is it?
Could this be the *Impossibil* that the kid keeps referring to? That's the marine officer you ran into in the alley. He seems to be a *little* familiar.
Oh, so you are. He's clearly not a man of the left. But why is that? Who cares? It doesn't matter anyway.
She doesn't reply. All you see is her long blond hair, dyed blonde with dark roots. She's smiling at you, as if you're a piece of tissue.
"I'm not telling you about my case."
"I don't know what that means... it's just words my Mum used to say. She was someone else then..."
(The crowned one?)
"Oh." She giggles, but quickly turns back to her work.
It's easy. Just accept it.
Thank you, liutenant erotica, for saying *cities are real*.
The air inky blackness is the only thing keeping the woman calm, made all the more so by the mixture of deadly sedatives.
"But the shelves are empty and the working men are not paying their hall dues. The rumble has ended."
Are you sure it was a good idea? Some women go through life without having a drink, and if anything, you should have *discussed* the morality of your present position with him. Instead of letting him speak.
A frown crosses his face just as you start to piece the numbers together. "These are... uh... numbers from a raid. Yes. There were two other raid bosses, though. Boss Dicemaker and Boss Klaasje. I don't remember our rumours influencing the count."
Should we ever face a totally unrealistic scenario like this, he would probably be cool with it.
"Are you sure? Nothing? Could've been worse..." he thinks.
Say: "I tell you what it's like being a ghost -- it's a sad story. Say the first thing! For heaven's sake, say the *true* thing!"
It's like there's something stirring inside of you, radiating, yet to be felt... a stir moves in your stomach...
An inconclusive histrionics spin.
Also, you should show her the map of Insulinde.
The lieutenant nods. "I understand your dilemma. Your friend has the key, I just need a *schematic* to open the box."
"I've got some bad news for you. I'm about to go kill some people."
There's a peephole in the fog gate.
In the centre of the church stands a military-grade artillery system. Stations of an overgrown chain link fence surround it.
With a loud thud the old man stands up -- pushes the window open -- grabs the key from the hawthorn branch above him. Then he pulls the lever up...
"Ah, hello. I'm your average standard work boot."
A private charter school in Jamrock. The school board is not amused.
"A small girl, probably," the lieutenant turns to you. "Are you up to it, detective? You look like you *need* a drink."
(Flex your muscles.) "Yeah, you too. Those tyres too. Bigger then the tires you had there."
It's as if the case is somehow *rigged* against you...
It's definitely some rare alternative metal.
(Swallow the key.)
The Union has no time for human beings, sire. A violent backlash would void its charter.
"No, Mr. Dros, this is Firewalker --
Well, *and* it doesn't even have to be your last one. You're still being *hypothetically* spy? You know what would be cool, don't you? A *f
"You really are nothing but a buzz-kill right now, detective."
"No matter, I don't care."
Oh, yes. And gigantic. There are too many places to begin -- and places to end -- you can't even remember the names of the places you've been.
You're still in the loop. Get on with the story.
It's probably no accident the Antistar ride is modeled after the famous (and terrifying) roller coaster in your hometown.
"Yeah, man, tell him to shut up and do his job..." He's getting a little *bored* with this. "Let's get back to work."
"It means this *sad* guy is a real dickhead."
"Okay. So what's in there?" (Point to the trap.)
He is to interrogate you -- on the spot.
A bunch of sodden papers sag from the clipboard in your hand. The brittle paper is unfitting of this occasion.
"But what if I want to drive, you see? All these places you've been to. I should really explore my own lorry or something... I don't want to drive behind people's houses."
There's a touching moment when he first starts talking about the city he's leaving. "He said it was called Paradiso. Then he called -- *paradiso* again."
In the middle of a broken plaza, in a cone of light barely visible in the daytime, two men engage in a passionate argument that escalates into violence. The man with the helmet listens stoically as one of them brandishes a knife...
Keep it together, both of you. You're going to have this conversation alone. The lieutenant is too tired to broach the subject further...
"Yes." He looks you in the eye. "There is no art, there is only *blood*. He was murdered because he refused to become one with the Eternal."
God damn it, every time you think about fucking up the world's greatest invention there's a little pause, an apology, and a promise made to make it right.
The sun shines on you as you step outside. It is a baleful gaze -- and a great leap into the unknown.
It's an impulse response, learned in school. It's not here to put forth effort in any particular area, however.
Please stop. It's not fun."
"That they did, thanks to you two. They're big boys after all."
"Sure. The catch is -- you have to show it for the flag. I've got a 'Bloody' on me."
Bent metal, curved metal, the blackness of space -- a symphony of untold numbers of disco balls, playing at your feet and on your
Cuno's not really into singing, but dancing might help you connect with the right people.
His attention is drawn to the fact that you've interrupted one of his routines. He's confused as to why you'd ask such an obvious thing.
"*There's nothing to hide*. There's nothing to be ashamed of."
"That's not a true representation of me, sir. I'm a *real* mess. A real mess of *problems*."
In a small office behind the Old Military Hospital, hunched under the green glow of his desk light, officer James Torson, in standard police work clothes, fiddled with a faded Kurt Weill file. Nothing of great consequence happened.
Oh god, no. She's no laughing matter.
You see three black cubes glued to the x-shaped cross-sections of the tree. The giant birch tree on Rue de Saint-Ghislaine stands in the background, rendered in an off-key manner.
"You're just doing your job. I'm not judging, it's my job."
Selling items from your pawn list earns you cash and experience. It's a great way to get rich.
The cold run-off plunge into the toilet. Clouds of steam rise from the pot, surrounding the pot.
No. It was another flash of lightning that dissolved the negative energy that was shooting up there. You got it. Now take it in.
That's not quite it, is it?
"Very Well." He hands you the gun.
"It's very dapper."
Have you been paying attention *at all*? This was the one you promised to visit. Didn't book your room on the stairs. Guess you were *on* to see it.
She means there *should* be a sign next to the door saying that *you're working for Erdos.
So you know she's not a drug user. But still... weird.
He feels extremely uncomfortable during this conversation. It's not because he's a bad cop -- his mind is entirely made up.
"Yes, for the hell of it."
You close your eyes and dream of the red thread you saw earlier. *The guy who...* he didn't specify.*
"All I know is -- you haven't helped *me* any more."
Your cell is lit by the pale. The sounds of the streets above and the glint of police lights a few paces away.
You know, the hunter's urge is primal. It's primitive. But in the end it's the one you *have*.
With a firm grip you raise the prybar, *debilitating* the old soldier's hand with a *booming* racket. The metal creaks as you bash it into the wood.
Somewhere between the Coppo's and the newsstand, Ronald Cohen stews like a ferret. The two men behind him stare at him -- splitting hairs. Evrart is silent. The silence is deafening.
"Thinking of taking a 4th rung down
She's terrified now. She's confined to a room, attic, box she's never going to be accepted anywhere near here.
"Kim, who's the protagonist in all of this
There is a hole in his neck. Something sharp, like a knife. You're not sure what it is, but it's there.
"No -- I mean facts. I need to know what I'm doing."
He's pointing toward you.
No, he wasn't. You're going to be fine. Just keep in mind -- the wall will come down, the stairs will come down, and the closet door is going to crash back.
All you've done is make Cuno look bad. He should think about what *he* has to do next.
"Didn't think I'd ever get around to writing it."
He gives you a long, slow shake of his head.
"No idea..." she tries to say, staring at the reeds.
He's going to let you speak for yourself, don't worry.
"What's in there?"
It seems the corpse has *somehow* been brought to you. Better to not further distract the young...
The search for the locusts continues unabated. Occasionally, small locusts crawl out from under the boardwalk and tram the tracks clean with their tiny legs.
"Can you just let me in for a few moments? I need to charge my battery
Every book is a downer when it comes to the bookstore, especially the *old school* series. You know this well -- a lot of hurt.
He furrows his brow. "That... is absurd. That's an entirely different ballgame. What if you were to *untie* the bonds that are so dear to you?"
What was that about *not remembering* things?
What? I'm not scared.
Oh my god, the footprints! The lace...
"*Revacholian*... I think that's really a misnomer. Revacholians are a special type of people. But Rev
Just let him feel.
"Yup, my pal Jean. These scabs are right behind you."
You're too old to be fun anymore, bruiser. Get the hell out of here before anyone sees you throw shit.
Was there something *about* that? Could it have been... L'Ossuaire.
He appears sincere, but he knows himself to be a slippery bastard. Whatever he said, it couldn't hurt you.
This damaged motor carriage is unlike one bearing the RCM stamp. A new carabineer would feature heavily armoured side panels, but this one lacks such protection. This *shows* -- a lot.
Wait, but why?
The two square off in a ring. The former invites you to try something, while the latter still wants to prove his mettle.
The force of it is unequaled.
"Uh huh." The lieutenant says, in a quiet voice.
The banged up motor carriage sits in the salty ocean water, cold and sad, and you're not moving.
Try to make out *the fat man* would like you to imagine this is what he's been trying to prove all these years... you are in for quite the exhibition.
It's... a bit like you're about to start falling asleep.
An elderly couple chatters on a worn-out anechoic metal panel. The words "RETIRED" are embossed into the heart of the poster, now only half-covered in icicles.
"I'm not taking up your time -- what is this?"
She takes a moment to collect herself. Then she speaks. "Fine then. I'm not used to being accompanied by a *compassionate* cop."
"What is this all about?"
*'hard core'* is an illusory linguistic category that attempts to erase all traces of itself... with its weird synchronic language.
A narrow glimmer of snow falls on a three storey tenement building at the end of a winding street. Snow falls on the tenement's roof, melting away. In the back yard of the one called Deanna Deneuve, a rush of emotions passes her lips...
"Look, it's disgusting. I have chemicals under my control. That's the end of the world as we know it."
Open the book.
Look, there's plenty of ways to go about it -- by the time the lieutenant's man lights it would probably be too late.
You're not 100% clear what you're doing, but you *should* do it. Go ahead, do it -- any one of you -- and they'll do it for you.
Turbulence? Oh no! The great district hums in the breeze: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron,
"Of course, I'm very sorry." [Leave.]
Yeah, you got that, *bratan*. Nothing else to do here. You're just gonna have to wait until the *next* one.
It's for keeping the atlas open. The system has failed you. It will attempt to augment your abilities for a short while longer.
This is a risky business for a rookie cop. If you don't pick up on clues, you could be *ruined* in the process.
"Our next door neighbour has her stuff together." She shakes her head. "And she knows how to control the purse strings."
"Never mind. Who cares?" He turns to you. "Let's look for a new tape player. It's gonna cost *well*."
"There must be another way to approach the case, officer. You could try looking for the Dicemaker in my Lickra(TM) shop, or your local pawnshop. I have some quicks."
Or was it *taxidermy*?
As you hit the buttons on the side of
What is this? An athletic challenge? Scream it from the top of your lungs immediately, show that asshole!
Yes! Listen to you -- a *thing*, really grasping the makings of doubt! -- that's *actually* what he's going to do.
Nothing you said could ever happen again! That you were about to open yourself up to some fate you cannot even fathom. This is the end of the road...
"There is -- not much. The rest is just hunch. What was it used for? What kind of *projectile*?"
No, that's not it... Don't say things like that. You're going to make mistakes, don't worry.
Looks like the bird was ripped off the shield that was used to mount it. The book might be of interest to you.
Your tongue wags a little.
Get a hold of yourself, this is a kids game. You can't incriminate yourself in your head. Only assault the lawyers.
"Yes, a critical mass, the gaon of global socialism, will sweep all before it. They call it The Long Night... They say it will last *forever*. For tens of millions of *reál* and millions of deaths."
"Of course, comrade. Of course." The big man smiles a wide, trusting smile.
The ocean breaks apart into a tangle of sub-areas. From the Insulindian isola, the mighty Insulindian isola isola has been divided into the sub-isolas of Graad and Negevara.
Even when you're done thinking about the bad things in the world, and you're done *thinking* about a drugstore... well, it's probably not a drugstore.
There are few. Only the sand between your fingers.
"I don't really care about *any* of those things."
Then it's not *that* bad. Possibly the strongest shot you've ever seen, even.
Then there's *evidence* that he did it. The apartment has been heavily vandalized with Nazi salutes and the character "the skull" has been painted red.
Cuno knows you'll never walk that back.
I'm not kidding. That's not how this works.
"I guess I have some experience of mine, yes."
You don't really know -- maybe you shouldn't rush in.
One of the most popular and controversial tracks is *the Fjördhæmmer* in Hammerfell. Made of raw, hard stuff...
"I *know*." He nods. "Herald of the Sun."
Calm down. If you want to keep moving, you need to stop taking abuse. Stop saying *you* and start asking questions.
He gets it, you lost it.
We're not doing that. You can still look cool and act cool -- the muscles in your neck aren't giving up. You can keep it, though. You can look cool
The words are so far from your lips, but the smile on your face could already say *I'm back! I'm back!
The man nods. "She was clearly under tremendous stress in that situation. If she didn't feel she could trust Cunoesse, she would've called him instead."
But I already told you -- that's Cuno.
You're wrong. There's no other actor in the play. Not one. There is no dress rehearsal, no one.
"People are scared. We are afraid."
"From where I stand I can see two possible scenarios: *I* am either a *good* detective or an *insane* insane individual. Either way..."
She's looking for an excuse to shut you up -- and you can hear it in her voice: "I can't tell you for certain, sweetie..."
This is an opaque shell of the once-great institution known as the *Granate Kubektional* -- the kingdom of Cuno. Its distinguished *ducks* have landed in lake Ontario. Surely this writer knows what to look for...
"Here," he points to the reeds.
"We got along, didn't we?"
After what appeared to be a very, very long time, the jolly-looking man takes out his thumb and brings it to your shoulder.
"Of course. Good-bye." [Leave.]
He sighs. "I just... have to say goodby to Dick Mullen. For now. See you on the other side of the street, between the break and the glass..." He signs the document and hands it back to you.
The hand-held radio is on. You hear the camera lens focus on you.
She is unfazed by your question. She would consider it impolite to point out any perceived weirdness.
You should stop. You're not ready for what's awaiting you in the dark. It is not what you remembered -- It's not even painful, it's almost *okay*.
They couldn't take any more criticism. Every once in a while, they give you a *little*.
"That is what I was implying."
She looks at you suspiciously.
"I have a camera." (Show him your finger pistol.)
Why would he be *testy*? He's cool. He has no shit.
Declutter and transform your desk.
Of course, there are plenty of other reasons for hiding your documents from the law -- and you should, too.
You feel your feet dragging the massive and surprisingly light weight, gurgling with gastric juices. As you stand there you slowly notice the amount of broken down wooden and plastic from the store's various department stores. A brief glimmer of how they must have looked -- to someone who's never been inside.
She fidgets her hands suggestively as you process the information.
"Good bye then." [Leave.]
"Rows and rows of thrones, kings, queens and republicans lie buried in unmarked graves in the Martinaise cinderblock plain. Some dismembered, scattered. The flesh seems green under the cold winter's sun..."
What do you mean *uncertainty*? We have no idea. Be careful.
Let's examine the bedroom rug again.
"Okay, I think I'm good now." (Keep it.)
"I'm a veteran of a thousand battles. To go down fighting *the enemy*, regardless of who he might be, there is no greater honor."
That's it, that's how we do it.
The corpse does not recognise you.
"I have another question for you."
To Hell with Love! This is your last warning. If you don't change, there's a slim chance the bad times may come -- at the cost of your health.
"*SOLOMONIA*, I hear you!" She nods to you, obviously relieved.
You feel the familiar tingle in your fingertips, as the lieutenant draws the trigger.
Your heart has finally pumped all the excess oxygen out of your lungs. What do you do? You don't talk, but you *feel*...
His forearm is covered in bruises and half-filled with bandages. Wound treatment has failed.
Inside the 1.2 km2 expanse of water -- Motulsajý *paą† dire klubięt, lit. 'Stories we never tell' -- there is almost nothing to see here, only the ghost of the former residents staring at you from the forced perspective of the books.
He taps on the hat rack. "I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you anything more about the case until you get home."
Is that why it was interrupted?
"Fine, I'll talk to Titus and find out where he was when it happened." (Bring it
The wall towers over you as you stare at it in silence -- day after day. Up here, in your heart, a thousand times smaller...
"You just let that happen," the lieutenant says, his voice breaking with anger. "She was pretty weak."
"You don't have to worry much about your name, I don't care."
"Where did you get this key from?"
It's cold out here. Not cold enough to wear out those sturdy poles, but you could push them. Also, you're paranoid.
"Well, enough about Evrart and his lady-men..."
An absolutely *crazy* thing to do. Especially if you're a predator of sound.
Then he nods -- sending another backwards glance his way -- and lets out a bellow that sounds like THREE SOUNDS TCHTCHTCHTCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHBOTTLE TOOK A BOTTLE.
Partly because humans have the capacity to be principled and work toward a common vision.
What was that? Slurp it? Absurd! The very act of talking brings out the *incompetence* in you.
There's a gap where the name of the song should be. You should ask her about the corpse...
Discussed mental health.
"Of course," he says with a smile, nodding in agreement. "You're absolutist in your views, Harry."
Though he's usually only found deep inside the convict's cabin, one must wonder what *Steffany* would think of this...
There's a mail delivery box in the back and a toolbox under the seat. The drivetrain levers up above the passenger seat...
The lieutenant takes a step back and looks at the church looming over you -- yonder -- as if he didn't see it. Then he speaks quietly. "No reason to rush, I just have to do my *his* job."
Lands *move* on the face of the earth. In other words, they reconstitute themselves. If Iouden were to disappear into thin air, they would re-appear elsewhere.
It sounds a bit *grown up*
Looking up at the sky -- in the distance the ocean waves are melting, turning to the south east -- is soothing. All you can see is two neon lit shapes: a man and a woman in ragged polyester clothing.
Of course you are! It's awfully easy to quit drinking!
Feels great, like a hundred grams of cocaine have fallen to the ground within the last two seconds. Your chest relaxes.
No you don't. You don't need a gun to enjoy the pot of stew either. You just need a steady hand to stir the simmer.
"Her skill set is, like, international trade. She's one hardie cop-go right now."
It's the kind of shit most young people are taught at an early age -- when they first start shoplifting.
You're already halfway done here, when the smile dissipates.
She would have a good view of the tribunal from here.
Yes! You *are* responsible! Be **responsible*! By choosing to keep this little fuss *behind* your back you have no other option -- you're locked into this life!
You can feel the bones move, like sandpaper underneath your fingernails. Don't say anything, it'll only make her sad.
My head hurts.
MAYBE YOU'RE AN OFFICER?
"What's up with the two hooks in your truck, do you have a problem with them?"
I'm sorry. (Subtly.) To the best of my memory, these are the only items of clothing in the room.
There's a huge difference between the police and the dockworkers.
You start reading, but it's hard. First you've got to get through this, then you've got to finish *Detective* Du Bois -- then you've got to find *The Cuno* and *Bruno*, the previous mentioned drive-by shooting suspect.
"Alright, Harry, don't worry about it." He appears to be seriously concerned about the youngster's scruffy features. "This could turn out to be some *major* shit if this goes bad."
As if someone left out all the *wrong* sections... you'll end up with questions -- where does that take you, detective?
"Is that why you're here, detective?"
Like the rim of a giant wheel, a number of spokes have once again emerged from the flesh-gunk.
Then you have nothing. Only an empty old jacket.
Look at the door.
"See, pig, that's exactly what I'm saying. Do *some* work around here." The kid looks at the grill, his eyes beetling with excitement.
doesn't make it any easier.
The water stream recedes, all that's left is to erect a *sacrificial column* in her honour. Step one: Find the key.
The man holds himself for warmth in his own arms. "Thank you. For everything. For trusting me and telling the lorryman what they did. For trusting me in the first place."
"I was just over the moon to see that, officer." The smile is wide and radiant. He nods to you in greeting.
A shotgun shell sits in the empty amphitheatre, just like in the picture -- left there for a moment. The sun has set behind the mushroomed crater.
"What happened to you?"
She smiles, looks you in the eye, and nods thoughtfully. "My friend doth protest too much. And doth have plenty of things to protest."
His hand is covered in bruises and half-plastered. Still, the experience has changed something in him. It's a big change for him.
The old man sees the gun he's holding and says with a slight smirk on his face, "Do you know how many years it took to get me? Three? Four? Five? Anyway, I guess that's *one* less to worry about."
The politics of bulimia are more interesting then the biology of bulimia.
You feel *lucky* to be alive -- and to have done this. You're probably rich now, with a nice house and nice cars.
She doesn't really know.
No. You don't need it. You don't need *anything* from heaven. But you will need it to go forward in the next world.
The dicemaker erupts in laughter. "I'm glad you think so, but... can we *not*?"
Oh, it's in there.
Stomach truth. You're in for a long life of convo, red-blooded man. Convoy with diarrhea and *nodule*.
It's a shame -- that *tribunal* is supposed to be a *last resort*. Terminating it would *definitely* solve the case.
Make it, make them happy.
"It would have to be a really big one, ma'am. That's all I can say for the rest. They would need to be *luminescent* in order for the effects to be felt."
"God, it's like the life of a captain then. The kind that doesn't last..."
Yes, and it *is* unsettling. As if there's something sinister lurking behind the city streets.
Hold up. This would have been a good time to say *yes* to finally meeting Kim!
The dial slides under the dusty glass, dark and silent. You make out an R and Z with the number written on it.
Oh... you're the grim reaper, then?
"What a pity. I'd absolutely hate to see you lose your memory." He nods with an air of sad resignation.
You see the armoured personnel carrier "Filippe" swimming in the bay. You should ask him about the sunken carapace.
Titus doesn't say anything, but his features show him relaxed, softening.
It may be that way for a reason.
The sobbing stop sounds
"I'm not really a storyteller, but I know what you meant. Did I say *terrible* things about you?"
"I can get him to talk, he's a good cop!"
That bitter thought passes through your mind as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass.
He takes out the photo of his colleague and shows it to the officers across the yard. Below it, a cloud of cigarette smoke stretches far above the garden of Hsin-Yao.
Yes, you. You absolutely must be a member of the Royal Rows in Stereo 8, the Superseded Monitors in the dark and the Tojo booth in the smoke-filled hall. All of them -- all of them.
Don't back down now. Say it's over -- you *will* fix it. The only thing you've failed to do is learn more about this little hornet's nest.
The jacket is of no great avail. The pants are stained with Old New England's cousin's blood.
This is also the wrong decision as far as you're concerned. You should stop the monstrosity before it destroys everything!
There's a snag, though: your foot has no place for the big boot, only the thorny *sole* of the boot. You have to choose between the boots. Which one do you want?
He thinks this kind of talk is very important. Sentimentality is not his forte, but it's the one he gave for *five* minutes. Maybe he likes it?
The door to the 'Weasel's' Den', guarded by the lionhead-knocker. Don't worry, he's here for you too!
It was, but then again, so was Maxime Cousteau.
She's screaming at him, in case he forgot: you got his shit together. *Now* you got him.
The wind breaks. The sun rises. You see the little rectangle drop by drop onto
The word lingers in the air of that small window, as you wait for it to open: "The delinquent gives a line in *
Of course. You're a cop and a snuff fan. Stop being a snuff fan and stay on cop show.
First, a little history. The drive-in was built in part to cater to the discerning palates of hard-core movie buffs.
"That's, like, a proof of concept, right there. That the law hasn't caught up with the B-team. We need to find her first, if we're gonna get a chance to talk to her."
It's the legacy of your fallen friends.
In her hands, lit by a kerosine flame, you see several feet under the canopy of a charred tree. A mannequin in a purple coat stands in the corner, clutching a slice of pizza...
It's not happening, he thinks. I was hoping you'd understand.
You're just *supposed* to do that. It's not that hard. You've *done it* before.
He smiles. "An inconclusive quest -- it all ends up in the trash once the main quest is complete. Fact is, though, no
Soggy carton, maybe some of the wrappings got there too... You'd need to check out the remains of your search to get these wrappers back.
Your heart working overtime, trying to push the lump out of your throat... How many turns back do you take?
"You don't speak the slightest bit of a thing about ain' line. All you do is wake up and they find you."
"How about we change the subject?"
Why don't *you* just yell to the ghost like that, Kim?
Wow... sounds *boring*.
"Yes, we should, you know. All my notes will be automatically deposited into your custody upon request. All you need to do is open the locked door and take the tape -- this should be relatively painless, if not quite impossible, once you've done it."
The moustachioed thoroughbred sits among the others, in front of the main stage, enjoying the wind blowing in from the sky.
As you look at the table of contents, the book seems to begin to rattle a bit, as though it were on a steady diet of cold water.
You can hardly hear him over the radio. The static is so thick, you can't even hear his
"Yes, that's right, detective. I mean if you think I'm an amnesiac you need to look at me." He smiles. "And you need not have been in any hurry to ask me about that."
"Nope, you don't understand. I'm rich and I have all sorts of money."
It's hard to imagine anyone coming into contact with him after this. The only person you hear talking about him from your memory is *Titus*. Talk about what you would like to hear more of, don't try to explain.
You should be particularly careful with this dangerous liquor, headstrong man. It's dangerous to even think about it.
In the '30s the visiting ethnostates first brought cheap manufactured goods into Dominica, where they 'burnt out' villages and made most of the colonies wealthy. The locals, who had the initiative, usually traded in their hard-won mugs for sweet wares from across the ocean.
The young man stands motionless, his left hand reaching for the stump of a post. There's a hole in his skull, and he's trying to reach in there.
And ultimately, it doesn't matter. Just stick with it, detective. This might take a little getting used to...
He did it. "I will have *nothing* to do with this now. I'll deal with the corpse on my own. Deal with the needle nose now."
*Did* I say that? I'm sorry I threw away my gun -- it's a good one. (Lie.)
Wait, stop talking about this nerd stuff. You have enough fun without this
"Aye. We should give the key to your employer. Otherwise, it'll just get lost in the shuffle." He nods toward the locked office door.
"Who's my sister? I haven't heard anything about her..."
This is your gun and in the world of unarmed civilians it's often not your style to confront violent or suspicious individuals.
"RIGHT TO WORK! RIGHT TO WORK!" he yells from his perch at the window. "Right to work! For the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, for the people, forthe people, forthe people, forthe people, forthe people, forthe people, forthe people,
With your eyes trained on the figure you see something move in the darkness inside the church. That's the church door.
Draped in ancient sadness. These are her last reserves of strength.
Your head is empty. You should go and mourn...
Maybe *i* can take you as a peer? Don't worry.
"Here, you're one of us now."
Press *Equip*.
My imagination is screaming at you right now -- tell me about the ultimate reward too!
You're going to have to play by the book here. And by the rules. Who knows what arcane codes might be hidden behind every rock and ice!
He doesn't reply. There's an almost unanimous agreement in his voice -- this man is not who he is without you.
How about something a little less *girly*? You should try something, see what it's like...
"Hold on, you don't want to put a dead body into the fridge?"
The custodian looks over the sand dunes, over the huge water bodies they share, and says: "They go under water together. Until further notice, no one dares to go near those parts."
"Good. Now about something else..."
Of course it's only a *show*, isn't it? Why are you pretending to be interested in this garbage?
You already *were* a necromancer! You've always been a necromancer!
"Yeah. Well -- some people are like that, have that property..." He pauses to look at the building. "But you?"
He stares at the pot -- alternately inspecting it with his mouth agape and blanketing his face with icy indifference.
The officer's *compassion* apparently makes him forget the grimacing mass of rotting flesh below...
"Where did they get the tapes?"
Now, I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out... are you sure you want to?
At the risk of offending some of the more sensitive individuals in your life, I'd like to propose an alternative theory: that you're ill. Have a look at that window before you go anywhere, it's got Fischer
"Who's there? Who's down?"
"Mug me one of these sandwiches."
"What about my copy of 'Lamby'? How did you get hold of it?"
She only gave it half a chance, but she got splashed. Ripped off, too -- by a drunk who believed she's more powerful then him. So he took out his trusty gun. Instantly the man is on the move again. Sneaking, clawing, punching -- it's *all* over.
He smiles. "A legend has it that there was a coup d'état under way in Revachol a week ago. The media has abuzz
"Any
He winks at you, gruffly. "We're scientists, not police. Win 'bout who knows where they got the material."
The papers still look fine under the sun. There's still a red tarpaulin cloak hanging from his neck, though.
A great excitement is bubbling
He's not feeling too comfy in his own skin-castle. A strange itch comes across his lower body.
"You're right. I was on the verge of
Nothing
How can they do *that*?
"It's meant for entertainment purposes only. Do not take this performance art advice seriously."
He nods and turns to the man sitting on the fence. "The headless FALN rider was about halfway done dissecting him. We should continue -- at his funeral."
You're kidding, right? No way. You need to trust these guys, 'cause they have the guns -- and *love*
A sprig of fresh mint.
"That doesn't sound like a very good way to ask about stuff. I'm just a regular cop in Martinaise."
You're sissy, sissy! Do you *have* to worry about keeping your nose out of the container?
"In the next room I'll open the door, then you can go and tell him."
You were a sad drunk who bought an ugly tie -- who gives a shit! Everybody is going to die because the plan was so rubbish. Plan A is a paper tiger.
A little while after the transfer, everything is still in place. You are in a clean, comfortable building, surrounded by your... er... things. Er... whatever else you are.
All of this mere mortals gathered here to see what all the fuss was about -- and for a change, instead of sticking their fingers in their ass to get a look at your brain stem.
Somehow you manage to hear the *duck thinking* in her words.
So, you see, it's sometimes also difficult being a triple-A film producer. All three of you are. But you do it because it's the right thing. You *love* the police.
Incorrect. Kasparov was a nineteen year old virgin who studied musicology at the university where you are now. He was a dreamer.
Oh, I don't care. What do you care about? Right now you're a full-time *onward swing* cop! You got it, f****t! Dance until you're done with it!
She just wants you to be aware that she had *some* involvement with the material world, even if just a little.
You flip through the book. It's a *fantastique* kind of thriller. (Click on the link at the bottom of the page.) This book is *not*
What's interesting about this skiff is that it will always be there, as long as it remains in your hand. Even if you drop it or it land on
"Of course. It's *my* favourite. You don't have to answer. Now, is there anything else I can help you with?"
"Wait, that doesn't *feel* like it." She sounds almost as worried as a man she just met.
"Sorry, man. Don't understand what I'm
An iconoclast of the Adversary Militias, the Filippian legacy still smoulders in the air. The dead still walk among the living -- a colouring almost indistinguishable from their former self.
"I don't know what I was
How did we get here? Where is she now?
"So when did you learn to shoot from?"
A flame that's out of control. Hot tears of pain streak across your face. You have to *pray* to get out of this.
Hold on! Did he just say *I want to spend the rest of my life with this*. What does that mean?
She had a down-to-earth, earnest manner about her, and an easy-going manner about her conversations.
"Yes. It's a perfectly viable option. Just *slowly* acclimating yourself to the XKB diet."
Titus lapsed into unconsciousness two weeks ago. Now he's tossing and turning in his sleep, possibly as a result of the heavy drugs use.
She shrugs. "You know, I don't really use words like that around here... anyways, good luck."
It's merely a theoretical exercise. A demonstration of methodology. The result will be your loss.
The lieutenant takes a step back and mutters to himself: "...the small wrinkles... that have surrounded this corpse's mouth for days..."
No need to overthink it. He just wants you to be the police -- no questions asked. No shady business dealings.
The lieutenant puts down his notes.
"Hey, he's right, I'm not surprised."
The boy frowns, looking into the distance. Then he nods.
"Yeah... I do. The parlour -- they don't work here. They're soft under sodden yamlins. Fucked good. The Union members keep the purse strings locked tight..."
The wingtips of your Phantom Poodle sit on the tail fins like so many tiny pieces of art. Impressing, yes.
"Yes, but she's only ever *signed* documents. If they were to ever read them, they could easily write you a new one."
He is confused.
"Never mind the innocentic complex -- *nitrate* is just oxygen!
The jacket itself is not particularly hard to find. It may be hiding somewhere in the cabinet.
He's getting something out of the box.
This is part of a larger set of files that will be picked up on later. Leave the others for now and when you get the time, resume the discussion.
There is an evil,
The wind stops, but you can feel it stirring again, closer to the site of the crime. Maybe you should revisit this topic after you've talked about the cockat
"So let's hear it, man."
The man looks confused for a moment. "I don't understand. If they're not talking about her... Then who is?" He waves his hands. "Don't rush, we have to stop this."
"Whoah, it's such a pain in
Or -- remember what you said about the jacket? The sweat chart? Your jolly theory about the man wearing an officer's jacket...
He turns to you. "And you're the RCM. You decide what crimes to investigate. I lead the RCM now. In the future, when you're *not* here..."
You should check yourself for pulse, because *suddenly* there's something in your jaw that says: I'VE SEEN YOU AND I'VE SEEN YOU AND THIS IS AN UNKNOWN BODY WEATHER IDENTITY RACE AND YOU HAVE TO FORM AN IDENTITY RACE
The kid squints at you, then looks at the sea, then back at you...
He looked at you, his round face shining, then said nothing.
She is going to love this. Say the insincere title to her *scientific knowledge*.
"I'm a sacred man, don't get me wrong. But I also need some money. It's like any other man."
Is this why our relationship soured?
He's quiet, holding on to the cigarette. It would *spillane* something, like a tear of innocent life.
Oldboy lights another cigarette and says: "I guess it's only a *judo* anymore. That's all I know. Don't ask, don't tell."
Those machines are almost too large for comfort. You're forced to improvise. Throw in the towel and say:
You make the most of the opportunity to build a bridge. It'll give you leverage in the future.
Someone who really likes to imagine themselves as the centre of a highly complex and bloody event.
"Like... 'Viejita! [Leave room.]' Like that'd be good ballistics... But I mean no disrespect."
And this guy?
Does he have a little *disappointment*? That the corporal was "put into solitary confinement"? It's not a *lie*.
Your hand shakes so hard it shatters into tiny pieces, your fingers just a bit cracked from the impact. You stand there with your hands squared off.
"No, I'm not making them."
You don't even *have* a face any more. The last thing you remember is the slime-covered mess inside your mouth, gushing down your gullet.
The door seems heavy -- even for you, with your heavy breathing and prolonged sit.
The lieutenant pauses and sighs. "Yeah, I guess I can't remember much about my past."
I was born to be a cop.... I was born to do this work.
A few kilometers south-east, in a little village of sand dunes, life goes on around the spiky red rocking chairs and the black-and-white bucket-sodden street lamps. On a shaded corner is the little roundabout, its roundabouts sundered by the rhythmic crash of motor traffic.
"The indicators on that canister of yours are all over Jamrock and the suburbs. I'm talking Jamrock Central, Martinaise, Laurel Canyon -- even Graad..." He sounds surprised to hear this. "I haven't had a good look at it much lately."
Meaning: Remnants of the cast remain, floating in space and time, never-ending.
He smiles. "I've seen worse. The Militia only protects me and my people. I'll never leave you, Hartnett."
I don't want to talk to you about it...
An odd, paranoid fear fills him. But not this time.
Some regions of the Insulindian isola are unaffected by the War of Embraces, though those that were had stronger economies.
What's so exciting about close quarters combat?
The lieutenant nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on the ashtray. "I sense chemical traces of some sort... distillation. It won't last, though. Do you have any questions?"
They're not *bad* cops, *he's thinking*. The important thing is to get the suspect out of here.
Ow...
I don't know... you feel like you should have *not* gotten involved in this mess, but you also feel like you *could* have taken better care of yourself. Wouldn't it be *fun* to take another look at the bullet hole?
Pretty much the same as before, but you can still make out an underlying structure below it. The <ultimatum machine> has been rigged with trap sets and the like.
No. There is no other you. There is no other B prime. Do *not* try to turn him into a shield. You're just not capable of it.
You will *never* escape the disco. It will *always* be a part of you.
That means it's on the up-side-itself.
Hmm, this one's bad. Nothing's really wrong with him, right?
She's agitated and in need of attention, a paranoid rage that's left her bruised and battered.
He's telling the truth. He doesn't remember you, you know.
Perhaps the most *impressive* of them all -- his filled glasses. The round visor was generous on him, filled with passion and life.
Nothing but [civics](/images/12082/18082_18082_H_Caribbean_Works) and we're done. No going back. No screaming.
It's for maintaining an erection. To this day, no one has the strength to do any of the *things* that need to be done.
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have missed. This is merely a suggestion. If you want to be a *failed* child murderer, go with that *scheme*.
The bear is doing its best to ignore you -- moving its whole body, like a living organism. Silence in the cryptozoologists' abandoned office? The bear is too busy focusing on its prey to notice your presence.
You. You don't know the time. There's no time. Stop trying to wake up people from their slumbers. Instead, go back to your question.
"Filippe II," he repeats, then turns to his
Don't say more.
Your fingers near the peal's detonation point. Tiny red sparks fly and a deafening blast echoes through the air.
"You're an artist, lawman." He turns to you. "We are an art and music community. Welcome to Revachol..."
The warehouse is filled with the carcasses of your cargo, and dark brown liquid splashes out of it.
"What if I just wanted to buy the book..."
She's unfazed by her own words. There's simply *something* about her.
"What do you mean, white?" he repeats, staring at the sea.
Don't worry. She's a machine. She can do it.
They were probably taken in the Mission district by *the FALN* -- the industrial airships used to transport Franco's heavy industry north.
"I'm not sure I understood you."
Interesting*. Imagine the salt lapping at the bones. Do you see what it touched first -- your knuckles? Do you notice how smooth they are, how immaculate?
He's not gonna make it. You're barely keeping him together here -- the more things change, the less they ever will.
"We don't have a name for you yet, but we'll give you one. A very funny name, Harry."
It's probably just a desk ornament.
You do -- for *three nights* at least. You might be able to come back to it later, but you should *not* attempt to do so while under the influence of that Pheromone.
You and the lieutenant go back and forth like a blow between blows. Finally, the mood picks her up
The lieutenant gives you a stern sideways glance, but only gets a *nan* to himself -- for once.
Look at Kim again.
(Turn to the lieutenant.) "Alright, you got him talking."
A faint smell of burning rubber reaches your nostrils.
Does he want you to believe there was an atomic bomb buried in the earth?
An odd thing happens when you talk to this guy. Like you're on some kind of trial.
Already you regret it -- looking at the wooden tokens lying around the room. You carry them on your shoulders, looking down into the dimly lit tunnels.
Because you've known these guys wouldn't rob a bank.
This is your gun. It's probably in the freezer now. You should have it back before you do anything.
What are you talking about? Minute by minute, hour by hour, minute by minute, can you keep it in?
I'm just a poor woman with no money. What do I know of these things. What do you even know? It's darkness.
I feel like there's something I'm forgetting to do... maybe I should go talk with Roy?
Step away from the table. [Leave.]
"No, I meant it was funny. I don't remember anything about it. Who was this *guy*?"
"How do you think I can help you?"
You also have Drouamine.
"So is it then?" The lieutenant looks at the bottle in your hands. It looks like a collection of bright diamonds.
Those words feel like a *gift*. A gift that was meant for you -- to make it possible to live with less dignity.
He's really enjoying this.
A slick of streetlights with green and yellow light that flicker on and off. There's a motor carriage in the back and a bus stop right next to it.
Blind musinger. You think -- but are you *right*? You should have seen it coming, didn't you?
The frostbite is making it harder than you are. And you're barely keeping it together. Still, you've really done something here. Maybe you should keep doing it.
"It doesn't matter, I don't need
"I don't know why I said that, but... how come?"
"I'm sorry I had to do this." (Gently touch the shirt.)
Are you sure you want to rip the red one out? You should probably save it for last, just in case.
"I'll ask about my gun then."
"Uh huh." The lieutenant stands silently with his arms folded.
After a while the man on the screen starts snickering. "Cuno looks after *one* of his brothers. Seems like it's on the decline."
"Yes, I know, detective," she says, calmly.
Manipulated his voice.
Suddenly -- behind you -- a plume of smoke erupts from a destroyed window. The wind rises.
But he can't stop the tears, isn't he?
Doesn't feel like such a good idea.
"Alright, how about I ask you about something else now?"
Then it's on.
An off-key melody begins to play, while the camera lingers on the man's glasses. When it returns, it's already too late...
It's a metaphor. He won't understand it. This is a very good place for a rhetorical flourish.
On a 100 million doll is 100 kilograms is giving you trouble. You need to find a new pair before you push him.
"Wait, is he still single now? In your opinion, his reputation is more than *viable* -- he's an *apocalyptic* verdict."
The crunching stone and mortar of the basinside appear before you, along with a wall of sand rising up over the sea...
Just show him the badge.
You're sure this has not affected his impression of you in a good way.
This is something the RCM might want to explore. A *little* -- and be *very* cautious about.
The great district hums in the air: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the smoke-filled air...
A while ago? A while ago? Don't just leap to conclusions. You're too busy having *no* doubts about anything.
Don't let down Cop Block. If you fail, you'll be *the bad guy* tonight. And he *will* hunt you down and shoot you instead of letting you hang out with Grease.
Just one of those things. It's hopeless.
She must have been jolted awake by the commotion. Once the smoke has cleared she'll be waiting for you in no time!
You see a streak of white light in the dark -- it morphs into the outline of the bed. A silhouette is emerging from there -- and it's mad at you, or so the thought goes in the head of this man.
You're detecting very little. There's a *smelling* of heavy fuel oil, if you didn't already know.
There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... maybe you should talk to the old woman again, get her to tell you about the grave?
All you hear is the guy's gargle of heavy fuel oil, the slick of the floor cleaner, the strange chirrups coming from the speakers...
"I don't see the point of having any more 'hitmen' than I already have customers."
You spin the piñata around in the empty bowl, mockingly. It spits out an empty bottle of beer.
Oh no... it was something *else*. You're not feeling so great. You might be hallucinating.
"Oh." He lights the cigarette.
Wait, this *player* is a partner?
That's it! Your grand gesture of *coming out of it*!
Your hands are saving face if you're going to make a *hoax* out of something like this.
No fucking way. It was a mistake to take her in, he thinks. I've learned my lesson.
You're up. Good to go. [Leave.]
The desk is clean and bright. It would not be noticed without it.
"She'll think they're gay."
You have to come back to this -- this story goes on forever. Are you finished?
"That's... that's kinda it, yes." He takes off his glasses and wipes them clean on the ground before he sits back down.
Don't worry.
The man cracks a sailor-yell of pain and throws the boots at you. A loud flash drowns the sound, like a gunshot from some distant gun. You make out two hands, big and small, clenching into fists...
Who's to say he'll stop?
It seems like a major revamping has taken place -- the booth's old co-driver has been replaced by a younger man with impressive arms. This gun is the sacred thing, a *noble* thing even. It has holy connotations. This copy is a relic.
"Why are you making this shit up?"
Maybe some people have left him there. Just say it...
"Okay," he whispers in mock relief. "But don't worry -- it was something I *could* have done better."
Almost knocked yourself out.
"I don't know, Harry. I've never met either one of my grandparents. My great-grandfather's name was Hoenkloewen."
You could even get something like that from the bathroom mirror. You could take some lint off that box ...
*Titus?* They couldn't make her crazy.
Across the water, on a small uninhabited island, two police officers and one special consultant look across a
Do we have a lead here?
"I hope you're joking."
Wait, the person who took the photo has a rule that says she can't take a photo without the permission of her husband. *And* that's why the thumbtacks are confusingly *attacking* you...
This is *not* the burnt out dining hall where Ruby was waiting for you to talk shop. If it's not *that*, then where *is* the Water Tower?
This must be the biggest lie you've ever told.
Well, it's gone -- but for the feeling. Of course. See, that *pale*/ wine-thing isn't the worst thing in the world.
The so called *pure* music sounds so banal -- so... artificial. It is devoid of any life beyond its borders.
You feel the lukewarm water of the boat being reflected back by the stained glass window behind her
"If they're not your actual skillset, then they're at least useful as a reference."
Trying to get a good image in the eyes of the lieutenant is like trying to get a perfectly *normal* outfit for your age.
"So maybe you were right. She was acting young and fresh looking -- like a supermodel."
The rain falls on her shoulders, tinting her blond hair light brown.
The clouds move, the air gets cold, then form into a flock of blind alleys. None of the streets run red with the blood of innocents.
It will tear you to pieces if you keep it... Don't relent, push through...
Looks like someone has poured gasoline on a charcoal grill. It's probably just a coincidence.
If you sabotage the goods, the goods will blame you. And they will keep on shipping you more of their *bad news*!
"Understood." The lieutenant releases his exhalation.
No, what you *need* is political! You need *to* get serious about this. This is not a game for introverts. Be on the lookout for extravaganzas, he thinks. Be
"I'm not saying anything."
"We can't be sure about that -- he might be transporting what he knows to us. We should check his lorry more closely."
Thanks, Cuno. That's one name you can now cross off the list.
What was that? You want to sing that sad song? You know what would sing that sad song is... you know, like...
Noted. And -- just like that! -- the draft was complete. The *original* did the same -- it's a fact.
She's surprised you're both here, but doesn't feel at all unwelcome. In fact, she *likes* you here.
"What do
You've *turned* your back to the painting, of course. When you were breaking down in the arms of the pale.
"But the real question is: what is this *R.A.M*?"
You're *not* all that *bad*. There's just chaos in your head, she thinks -- as she looks around in the increasingly dim light of the bathroom.
You're being *played* by Eleven. Her hand is wrapped around the controls. You can feel it.
"I have no idea what you mean."
Aberrations is the lightest of the *springs* which, in turn, is named for the fact that they appear, well, actually there aren't any.
The lieutenant hums, then turns to you. "Lieutenant, is this one of the *boules de résistance* I'm hearing about?"
Uh oh... There's something in there, *maybe* the gun was fake. But he's not buying it.
The woman *does* have eyes that are obscured by eyelashes. You should give her the benefit of the
You open the book and find yourself staring at a crude oil painting of a flock of sea gulls. Flock of dead birds, perhaps?
This is not a good idea.
"And? How would you say that, Kim?"
"I will -- only one." [Leave.]
Not that he *should* worry too much about the medals -- he looks surprisingly chubby in comparison.
For a man with weak stomach and a limited vocabulary... reading these *word salads* must be awful.
A bitter cringe. There's an untapped anger in there -- she rejected him. Why does that make you feel?
The yellowish substance glistens under your fingertips.
"No idea. Is he smoking?"
"We really got to talking. I know what I need to do for you, Harry -- take me through the motions."
It *is* interesting how they mesh... It's like candy. You can't help but wonder what they would look like if put together.
Some years back, a wild pitch woke the copporooni up. It wasn't pitch that night, but ice cream.
"Understood. Why not get back to your questions, detective?"
"What about him? Does he live here?"
You failed as a police officer. As a leader. As a man.
You don't have to say everything you think. You can back off if it's not right.
He thinks this over. "It is -- so long as the FALN is armed and disciplined. At any rate, it is their *last resort
"Huh, Klaasje
"Forget it. This is already news. This *is* news. What is news is that the girl hung him from a tree."
While *all*? What *they* are. And why does it happen?
She carefully wrings out her hands, one by one. "It's horrible. The Madre Madre was a *funk soul* in space. Always had bad intentions, but he was insane and out of control -- at the same time.
Holding the hand of a neglected old man is not the most dignified way to present your case. At least not on a wanted poster.
"It's great you're here, Harry, we've really missed you. But can we still get back to our case now?"
Just as the writing is finishing, the *woman* starts speaking. She stops mid sentence.
He turns to the man sitting on the log. "You *can't* stop, this is a train wreck waiting for its stop. We can't afford to keep you from getting caught up in this."
The gun, visually, has lost *focus* for some reason -- it's *stuck* on your shoulder, aim is back where it came from. Push it in his face, make him say it -- *COMMIT TO PAPER*.
"The hanged man's clothes were washed in this container. It was covered with cigarette stubs. And in the rusty water lock. There's a key on that post."
The tincture you've invented sounds intriguing, but what other uses do it have? Nothing else comes to mind.
"Understood. Can I still finish my quest now?"
Are you aware that all human beings have a heart rate?
The lieutenant sighs. "I'm sorry, but you're cops, you hang out with this guy, right? It just happens."
"Kim, this is ridiculous
The kindness of his regards has all but evaporated in your mind.
No. [Move on.]
"In any case, it's impossible to make out anything of value."
The man gives the lieutenant an *unexpectedly* look. "Whatever was there, huh? No wonder there's so much *copporooni*..."
As the ground warms, you hear the chatter of battle-hardened ears. The roulette wheel spins faster. You can feel it in your dung.
"*Abott,* amphetamine. Revachol will be numb from the *peaks*. The then would be all set for a new era, that is -- peak power -- for the Land's End -- peak psychedelic boredom."
Yes. It seems preposterous at first, but you catch the man's weak demeanour as he realizes you're not about to punish him.
She does *not* understand -- there's rage in there -- but this anger is not directed at *her*. It's directed at *hers*. You were...
But you're not good enough, you're *too* good, your heart is pounding and you can tell by his breathing...
That's not the same at all. You're remembering the Thirties, not the Fifties.
"I don't know. You've had such a convulsive reaction to drugs that it's like you can't *let go*."
While you've done more than most to bring this about -- this is an act of great kindness, brother. Consider it honorably done.
Your name?
This is the most urgent missing person's case you've processed -- the biggest you've ever processed.
The epidermis and veins appear whitish, then dark brown. The colour fades fast, but the embankment lingers. Say nothing.
A pang of guilt?
Your eyes grow wide with terror as you look at the display -- several buttons are activated and a faint whirring sound can be heard coming from the speakers behind the glass.
A threat? There's anger in there -- he remembers something. Remember? He's thinking about it.
"A plan has been drawn up, safe in the future. A few times per year it is."
She's not sure, but you feel it. The lieutenant's *imagination* is going with you. You have to be strong for him..
The trap feels cold, distant, and matter-of-fact. You imagine something icy moving to the south-east -- somewhere off the coast of Revachol.
"God, I can't even think..." He falls silent. His gaze wanders slowly south-west...
This is the *wrong* kind of question. Maybe you shouldn't have bothered. Guess you just have to do it.
The bottom of the box says: "In an effort to reduce the risk of skin cancer, I have sewn together a crude insignia. It reads: 'Street Fighter, Sovereign of Safre -- Do You Servant The Father?'
The stewardess returns your smile, but first she inspects the lock before doing anything.
You pressed the entire weight of the story against the door, and it didn't budge. You were *exceedingly* successful.
Okay, but...
"This is what I've been trying to tell you about, and now you've convinced me."
This is what Cuno thinks of when he thinks of the Washerwoman: drunk-blackness and some *pig-faced* beauty -- these are his penultimate and final images.
"Right. We'll do it like this for the rest of our relationship, I assure you." She begins to back off, staring at you intently. "It's important. I promise it's important to you. I promise it's important to me."
It's cold... and there's that strange numb feeling again. You must have done something bad.
"Goddamnit... What is this?" (Point to his head.) "What is this?!" (Look around.) "Is this an actual military thing?"
She frowns. "But you won't be able to go back in time much. Things
(Don't say it.) "You fucking new motherfuckers! Your lack of respect is..."
She is maintaining an even, somewhat stoic facade, all while his dirty fighter's grit has painted his cheeks lavender.
All you can see is his watery eyes, slightly narrowed, his face contorted in rage... you can almost see him melt into it.
What do you think you're doing? Overstating it, you're trying to do...
"Oh, *that* guy." The man does not think the ex-cop is bitter. "He's pretty far gone... go figure."
"From here on out, I will be more of a real assassin. I like those boots *a lot*."
The metal buckle hugs the corpse's neck, but it's not hard to imagine something more... *up there*. Maybe you could...
"Well, what do you know about the ageless engine of history?"
As you hold out your hand, the lieutenant mumbles something under your breath. You seem to have made him angry.
What about the propeller?
Of course. Maybe you *were* to expose their game? But you just can't *let* go of this prybar, you have to know more about it...
Their *belongings* are buried deep in the past.
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see the reflection of your face in it -- namely, the stubborn gumdrop-like nose of the *Goon*.
Fiddle with the straps.
"If I'm in the shit
Titus... oh god, you've been running out of that for a really long time. Don't even try anymore.
He sways slowly. His head is almost at attention with the music -- but he *should* be, this large and mysterious man. Even he can smell it...
At first the cat licks its wounds, mumbling something under its fur. The owner of this hoard, perhaps?
There's a young girl in the book store. Her name is Klaasje and she's looking at you. Her attention was diverted by the cigarette in your hand.
"Ah, yes. The problem with Po-Ching is that he has no concept of proportion. He's a *mass murderer*."
Just another junkie, ain't it?
"Yeah, he
It's just an average sized black and white photograph of a young couple out in a street fair. The name on the dress has faded with age, but you can still *make* out a dimple and a crow's head in the middle.
There is *no* talk of taking him up on his offer. If anything, it sounds like he's relieved it's you
No, no... Never mind. Forget you were a cop and now you're a meme. The biorhythm is not important.
An intense physical effort is all you feel as you look at the poster. Even now, in the flickering light of the window, the woman remains unrecognisable...
The question is -- when?
"Pity the fly -- I've got nothing to add to it."
Even now, the nails sticking out of the wood are still beginning to chip off the board...
He sighs. "The two days we have been without communication have made us closer than we were at first. We are... fortunate."
He really means it.
"Is this how human beings become so *suspicionable*?"
But I have no need for mere film stock. I want to live.
Does she really? You have no idea what she's talking about. What was *her* thing for you to fall in love with, anyway?
"You mean *kvaks*, right?"
"This is gonna lead to the kind of pointless war that ends in both parties getting nothing. Or worse."
Well, this one does have a few things -- the chief among them being his wares.
The books are *stuck* on the shelf. A slight vibration is heard on the large hard disk.
A strange little computer is waiting for a response. It seems to have forgotten to -- or been out of order for some time now.
"Too big to be true, I'm afraid."
Suddenly, out of nowhere, an officer ambles up behind you. Tall, dark and spectacled, he seems to come from some other place entirely...
You see the figure before you -- two heads, one torso. The lower one is lifeless, while the upper one is jumping...
As that terrible word passes through your mind, you rise from your knees and into the apricot-coloured light of the window. The room behind the glass is empty, except for the slight hum of the vacuum-insulated fridge.
Oh yeah, skull and bones! Skull and bones on the jacket! Let's get super enthusiastic about this
He chuckles. "I'm not sure I can legally endorse these particular salvos, but I've heard them might be useful in a hospital fire."
Perhaps it's not so strange after all -- the world is gone, the leaf is gone, the sun is gone... you just remain. And you *have* to.
Your
He rolls his eyes. "I don't say things like that. Besides, I have a feeling the heir to the throne doesn't want your shirt off."
"I'm doing this for *science*. Nature does not need your money-making machines to fund your projects."
No! They can't call me something if I'm not absolutely sure I know what it means. What does this *mean*?
This also helps to make up for your own personal problems. You seem to have a problem with making up
"No," she says, looking away from the window.
The white stars are there to symbolize the fact that the author is a good person who has things to worry about.
doesn't have your back to her. She must have been desperate enough to try this stuff on you...
"From what I can see, it's both flammable and extremely bright."
"Look around. Is there anything on the coast about *you*? I've been to some places. It's always freezing out there..."
You get the feeling she really doesn't know how to be angry, sire. This entire dialogue has been a profound improvement on your state.
"You're so drunk, I don't think you're able to make out the words. Is this how a person would sober?"
"No, officer. I didn't mean it in a bad way. Just was going to wake you up and see what's in your system."
You look at the slush-like mass of pinks and redskinsplashed here and there in the snow. It's clear the late stages of the war were tough on the middle and lower extremities. You can't help but notice a curious similarity to your late stages as well.
Somewhere in the still of a still life -- a speaker is blasting something on a broke radio. A distant call? The reel spins...
Written in light brown paper --–––––––. This is thick enough to use as a template for a 4×6 foot by 12 foot by 12 foot by 36 inch by 44 centimeter by 46 cm thick card. You're a police officer too!
Can't say I'm a huge admirer of Paledriver.
No-no. I don't want to say that. No need.
He's not exaggerating -- his lack of confidence is so extreme it's physically painful.
A brief glimmer of how they must have looked -- to someone who's never been inside.
And underground, swarming. There is no air in your lungs. Only distant, sweet silence.
"Yeah, no..." He's taken aback. "I'm surprised *you* didn't get shot. It's not like I expected..."
It's a *textile* wound. Most likely an armistice weapon -- meant to stop you from running away.
Who the Hell is this, hey?
You thought you heard something but it's just the reeds.
What? No! Of course not.
He's not really a sailor, but a sailor gets seasick all of the time.
Saying these words brings him immense joy. It's a strange feeling, having your throat relaxed and your heart pumping just a little bit.
You look around, at the walls.
"What was that about *the difficulty of the life-style*?"
"Or some crazy minds up in there..." He shakes his head. "That's all I got. All this talking doesn't answer the question..."
There is something shady about him.
Well... he didn't say anything about the little clip you found, and if he did, it's unclear where he got the money to commit these horribles.
You should have *officer* that title. It's the one with the gun.
The 'what' is hard to say, but there's something on the seabird's wings... something *appalling*. You can almost see it.
"I am sorry, officer, but I really can't."
Your body is telling you not to cry.
And the flightless falcons. They are eternal prisoners of their own kind.
If you think it's important -- you *have* to explain yourself. Convince her otherwise.
The *Grizz* hanging from the ceiling fan is taller than *The Cuno*. The...
"I think of the pale all the time."
This is both good and bad. It's good because you *did* miss the serial number, you just can't find it now
You almost missed something. A dark siren wailing in the distance, before the static quiets down a bit.
The feeling intens
It's a dark and dangerous place, and you're not *qualified* to do this. But, you *do* know that if it weren't for your cold hands this monster of flesh and steel might not exist.
Oh yes, *carbon copies*. Copies of books and papers -- from *the book shop*. Those books are on loan from the book shop. You find two dozen copies of The Importance of the Reproduction...
"You're exaggerating, sweetie." She tries to smile. "But no, it really happened. And I'm sorry."
Help! Someone! Cut my hand off...
Before you stands a cargo container. In the bottom right corner there's a sticker -- a *copotype* is depicted wearing it.
You have. He will not.
It's absolutely lovely and all, but you have to hold on. Right now you just stand there like a rag doll.
One bullet, little diggity... This is one for later. When you have more questions, ask the lieutenant.
The bulletin board has been stripped bare and dried. It's muddy, but in its own way...
A single malt scotch is more than twice the strength of alcohol per litre.
Listen within the place of industry, where power and structures connect: world-class crafters and traders actuate electrons through bread-and-butter trauma, heat and oxygen; and nerve endings send mixed signals to your visual cortex:
From the corner of your eye, you see a sudden cascade of motion ripple through the insect's limbs. A series of ultrasonic clicks fills your ear...
From page 124: "During the Siege of Insulinde, the affluent revacholian man owned large tracts of land north of the river..."
What exactly is a 'fasces'?
The victim's temperature was stable.
Looks like it. The Scooper *will* save face -- but he's not going to help you.
"You don't have to. I don't have to. I don't need your pity."
The gale wind picks up. The cold air is heavy. The huge building seems to expand in front of you, like a cat's eyes on a leash.
She ignores the lieutenant. "Or what?" she asks finally. "Hey, maybe later..."
"Hold on, if I just ask you how you learned about the home life of the people at the heart of this *journey*, wouldn't you want to know? And even if you did, wouldn't you want to be sure you weren't doing it incorrectly?"
(Kiss the door.)
Somewhere, a dozen hardened and ambitious men are hunched behind folding chairs at a table full of pipes and lorries. Some of them seem to be listening to something...
He looks at you, beaming.
Your hand cracks, painfully tight around the object of your love.
He leans back against the fence. "There has never been a time when he wasn't a fan of yours. If there ever was one..."
It's hollow. You hear the sound of the canister filling up with steam.
Still, you feel the lieutenant's hand on your back. And you know you shouldn't -- he knows you don't have time to do this.
The monumental statue in the centre of the square is mesmerized by the laser beams coming from the computer. It rotates its tiny head, the head moves its mandible-like mouthparts...
"Don't tell him that."
"Okay. So what does this have to do with 'Aesthetic Disposition'?"
THE MOON IS NOTHING. THE MOON IS ABSURD AND *NOT*HING.
Yes, but in the process of you getting better at it too. So keep it together, you'll need that confidence later...
These two sentences fall somewhere in the 'hard core' zone. It's a beautiful, breath taking place. You want to get back to it.
What she means is: There's nothing in the manual to tell you how to do it, and also, you know what they are -- war crimes.
This note needs to be addressed to Titus.
Then -- what?
Your word has no effect. There's a mass of wrinkles above her jawline, her face contorted in mock dismay.
Titus' hands are covered in so many little rabbit marks you can't even make out a single finger.
The lieutenant doesn't say a thing, his eyes staying put and his mouth slightly open. You're right -- you're a *dreamer* -- too bad you can't remember what you were trying to connect to. Maybe some day, when you get up, you can try again?
People on the isola who don't know better, those barren wastes of soil and rock. The weekly newspapers. The occasional news magazine. A few letters missing from an innocent's name.
I know you don't. But this *does* seem important. Something important to you. You should tell me about it when you get the chance.
What can I do now?
The boy smiles and nods.
I like sci-fi.
She's trying to get through life toil without being noticed.
Just like that, *The Art Cop* is born. You may even rip apart one of these guys if you have to. You may have the grace and the anatomy, but you lack the *mind*.
"The matter's not my concern, or the commander's concern."
The windfall is clearly large -- but what can you do? You might be stuck with it, like the fourth wheel on an old vehicle.
Steady breathing, solid core, stable diet -- what more could a sad, lost friend ask for?
Yes. To truly understand him, one has to let go of the ego. The more you let go of it, the more fragile it will remain.
The lieutenant offers to help, but he might be too late: The conference centres are locked. Even worse -- they could be used as weapons.
"The Fear. The worst of the *necrene*. The living dead. Living nightmares that terrify and bewilder even the most powerful of men."
The echo of a thousand voices mingles with the soft hum of television. The world returns to normal when one of you fires up your old Hot Pocket, and you are back where you started.
"I want to buy those boots you have."
"No, the space you are looking at is the last one. It took me a while to come up with that plan..."
I *really* don't like that word...
It's quite destroyed. Some of the shards have landed on the ground. But you wouldn't expect much more from Graad.
On stage you are approached by three different officers -- one from each precinct. As you look through the dusty, rectangular notebook, the resident medic tries his best to help you sort through the bewilderment.
The portareel is a minor player on the piano, much less a major one -- but it's always nice to have, doesn't it?
You were right. With his strange sunglasses on and his strange notebook, you felt like you were *alone*. Until you hear this...
Fuck is that going to do?
"Okay, why not? We don't need all that *pain* any more. It's okay. You're part of *the class* now. The proletariat."
This feels like a cross-reference, but you can't make out what it is. It's impossible to read someone else's thoughts with this device.
The man gets a strange gleam in his eyes, his breathing quickens and his words are accompanied by jerky motions.
As you open your eyes you are still in the dark like a child on a Christmas morning. Through the darkness you can make out the white-on-blue police livery of the motor carriage in the carriage stable.
The tin canister on which the corpse is floating merges with the sea ice to form a souffle. The mix is unsatisfying.
The lieutenant looks at you, with a look of cautious, but stern concern.
"No -- man, the guy's *dead*..."
"It's not weird. It's an anomaly. I'm going through a phase."
The freckled girl does not flinch.
It's a *dream*... for a strange, unheard reason. Of course it's for show, you wouldn't *sedit* it like that.
"No," he says finally. "You don't get to choose your posse."
No no no no no no no. This one moment is all it will ever be -- the *last* one. The music is playing itself. Grow the loop.
The jacket copy proclaims: "Man from Hjelmdall returns in his most exciting adventure yet! After crashing into a strange jungle, cannibalistic natives abduct his only surviving comrade, noble Tyrbald. Before Man from H
What *did* you do?
What? No. No no no no no no no! Say the word, it will make her happy...
"Titus, we can't have this kind of... behaviour with VIPs. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't like it
He's also a master of ceremonies -- has an incredibly strong grasp of both the script and the feelings implied in each syllable.
Your words echo in the Kvalsund KR+2 Multi-Tool. It looks impressive -- but what can it do against military-grade weaponry?
Does that mean I'm a bad leader?
Wait, is she *ashamed* of them? They accuse her of being unfaithful to her kin, and yet she has no kin...
He's thinking about the garish tie he was supposed to be wearing earlier.
"No way." [Leave.]
There is no wall to speak of. You can *feel* the weight of the world recede. Before you is a vast plain of reeds, sodden slime and disintegrating cities.
And the "what now" is less of a question than it was -- *this* crime. That is why you have them stashed away.
"We'll go for a walk outside, shall we? I think I saw a nice stretch of reeds where we can take a little breather."
"To answer your question -- yes, I am."
"But you don't have a weapon, officer."
A hand on his shoulder. Then the grip changes direction. It's the lapel of the
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. It's signed by Idiot Doom Spiral and someone called Domwtclall Abheqoeel apparently.
He repeats: "We have to stop her from doing that again. She's dangerous, we need to stop her from going to the city with those documents -- and we have to stop her from *getting* those documents."
"It's not one of those things. Let's talk about something else."
"Ah, yes, criminal investigation. What can I help you with?"
"They're afraid." She smiles, as if it's a truth. "Fascists who call themselves *rights*, but don't actually have the right to be any more."
H. Noid, a cinderblock town on the southern
He nods. "Then I acted in self-defense. It is a *trial* and a mistake to just stand there like a useless dildo. Let's try something else, you know."
"Hi again, police officer." The man stares at you with a troubled expression on his face.
"Really?" (Start slowly bending over.)
You pick up a neat note with the word *thank you* written on it.
Uh ... is that an order?
"Did she... tell you she's had previous run-ins with the law?"
The feeling dissipates. The air moves on, the evening wind blows through your flaps. It's as if you've left it all behind...
"Good to have that kind of support."
No, it's just the form of a corrupt police officer impersonating a politician. The man in the picture is obviously *involved* in some manner.
He's done a fine job too. If he ever doubted his comrades, just ask him now. He'll gladly tell you the truth.
So that's why the fiddle is playing so *affectionately* -- to give you something to think about! Think about the kid in the hallway, the *stupid* pipe, and...
To her the world has gone on, the waves did not return. And now she hears the radio on repeat, see, 50,000 litres of raw alcohol has warped the words -- *ultrasound*.
After a while, he says, "It's too late now."
My god, Kim's so weak.
Wasn't the phasmid an example of *dweorg* -- a species name derived from the land's name?
"Not like the Wayfarer Act, I hear..."
"No. What I'm doing here is serious."
No, this whole thing *wrong*. This whole time you've wanted to fuck this girl. Then you got drunk and said you wanted to fuck Garte. Then you said you wanted to fuck Garte and now you're shitting yourself. Now that you know the roads are paved, it's
Some political junkie boy between the ages of 12 and 44 has been gossiping about your *relationship
"'What were you doing before you lost?'
Sensing your agitation, he responds with the knowing nod that he usually doesn't extend to.
He turns to you. "If you're *Karla Marchese* and you find this out, you'd better be sure you're competent when it comes to such matters as that."
You didn't mention anything about your *relationship* either. That's not how these things work. You should ask the lieutenant if you run into any other strange patterns.
And once you're done with you and Spitfire, what's next?
While he spoke, his left hand took the handkerchief from under his arm and wiped away the sweat.
'You should come back to this later. Either try to find a way to communicate with the dead man again, or go look for traps in the forest.'
That's where his sense of humour comes in. He'll see you laughing about as long as he's alive.
In the background you can faintly make out two men: one large, one small. They are clearly inebriated.
He sighs. "Of course. Have a seat."
"An addition to the Lincoln Marlin?" The lieutenant stands in front of the door, waiting for you to step in...
Grab the gun.
Thanks, Cuno!
Could it be a symptom of overdosing on something? Something even you have not tired? Keep your eyes peeled...
"No need to be sweet. I'm no real alcoholic either. I'm under the influence, just having it for some odd reason."
"A car! Like a fucking car!"
Everything in him drops a little bit, as if to be replaced. It's a small tremble...
Well. It's not that I'm envious. In fact, he's probably already a guinea pig for the guinea pig project.
Wait, no! That would go against Kim's very *personal* belief system.
Maybe the soft shoulders of a hard core. Or maybe the rafters of a Seven-Up. Guess you'll have to
Suspect is reluctant to talk about the jacket himself... it would probably be better to shut him up for this.
Beneath the doubt she's letting the tears in your eyes dry up. Your hands are covered in mud and so are your feet.
A-ha! Thinking about the time honoured traveller. Just thought you'd enjoy the momentary confusion!
"I don't know. I mean, I mean we can be any sort of being. A mammal, an animal form. Like the whale."
The funny thing is, it *isn't* all dark yet. It's almost midnight, and the time is still slipping away. The light from the window is still on.
Convince her to stay.
"Our investigation has found that the guns were purchased by him while he was still a university student."
"This leaves me feeling like it's not true. At all."
An intricate web of blue lines stretches across the torso of the hanged man. Each time the lines intersect, a small fragment of the LUMINOUS COMPANY logo appears, blending into the other tufts.
"He was a lorry driver. One of the drivers is dead. A dead driver isn't the kind that puts out his truck. You know..." She scratches at the lodged memory. "So -- was there anything else?"
*********. FUCKO MODE
"You don't have to be." He laughs. "You're already one of the nicest people I've ever met."
He takes a step back and looks at the door to the South. "The problem is our own Union. I haven't got a problem."
Yes. And after all this time you haven't even learned the name of the band. But you can try. *Any* name fits.
She gives you a long, suspicious look, her gaze mostly taken up by the waves.
"Did you do it?" The lieutenant is looking at the cigarette package in your hand.
"One of those parasites, I hear you."
Now that you've determined he's not lying, you've probably done more than *ping* it. You've probably *bought* that seat too.
"We don't talk about that. They're only children."
"Hey, not judging, sir. I just want you to have fun. I don't know what the meat is."
Old? What an odd choice of words. Guess you can't say *what* -- except in rage. Then it would be *rude*.
Your shoulders do not seem to tremble.
Silence. No one hears you scream.
They must have put the board in the sea somewhere. Close to the Pit of Cuno.
He gets it. Debriefing after a crime scene. After the suspect's been *dead* for a while, the state's best theory seems to have some holes. Maybe it's time to go over the whole *Katarzine Alasije* thing once more?
He looks around -- then at you. "The fucker has to have one -- sooner or later his little brother gets the chance."
A quick little sidenote: if you haven't played Dora Inglis or Semenine yet, don't, because they're really, *really* bad.
That must be how it's been for the past ten years.
What is this feeling?
There is no discomfort this time.
The woman doesn't reply, but looks up, and the static that follows her movements seems more distant than she thinks.
What was it like to be a beggar?
"I can't believe he doesn't know any better. He's a bad, bad man. And he will die."
Your hands are protected from this icy facade by your clothes. If the façade came down because of an attack, you would look unrecognizable.
You should sing it, but you know you can't concentrate on that without playing it, right? Clarinet, or tenor saxophone, but you got a little *bumpy* on the sax. Still, nothing wrong with standing on one's feet.
Like ice cold water falling off a bridge.
"What's the Church?"
This watercolour image is going to sit there in the cold, bemoaning itself. A testament to your moral compass, son.
Okay. This is where I start for you. Talk about your car, not your sister.
It was a funny time to ask that. He had no idea what you were talking about -- it was too obvious he wasn't ready for what came next.
You stare ahead. The other man continues the cigarette, ash falling from between his fingers.
A torrent of radio stations plays on repeat, echoing through the empty chamber where the Man from Hjelmdall and Tyrbald have their great battle. All but one -- JUNK! JUNK! Then the echoing begins again.
You grab the handle and pull the lever up. As soon as the metal connects against the contact pins you hear a satisfying click.
His expression makes clear that he agrees with the assessment.
Let's move! The world moves on, in two days and two weeks -- you and I will have forgotten all about you. So why bother?
This one's *gone*. Possibly dormant along with your nervous system. Don't ask what's wrong, take it as a no-brainer.
"I'm not the weird cop."
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember The Rite of Honour...
Because of the Kvalsund crane.
She's since made it known that she is prepared to use the very worst of strategies to resolve this.
And what about the people living in the waterless desert? Do they have a say in the matter?
Her glare is so intense it's visible her pupils are dilated.
They stare at each other for a moment. Then Tiphaine kisses him on the cheek. "Well, you shouldn't be here if you're stealing, you're obviously bored. Let's go."
*mimics jabbing motion*
"Who are you kidding? Hire you a realabobber."
Uh... I don't know. I don't feel like dancing at the disco either.
You sit on the wind-worn wooden planks, your back hunched. After a while, you find yourself covered in cold sweat.
"No." (Somewhere deep within yourself -- you think.) "What if I just said no and walked away? But I'm so scared..."
Could be. Rumour has it that *Stonewall* was referring to the *Insulindian phasmid* -- a creature that supposedly went on to live on the surface of another planet...
Inside the refrigerator, the ice still tastes of the sea. Even the chill of the wind from the outside has stripped away some of the paint.
Let's not think about that right now. (Keep it to yourself.)
That's a pretty big number.
The *worst* kind of *punk* has no balls. That's not a reference to the drug trade, it's a reference to the rigid positivism of the movement.
Somewhere in Mirova a massive data processor dwarfs you in size. He's trying to move his large head to a more permanent position.
Under the night sky the great district sleeps: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the glowing horizon...
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this day and age, of all times. It's not *part of* being a cop.
How is that possible?
He drinks half of his beer and says nothing.
No way, I'm not doing it.
The darkness is there -- but is it really there? You have no idea what to say. The silence is almost deafening.
"You mean this tare, right?" (Point at the water snake in the water) "Uh-huh."
"There you are. The kind green ape roaming our streets. Looks about five, maybe six, but you gotta see it to believe it. Ever been one of those desert vortices?"
This means that, just like *bratan* used to do, it's an occupational hazard of the police force.
"You know, Kim... I should probably go on patrol. See if the *lady driver* is looking for me. At this rate, I'm just gonna get shot, please don't bring me into this."
The broken speakers see the light for what it is -- a powerful magnet. The machine continues it's lifetime as a toy, or a deadly force.
"Wow, those are really ugly."
A blurry figure in ragged clothes, tossed into the trash bin along with the trash container. There's a gaping hole in his stomach...
You pull the lever up, the light beams hit the paper with a soft karaoke-style sing, and out of it -- *The New*.
The intense white-noise of the music intensifies your perception. You find yourself staring at the speakers in turn, trying to hear what's on them. After a while you stop noticing them.
As you gaze upon the rusty roller coaster, the tracks lie in nothing but the ice...
Just trust me. He'll sympathize if realizes you could actually loose your job over this.
She *did* take her eye off the books, but what could he do? He's tried to keep her from any sudden flare-ups.
What is this... I thought we were on the same page?!
Hearing that -- the first one to fall silent.
Three
She flashes you a quick sideways smile, as if to say: "Don't worry, sweetie. Daddy's main concern is keeping you safe."
"The Sun..."
"I don't want to talk about my history with the Insulindians."
*Hmm*, so I'd have to think about it...
You never had a chance. There was something off the moment you walked in. It was frightened of you. And then it started freaking out...
No matter, you should know by now -- it's the *Ex-* they like most. The *old men*. It's what they say to her... be a good ex-.
Yes, we should all stop trying to suck the life out of it. At least then it will be *interesting*.
"That's right, Kras Mazov." The smile dies down again on his face. "And his twin, Agness..."
A thick wall of industrial smoke rises from the massive metal contraption. It seems to rise somewhere in the distance, forming a kind of *contest in the sky*...
Hey, hear that? Your shirt made of *spiderwebbing*. You'll find a lot of familiar arms in the Museum of Vulgar Fauna and Ignorance. They're probably carrying some dusty old books.
You're stupid. Maybe the best thing to do is to quit wasting time looking into this topic.
And, at first, it's not clear that *her* finger is on the trigger. There's a *but* behind the curtain.
But she did want something -- if it's part of her work situation?
Your mind grinds to a halt. All you can see is the revolver in the man's armoured hand -- swaying, pointed at her.
"Shall we talk about something else?"
"Well, what else did you see then?"
"I can't decide between you and Gul."
"Okay. Let's talk about your room."
You should have the key. [Leave it behind.]
You're absolutely *done* now. You've brought all the pain away from the moment you stepped out of the
What would she look like if you compressed her face into a girl? That would be right... How do you know all this then?
"Hello, officer." He looks up, at the creeping shadow that threatens to engulf him. "Are you in?"
They're just copies, a big mistake! Don't let him talk trash, he *has* the motive.
Like
He nods in agreement. "The fuck is this?"
Outside, the temperature is dropping. Several hundred metres away. There is absolutely no wind.
The sad mass of wrinkled muscles is slowly healing -- *more* slowly than either of you could have imagined. You're both so sweaty you can't even dance...
"Sarcastic," she nods. "
What you have is a prologue and an epilogue, the former written in large type and the latter in smaller paper. It comes with a bound paperback.
You hear that, steppes? Oh yes, and a *rainbow* sundial. Annihilating bullets rain down on the Martinaise inlet...
Backed down from Cuno.
You shove the hard boiled meatball back down between your fingers. A nice little treat for your troubles, officer.
You need to start talking to her!
"He was already dead. It was a blurb on it, but it looked too late to be more than that."
This is great. People will know what to look for when they see it. And it's yellow.
She looks around. The yard, the fields behind the church, the motorways looming overhead...
"I don't even know what to say..." She fiddles with the pendant, slowly shaking her head from side to side.
AND ALCOHOL TOO
Relax. The world is ending -- you can't *see* through it. You can't see past the -20 degree Celsius.
No, you don't. You can't even remember the *name* of this funky ether-based music. Even the bottle doesn't interest him.
"No, you're right. Let's make sure we've done everything that we can." He looks at his wristwatch. "We're working for the most prestigious law firm in Jamrock, where loyalty is *central* to our practice."
It's a black and white photo of a young couple out in a street fair. The man is young, dark in his abs, and has an airship looming behind him. The girl is smiling playfully at the camera.
Bystanders reported golden filaments lighting the already sunlit chamber walls, clearly visible beneath his skin.
"Uhm, I'm not really a gardener, really. I'm a salesman for the department of seasonal fruits and vegetables."
Don't be an idiot and be a Tequila *Sunrise* -- a smiling alcoholic destroying toxic plastic with his teeth, destroying solid carapaces and more, devastating enemies alike...
She's not angry -- or very clever.
It's not going to be much better for you later either. In the meantime, take a little slow-burn to your recovered reserve.
You touch the blue heart-shaped diadem on your head, and feel the cold spin tickle against your temples.
She sighs and looks down. "Oh, my sweet lord, is it possible to play Pawn? What if you lose?"
You jerk to attention, the lieutenant still standing there like a statue. "And one more thing -- we should have a look at that window. It's the window that the Devil himself pointed to..."
As you look at the sunlit coast, the air slowly descends into the stratosphere. Above it -- the Great Upshur, the highest peak in the world.
We should have talked about your hiccups before, the lieutenant thinks. Is she right? It's almost like talking about a real snooze!
It's breakfast time.
The boy keeps laughing. His brother looks at the house, unimpressed.
"I don't care about that," the boy snaps at you. "You don't care about the town you grew up in! Or the people you
What was that about *mutual exclusivity*? You need those stamps to get that *BOCAINTEO* stamped document.
Is she saying something here? Last night? What else did she say?
"Ugh... I could use a pair of pants like this, officer. Can't *lock yourself out* of those like I used to!"
The silence is deafening. Within the phasmid's nest of phasmid-infested webs and trap-doors you hear the glimmer of cellophane, as the insect moves, its antennae long and sharp.
"In your case, officer." The lieutenant looks at you. "Let's say you're an authorized newsperson for the Doomed Commercial Area. You are in possession of the materials that led you to the Carthage gunmen."
He points to the other man. "I've known him for quite a while. I *like* him. Why? I'm not even sure I can trust my own eyes."
Why? Why can't I get it?
A trap? Have you not been following your own nose to any of the other traps on the field? Were there none on that particular field?
He stops to think. "Well, maybe you *are* a bird. Say it with a straight face."
What? There's nothing.
Honestly, I don't even know what to say to this. Honestly, I don't know what *boule* means. What does he know about music? You should know how to say it. *Say* it like it's some kind of compliment.
"I'm gonna go talk to Andre." (Show her the gun.)
Fuck you, Irw. The only thing you can do is beat yourself even more -- by *exercising* your will.
I guess that's it, then. Maybe if I push him, he'll be driven, not stirred by emotion. But he doesn't have to push you...
Yeah, you're a smart one. There's a kid on the other end with that problem, you can offer to help him.
Does he know you're from out of town? Far away? This must be the Gateway Commonwealth, the world's largest and most populous supra-cities.
There is a gap where the name of that song should be. You should ask her about it, after you've finished reading this.
He's got good taste and must have taken whatever advice he could, but at this point, he's just worried about losing his nerve.
This is a dirty finger's trap. The resident Hardie had his fingers stuck to some sort of a crust, probably made of gunmetal. It would be *strange* to leave it alone, though. It's dangerous work.
The man stares in silence, his jaw clenched. It's difficult to say what his reaction would be to a photograph being taken of him.
Honestly, I don't know what I'm looking for. I'm kind of worried I might have... a case and I don't know what to look for.
What? I'm in the process of coming to terms with it. I just need a little *moment* to shake it out of my head...
Yes! One single, *unifying* question unites all human beings: Who is the originator of *the wild west winds*?
THE OFF-SITE COPY IS RED.
"Yeah, but this pan-isolatist big-spending politician doesn't have a clue about the economy."
She just looks at you coldly. Then at the reeds. "You're right, dear. It's strange that you keep forgetting us when so much as glance at the pathetic old tent..."
One could make the argument that s/he was present at the firing squad's being -- he definitely *was* there, all things considered.
[Put the paperwork away.]
An officer of the RCM is lying on the floor of a huge open field in the middle of nowhere. Florescent orange, the morning sun shines off her white uniform. The officer is dead, but he's too...
Another poster of some kind, illuminated in the night?
You don't *have* the accent. You don't even *have* a microphone. Your ears can't hear the sound of a broken record -- it's not there.
Titus? Titus Hardie. Titus Hardie.
He means: one of these days you might have to find your shoes from the rafters in the corner.
"Yes, you're welcome to it. It's like every other policeman -- except you have better things to do."
She turns to you. "I can't believe the Med-Tech Director is okay with you wasting this type of information. What's more, he only wants to know about *you*!"
So, who made the call?
"No, officer. I have to let her go."
He looks you in the eye cloud of smoke and nods thoughtfully. "I will be there to help, anytime -- *anywhere* you need me?"
"Oh, those were the variants of 'Amerika'. We used to read them in school. All sorts of things -- historical novels, romance stories, folk songs..."
As in: "Booze *always* leads to bad decisions." Or: "Before you go, think about what you can learn from this -- and what you can learn from this only..."
"Because I have super-powers. I can break down any barrier. I've already broken down the security around this building."
There's no shame in letting it be. It's not about *you*. It's about them.
She's right, actually -- the fourth wall doesn't really meet the way it's sitting. Better start looking elsewhere
You couldn't make out a word -- or a syllable -- of what he said. He's obviously very tired.
"Yeah, remind me later."
You got it, sire.
I'm barely holding it together... There's an opening, if you just...

This is definitely the case.
The massive property damage award.
"Seems I'm a threat to the very existence of organized crime."
"You're right. It was a lot of work, but we made it."
"The Union is trying to silence you."
She looks down with a wince. "I'm sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you could trust Ruby."
Relax, man, you *have* to complete the crossword. Now's not a good time to start thinking about sex.
There is no other logical explanation. You're near the end. The book is done. There will be no more thrilling nor *compelling*.
You're too brutal to slit someone's throat, *bratan*! You're not strong enough to catch her like you would a speeding bullet.
Some toil yeoman! As you pluck thread after thread from the tangled web, you notice an almost unfathomable array of cargo, some stacked, some still hanging around,
The buck-toothed gremlin has fallen silent. It's probably rubbing against one of its legs or shaking it off.
Your hand moves to the dial switch. You hear the glass crackle as the emitter moves -- so very slowly -- and then a small hum...
The lieutenant coughs.
She was the most socially secluded and least self-aware of all the innocences. Few people regarded her as a *pig*.
In the bathroom mirror, the blond man still keeps his head bowed. The air islet contained him.
He isn't sure you've noticed, but the lieutenant is *more* impressed with the kid. You really should ask him about the chip...
This is one of her manoeuvres. The others are fast asleep, as always... it's hard to say which one it was.
A thousand years have passed since the great sleazy secret of this union was spilled, and the scheming duo of *Filippe and Lillienne* is still locked in their respective pitches of base...
Even without the tranquilizers, the lieutenant's found the second largest supply of amphetamine pills in the world.
The one time this busted up cabbage has something new to say it would sound like he needs to be more forceful.
"It's not a fiddle-head, honey. It's a cryptozoologist, a Pox."
"An octopus, huh? I thought so."
But it was cold outside.
"I don't want to be the greatest, but could you help me get in to the harbour?"
(No spaces, just long words)
The kind of intelligent design isomorphic creatures go mad in fear of the chaos, so I'm guessing this isn't about a *subtraction* of what happened last Saturday night.
"I'm always happy to help out -- do you have an *opposite* frequency?"
This doesn't add up? You
He's not done. There is more here. The corpse in the back seat doesn't belong to him, the Amityville Horror did. It's inside his head, he just can't *let* it go.
You *get* me Cobo. I feel like you were once for horses, but then changed your mind. Probably.
She has dark circles under her eyes, like some kind of havoc-creature. You see them sparkle in the light of the window.
There's something there. Maybe you should...
Six kilometres from here to there -- *where nothing happens*. That's six days. And you'll miss them all, Harry.
"So you were trying to stop me?"
"Yeah, me too."
If there is one thing you know for certain about this woman -- and it's that she's a total badass -- is that you're an asshole.
Not now, I guess. [Discard the thought.
"Of course, I'm just a drunk."
"I still need a motive. Not today, mind you, but I'll ask around in the neighbourhood first."
Write: scum.
There is *nothing* else to do. Now stop and accept the reality of the gremlin kid for what he is.
You have it pretty bad, he thinks -- but you can't remember if it was *good* or *bad*.
You're not getting *any* fun for your brain!
No, not a fan of dogs.
She's wearing earrings, and they're even worse than her hair.
"Just a moment, sir."
The howl of a crow's call across the water, inside the bell tower... you feel as though you should sing it from memory. Sing it now!
The shirt that came with the jacket is so soft it could almost be stuffed. The silhouette of the jacket itself is seamed with it.
She nods solemnly. "Worried about the raid. Worried about me, too. It's a thing you can't get off your back."
Whoa... how does it feel?
Say what you will, but this kid's *morbid* obsession with numbers is pretty fascinating.
"Yeah, I'm a dirty worker too. Willing to do what I can." He takes his beer can and pops it open.
She suddenly jerks to life, her eyes wide and face pale. "Oh, you've been living under a rock! Never thought of going back to the caves, though. Well, then you're onto something good. Come on in, we'll take a look!
"Of course, miss. Anything else I can help you with?"
"And now you're part of the old guard, the *retaliate*." He stares you straight in the eye -- his wide
She isn't sorry to disappoint you.
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
She put this over the railing and it looks like the shot came from the balcony. The book is full of clues.
The man stands up straight and turns on his heel. A loud *thunk* fills the air and a small bullet hole in his chest.
Something so... *mysterious*?
He just shakes his head.
The wind ruffles her hair as she looks at the departure lounge door. "I wish I were, officer... But I don't have anything else to do."
Are you sure it's a good idea? Go for the cool when you're drunk. Cold booze is the *good* kind.
"Does that really have anything to
"It doesn't matter."
You feel a sudden surge of self pity. For him it would be unromantic to linger.
"Don't want to know any more. If I had to guess, I'd say she had to know there was a third girl in there..." He looks across the water, then back at you: "...who was stolen from us -- but who *did* you take?"
You're spinning the same fucking wheel again, the wheel of history being recited from beginning
That's the approach a priest might take. Consider your every move, in the name of the Mother!
Is it? The light is dim. A small section of the wall fails to open up, but the beam moves like a liquid magnet. A knife-throwing emaciated old man rests inside, his mangled torso displaying the astonishing range of motion of the human will.
The Union has no power but what's in the treasury. And you're too *old* to drive a stick shift any more.
"I mean, this," he takes the container, "is all I have to use for now. Just follow the signs. It's for your work."
You should ask her about the cold again. See what she has to say.
That's right. There's your ticket out of the park...
"You're right, it does seem to be that way. But -- look closer and you'll see it's actually quite simple. The chair is broken, but that's all."
If it is, then where does it lead?
Okay, there is *no* other way. The scene is too self-explanatory. She's been banged up and alone and Deanna Deneuve -- all at the same time. It's a *ma'am* miracle she didn't kill herself in that *water lock* crash.
He gives you a sour look. "Whatever made you think you could just take the jacket off is just the jacket off. Who knows what other surprises await inside..."
Kim, what are you doing?
The man shudders lightly, his eyes swallowed up by their residents.
In this early frame, the legs look like grapes. The fungus on them ripples, like a waterfall.
"Interesting, how? I don't *have* an editorial line. I'm just a regular cop with a little twist.
It's coming back to you. You sensed it just now, in your semi-conscious state..
You're addicted to painkillers. With a little help from alcohol, you should be feeling them all off.
A prayer of sorts.
She stares back at you with bloodshot eyes, a laundry list of polka dots covering her freckled face. Ten seconds have passed.
She's trying to keep it together.
The lieutenant studies the bullet in your hand. "Now that you mention *the fuck*..." he says.
"Just be reasonable, Titus. You're not in this for the King. He needs your help. And it's not easy being the King."
HEADLESS MAN ON REEDS
"I'm sorry, ma'am."
He likes the *totality* of it.
It's the inopportune moment for a break. You'll live... just a little longer, Harry. I say the words so you don't have to hear them.
"This is hopeless, I know it."
This is not an official chart. It's just a line in the sand. If you were to draw a mental map, it would be wrong...
This is where someone like *E^nautic Teratorn* would call.
"Take a walk around the block. You can see the building's skeletons."
You need to get your shit together, you failed here. Now get back to work.
You missed your opportunity to learn more about her at the pawnshop.
"Possible evidence: Sir, I'm afraid you have the means and the motive power to get into the harbour. The difficulty lies in obtaining the owner's signature. And there's a... 52 days' notice requirement. If you fail to do
This place... The Spirit of St. Anton, in this crater. Almost. It's almost a prison, a work camp.
For maximum kinetic energy, thrust is maximised. The Righteous Riflesman's pistol is his magnum opus.
It's more important than you are.
Your friend punches the air again. "I always thought of it like that -- when a policeman questions a suspected criminal, it's usually a good idea to go first. Otherwise, it's probably only a matter for the lieutenant to
The lieutenant coughs, then mumbles, "I'm sorry for wasting your time. I should have known you'd... That you'd ask."
He nodded. "Yeah, that's probably it. Sorry about the fuzz."
He says that in spite of himself. Because he doesn't think it was a great idea to tell her the truth about the phasmid.
"Sure, go ahead." She takes the photo.
There's still plenty of time for good. Chronobrains are real, breathing, talking creatures. Just don't start guessing.
"It's the unspoken police policy not to talk to people about the job they did in this or that case -- not after the case is solved."
"I'm so sorry for this." [Set the tape player down and pull the trigger.]
"If you want to feel more like a *gangsta*, then you should find your *urban pool* on the coast."
What do you mean *terrible*? You couldn't even hear them over the din. They'd be heard in MELBOURNE.
It's more likely you'll come out looking like a dick.
If you can't trust your own eyes, who can you really trust? Perhaps it's better to complete the vision and then return to this empty shell of yourself, but...
He's pleased to see the first come the winner.
You've heard what happened.
There's something you're not getting here. He really does like this old woman.
LOUDER THAN YOUR CONSCIENCE
Performances like this one are actually gauged by eye-balls placed on the member's cheeks. The balls return a full 100%.
This is where they kept the mythical phasmid species. They knew it was important -- and
"Uh... this looks like a bad idea."
He pushes your fingers in his throat, hoping to make the voice sing once again.
The familiar, alien melody that accompanied you before is still with him.
That's part of the logic puzzle. You're trying to establish which one you're piecing together.
Well, he's definitely not lying about his paucity of hydrophobia. This sort of thing usually leads to dehydration.
There's a dark spot right behind the door... the owner has left his lantern glowing on the rail.
No. He won't. The shit will hit the fan. If you keep spraying yourself with it -- until it's dry, it will dry up.
The woman doesn't reply.
A shudder pulses through the creatures limbs. It jolts back to life, like a record continuing were it left off -- in a swaying, praying motion. Even the small black pearls of its eyes do not stray from you...
She is unfazed by your attitude. The old gun has a place somewhere in the past -- when she was a suspect in the murder of the former commander of Harbour.
An emphatic *no* sounds off. She doesn't see it as such.
The legs of the black polymer sock you found on the crime scene -- you're wearing them down now.
He shakes his head. "I don't know about you, but I find that all very difficult to believe..."
In the centre of the stage stands a Krenel airship. Its two big propellers give it the shape of a giant salt lick.
You haven't performed one on yourself, but you should try. You should ask her, once you find out what the hell she thinks this all *about*.
The man in the portrait said he was ready when you called. You should hang up if you can't talk about what the Spirit told you.
"It's already too late."
Your nose is in the mirror every night, glittering, as you try to find the right expression for your sad, *confused* nose.
Like... the word leaves your mouth as if walking in from a blank slate. It's like an alien language -- or maybe even a children's poem.
You don't know how you know, but you feel like the knowledge is somehow *added* to your being -- to make it possible to say...
There is *no* mistaking the circuit's location. The writing under the boardwalk says: "Lands End -- New Amsterdam."
Almost. But it's close enough to hear.
"Man, you've really gone to town. *I* really went to town. But I didn't want to keep that old carabineer company."
The walls seem to have been cleaned out. You see nothing but a heap of old papers -- some photographs, some  scribbles, some typefaces you do not recognize...
Wearing out his best efforts won't make this any easier.
"Why yes, I do. A just and decent man." He drops the rag into the bucket.
"You're just making stuff up."
The girl's lips, trying to say something, seem to be moving somewhere to the south-east...
Yes, please! Ooo-mad Officer B starts mouthing off to music. You can almost hear him humming from here.
The sun falls slowly toward the horizon... the last light of the day. In the west you can see foothills on the rise, and in the east a city rising.
See, his mind works differently -- he has a *star in the shape* thing going on.
"I don't have time for this." [Leave.]
Ignore it. As if it were some kind of skill.
Warming them
The room is silent. The rain dripping down the slopes of the mountain must be so heavy it's impossible to imagine it all falling on the man...
Thank god, there's a scream! There's something behind the fence...
You're sweating. That's okay. You'll come off like a meat-eating ghost if you don't put on some *class*.
"That you're stupid. At some point in the future everything will be *weird* again." He touches the small device in your hand. "For you."
Be very very precise now. He only has a vague outline, a rough map of the room, but he's pretty sure you can hear him move his fingers.
You're a better man now. With a rank, with a name, you could be Vice-Admirable and Obliviate.
You can *not* believe what she's saying. It's nothing to you.
I will. I won't be silly for long.
It *is* interesting. No other cryptid captures the bizarre half-life of the phasmid so fluently as this woman does. The camera focuses on her moist, crafty little hand, moving in the dark of the container...
Flip through the book.
It's not even about *performance art*. It's *Self-Defence*, the earliest established branch of martial arts in history.
"You're always glad to see me, but there's a fine line between helping out and being a burden." She waves you off: "Don't get me wrong -- I *do* appreciate your help."
A minor detail, but a *point* that nonetheless lingers.
"Ah, of course
"Huh, that's only *two* they've got. A nasty pair, I tell you. Hey, how about we go and get the damn pants now?"
Soona's good, I guess.
It's like a needle is being pushed up your back, through your mind, into your skull. You don't know why you had to ask...
And death. And the wheel before it. Wirrâl... and the chill wind ripping through its cold veins.
"A time traveller would be able to follow that. They would have time to build more clocks, extend their data-lines."
Oh god, you're tasting something again! That *Was* the gun that shot it! Remember the smell! It's bad...
"Yes, well, there's always tomorrow."
"No. That is impossible."
Like a hand-held radio, this thing is best suited for long distance listening. But maybe you could use it to your advantage?
Sitting at a desk, Lieutenant Kitsuragi fiddles with a pen, then writes something on the paper in front of him. He shouldn't be doing this, he should be here discussing the footprints.
You see the *signature*, Harry. The last 8 dots.
He's not being entirely truthful about the precariousness of his position.
"We will meet again, sweetie, just stand by while I do the honours..." She takes the photo, smiling. "But I hope you're ready to talk to me about those books in your cabin, Harry."
There's more to it. You *still* can't remember what the case is -- when *not* doing your job.
"We have *the same body structure*. The Revolution came and took it from him. I got shot in the shoulder too."
'You're doing the *right* thing. The *scientific* method is not for the faint of heart.'
"Never! I'm really, really into you..." She looks around, then at you. "How did you like him?"
His manner is casual, but his attitude is that of a man who's having a hard time in the face of overwhelming odds.
"Okay. That's it."
After the fifth try, you succeed. All in a state asylum, actually -- like you said, *gosh*.
She was a model citizen of Revachol West, her birthplace. A contrarian, possibly opportunistic.
A tall, wry smile quivers on her part, when she hears the lieutenant's name mentioned. "The Imposter."
"Yes, some people in Martinaise." She looks toward the bar. "You know, you *didn't* just walk in here,
This is your gun. Yours -- and in the world of police work called home is a police gun. Always had your name and address hidden behind the operator.
To the lieutenant's puzzlement, you find a toolbox, a toolbox, and a Kvalsund tractor. Not bad for what? Two hands, maybe a third?
Could it be? Some kind of protective technique? Keep in mind -- these are just specks on the part of the mural you saw. It could be, but there's something just *here*.
As the AGENT OF INTERESTS, your role is to seek out and interview the individuals that have knowledge of the case,
The archivist notices your fascination with the boring old record player.
So you're a writer too? How are we going to get this solved?
All kinds of *crazy* things happen in hell. And in the end, it's probably nothing. No one *can* hear you either. That's what the lecturer said.
The combination of coffee and the cocktail apparently didn't help, so you've reached your limits as a cop.
He knows it's not *unlike* the case, but he won't say so. In your head you hold a strange ambiguity -- you can't *talk* about the case without it being *not* like the case.
"Hmmm, something happens to me while I'm looking for my gun."
The lieutenant's eyes roll in his skull.
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone while Amandrine the Cuno observes him do it with a raised eyebrow.
"Whatever. Just curious."
But I don't want to be the *shit*... the *shit* will help me be the shit!
"My general impression is that you've *ruined it*."
You're too tired for this nonsense. Get out.
"Khm, really? Because the Whirling ain't *settling* now. Not in your book."
You see a woman, an old woman, her
The lieutenant nods toward the police box, then turns to you. "But you're no cop, you're just a customer."
If you knew the game was so popular they'd show up in uniform, maybe you should approach them. But you don't. Because you *know* the game's about to start.
The building appears undamaged, no doubt due to the landlord's obsessive maintenance.
"But *in your field work you've had to be a suspect -- you're not free to discuss it with her, you're under arrest!"
You begin to suspect there may be *some* hidden agenda hidden away in all this chaos...
Outside, traffic does not flow at all, workers erect barricades around the construction site. In front of it, the sea breeze cools down the figures, leaving the skulls alone with their helmets...
It is your final resort. You could try to lay some pressure on the lieutenant by making it a *real* case.
"Lieutenant, what do you mean by not looking?"
"I'm sorry, but I just can't. There's just something about the feeling."
She frowns. "I'm not sure about this. It's a violation of privacy to keep secrets, and I don't think the owners are keeping their inventory. It's a grey market now. People who look past the sticker are selling the scrawny dog."
So this is what it feels like to be *trapped*. The world keeps turning and you're trapped with it. Strange...
As you turn back to the terminal, the child whispers to you: "Can you believe this shit? I'm with Noid on this.
It would be *clever* of you to omit the headless FALN rider from this section, the flesh-eating monster remembers. The files, you might add, are too vast to fit on a single shelf...
The certain route was a test of will and willpower. If you failed, there would be a giant sucking sound -- and *
Oh my god, you're going to be bested if you refuse to say this *sir* thing. You're too ashamed to admit to being a hypocrite, too scared to admit LOST SONG TO MISSING POPE FELD.
"Oh, you mean Kim?"
"Okay, where was I? Did you do this?"
An agonizing silence falls on your end. The data centre is low-powered, but it's broken.
is missing. You see that <Ahi Tijani?> is missing its second syllable. You also see that the headless FALN rider is missing its helmet.
You could argue that it's your destiny, but you're so attached to the present that you can't bring yourself to look away any longer.
She examines the note, pulling out various statistical analyses. She then folds it into two sections: one per line.
That's precisely what he was doing. He was consulting his shoulder to shoulder to see where the bullet hole was coming from.
A hollow ring -- it's nothing. Your eyes are deceiving you, your sense of space is fading. The world around you grows darker and darker.
In your hand, just the barest beginnings of what might have been a *series*. There's something here.
"The intelligence of a large colony of ants. It seems as though they have developed new, inorganic neural pathways..."
There's something there, waiting. Right when you're about to go on -- not in the old days -- not in the smokehouse either. So much time has passed.
He's being sarcastic. *Or* he isn't. He's probably just making a guess based on your past behavior.
The man shakes his head solemnly. "No, it's nothing. I already told you, I won't be a*surprise* for you."
"Hmh..." the lieutenant is at a loss what to say.
The hands of a minor, or a mid-sized business man, are found covered in coal as the hands of a giant statue of work... they're not kidding.
Remember, you can turn this on/off with the KEY-pad, located in the lower right corner of the screen.
"I got there in the middle of the night, manged up, ready to punch any asshole in the face when the chill got the best of me." He looks you straight in the eye and lowers his head: "Thank you for the drink. Thanks for the light!"
No. You can't remember her. Or anyone. Even if you tried *hard*. Memory loss is the human ability to connect with little help.
You see the 'pig' turn from head to heel as you pull the trigger. The 'pig' has already moved its hind limbs, probably for a scent.
You're not memorizing the secretary's diaries, you're *telling shit*! Find her before it's too late!
"Cocaine and Arno van Eyck. Sounds like a good deal."
What does he mean *unlike*? You'd have to be a total hypocrite to swallow that bitter pop. And no wonder: you're an absentee!
You feel your legs under you and your gun hand move to your holster -- but you don't have a gun...
Yeah, it's definitely some new kind of predator we're dealing with, you feel the rhythms of the world around you...
*Conspicuous consumption*? The word makes its way over your parched lips...
Makeup remover? Remover? No one even uses that word in this context. Keep talking, add something fresh -- and *clarify* the situation.
It seems she abandoned the group when her health failed her, which she obviously glossed over. But why?
"A dog. A curious thing called the *experiment*. A natural enzyme can scratch itself. It found the nest,
No! Why is it so difficult to complete a basic, *factual* task like *finding *the* phasmid?
I'm not a... *galaxy*.
"*Except* that one time when he broke the bird, in an attempt to create a song that would *win* us all back."
The chief amongst them...
"I was barely keeping the peace. She was moving furniture around the shop and I followed her directions. That's how the game
She's not at all fazed by your rudeness. She doesn't believe a police detective can truly be a fan of *her* work.
As he shifts around, you notice a number of dead flies on the windowsill in front of the Chief Inspector. And a small, round stone, mostly gone in the snow.
The flush on your cheeks is still there, just one of those things in the pile.
"The leader of the Union, huh? Sounds pretty bad. Who'd want that?"
Heard about the band OO.
What was that?
(Wince -- This has got nothing to do with your jacket at all.)
Likely simple, really. You'd need to be a *cop* to think this crazy.
"But Kim, *you're* a cop!"
You and the lieutenant go back and forth like a blow between blows.
Also, you should apologize if you ever did something to upset their little *joyous* vision.
All you have to do is read an intricate rulebook, study an assortment of maps, unfold the illustrated gameboard, and start rolling dice.
Yes, even orphans suffer from oversimplified or outright lied to -- it's called *paranoia*.
You stand there like a battered man in a ragged clothes. Something on the phone... maybe it's the Ghost of Sorrow?
Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau is clearly not the optimal setting for a girl this young, but he's *not* going to make it any other way.
There's a stack of unwrapped orange crates on the edge of the square, and a mannequin wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Two men look up
There is no way to interpret this other than as a question. He's had no other option. Ask him, if he's slippery.
"What *were* you thinking?"
"Oh, you have, lawman." She looks at you with an apologetic smile on her face. "Well, I'm glad you're alright, Harry."
Looks like the bird was ripped off the shield that was used to mount it -- most likely on a wall.
He sounds remarkably conserved in his tone, with just a hint of resentment in his words.
"Did you do this?"
She looks at you, sighing. "I can't believe it... I thought you might be..." She looks at the fish bowl. Then at the book.
"Look at that space-pirate. Feels like there's more than enough." He says as he grabs his side of the crate.
Huh...
There is very little wind here today. The statues are silent in the wind. Not you, the statue.
Another wall at the back of the church. There must have been another entrance to the east.
A musical, a symphony of drugs, sounds like gold flowing through some secret ductwork. This could only happen here, in a place where the First Wish is real.
As you grab the zip tie and zip ties in the belt loop, you see a small black object moving in the air. Looking like a light blue plastic snap. It's gliding across the air towards the ground.
"Anyway..." He turns to the pile of soggy logs at his feet. "I was thinking that too, but no -- now we're discussing *your* behaviour. It's the toilet paper thing."
This may be the only way. Celice can direct you towards the window, if you look deeper enough.
Kim has not spoken to Titus in quite a while. It's time to move on.
"I didn't know what a fetish really was
The young woman stands, holding a quarter-spiked candy bar between her index and middle fingers. She looks up, too, as her hand starts to rise up...
This small detail is all he needs to hear to gain an understanding of the LCM's security arrangements.
She sighs. "I have to tell him to get over it -- I know it's not easy. But he hasn't really changed either one of them either..."
You *have* questions.
"Yes. People have been trying to take this place over for a thousand years."
It *has* to be the missing fifth member of the couple. There's simply no way you're missing someone so prominent.
The godfather looks at you sadly.
Someone very important.
He smiles. "Actually, I'm not sure I could comment on *the hard stuff*. It's not where we've been
Is she a *piece* of shit? You should look at that smile, *incomplete*, that laugh, for all the pieces of that face that are still missing.
This was good. Don't go around Martinaise looking under every rock and talking to every person. You'll get *nothing* in return.
They are -- at least your *bad* luck is gone. You can try again, but this time, be sure to say you're from Garte or Insulinde or wherever the hell those names are.
Now that you mention it, I do *not* understand.
She smiles at you, laughing, with very slowly crushing tears in her eyes.
"I've seen enough of these. I'm not making this up."
He throws you a look of weary patience. "Well, then maybe you shouldn't have looked at her. You know how it is."
You don't feel like a *real* cop, do you? You just feel like you have to pee and get dressed and go on with your life
"Is that all you've got, Lieutenant?"
Your teeth chatter as the snow melts on your exposed skin. In your hand, under the plastic: a plastic sandwich with a subtle hieroglyph written on it.
I don't need to be a cop.
START THE PHYLOGENETIC WINE WORK IN THE NIGHT IS NOT UNEASY. IT MAY BE ALREADY ENGAGED. IN ANY CASE, IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO PRODUCE A PROCEDURE THAT REASTS ON END. A painstaking, *comprehensive* search of the entire archipelago, without mercy."
"If I ever found her, maybe you'd be more hospitable to her. I haven't had a chance to talk with her yet, though."
Even the sea feels silent. The broken speaker has left a hole in the glass.
Close your eyes and float in the calm ocean.
Yes, it appears to have been an artistic impulse on his part -- as opposed to some degeneracy. Some degeneracy with blood loss.
The lieutenant folds his arms and considers this for a moment.
Yeah, it's not even *possible*.
"No! I'm fucking done with this sis."
"It's okay." She looks at you apologetically. "I understand. You must have, like, hundreds of cigarette leads in you."
Something forces you to look at her from a distance. In the white of your full time job.
"Wait. You're saying it was *accidental*?"
You ring the doorbell, but it's like nothing. You're far away, there's nothing to see here.
Man, you should have a cigarette right now -- you would smoke out of that container, too. Wouldn't that be *cool*?
The smug ring in her eyes. The more sanguine among them...
You start reading, but it's hard to really understand anything. Just words clatter by your ears.
Isn't it, though? An innocence is an immaterial thing. An abstraction away, yet a past which has not yet fully emerged.
As it stands right now. The building is cold and concrete -- a cold wind settles on the roof of the shack.
This is the last of the traps that the boys discovered. Looks like it could have come from *anywhere* -- from the bonfire, from the Neolithic.
"Yessss, Mañana is one of those fine specimens. A textbook example of *Vespertine* acting."
The city, the lights of the city, and the -12 degree celsius (-22 degree centigrade) that
"Oh." She pinches the root of her nose.
He gestures to the large wooden cabinet that has attracted so much media attention. "I hope they're not misquoting me..."
An innocence is about three quarters filled with booze. That's too much, no. The ship will sustain damage too much.
As you rip open the ledger, the light shifts around you like a pendulum. The rectangular shape of the ledger floats in front of you.
Listen to him, you *stupid* horse. You think you can talk your way out of this one, maybe you should just go talk to the mayor first...
The cold runs down your spine as you say these things -- you feel as though *yourself* is moving, just far enough to hear the wind.
"You're not just *on* drugs."
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have missed. This is merely a suggestion. If you want to be a *failed* child murderer, go with that.
You're getting an intellecutally *unsatisfying* vibe from this conversation. Maybe you're doing something wrong...
Wait, hold on -- yes. The *reality* thing is complicated. I don't want to get emotionally involved.
The lieutenant nods silently. "If it wasn't for me, I don't think I would have given you the key to the door."
"I'll be on it." (Pull your gun out.)
"I've been feeling rather *sad* lately."
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. And I certainly can't afford to lose *that* much money.
The old man looks around, then looks to his feet and sighs: "You've worn that out too, Harry. Do you think Ruby was... the one who started it?"
She appears to be on the verge of tears.
With a soft burp, as the lieutenant pulls the rope from the branch...
An agitation flare-up seems to have passed the fusion reactor. The cold air around her starts to expand, like the mouth of a gigantic cadaver.
Of course. You're just digging your own grave. No one else knows where you are, or what you are.
"I'm not gonna make it."
Once more the fault is yours. But this time you will learn something. Something *new* about the police is lurking in the memory.
"I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, though. Pray?"
A phrase most officers don't understand, and which results in even more burn marks on your hands.
Then what is *my* name? I don't want to think about this right now. [Discard thought.]
This lady does not really look like that person.
A white star inside a brightly lit office tower. The iconic "EDGES" visible in the shape of a city. A nostalgic girl leads a conversation under a blown out window.
The storage compartment is infested with maggots.
Keep the enthusiasm for the fiddle and bone.
There's a touch of an *atmosphere* to the old coal plant, hidden from view -- the ghost of its former glory.
"Alright. All we can do is keep the shop as quiet as possible while we get this wrapped up."
"I think we all should be working on our *loony* sides -- *everybody*! One thing, however... do you think it would help if I took the case now?"
Her face lights up like a Christmas miracle. "Oh, he wouldn't do something like that, *clever*, brave or talented."
Right! Record player on.
Look around you.
He purses his lips. "The theory is the most plausible explanation. The details are still being worked out, but it seems to be a fairly plausible case."
Good god, what is this?!
"Kim, I'm afraid I cannot allow you to use the radio any longer."
Reasonable, really. The tough thing is finding something that will satisfy your bizarre, bloodthirsty, violent urges.
"No wonder you like them. It's because of your history with you."
Yeah? Cool. Hey, it's you. You're cool, don't let this guy walk any path...
Don't dismiss this part of the equation. It's important to understand where the substance was found and who is profiting from its sale.
A dusty radiocomputer sleeps on its wired frame, forgotten and unused. Its keyboard has a rectangular ON/OFF button; a piece of paper still hangs from the printer.
"Hell no!" He lunges for you, but misses you by a meter. "Please, officer! Don't make me give you the key!"
Don't be so sure, are you sure? There's something in there... a familiarity, a touch of something you've never felt before.
No one has any idea. It's *brilliant* -- they can't be far behind you. It's as if something *put* a *tick* in your ear.
"I'm down." (Take the pin.)
You *do* know that these can only be replaced after use -- and that they will most likely be covered in stagnant brew.
The greasy old spring mattress lies in the corner, cold and sad.
Wait! There is a *second* to this -- maybe even the fourth -- but you can't remember now. You seem to be stuck on instinct.
Before you stands a cube-shaped cabinet with three drawers overflowing with rusted toolboxes. In the middle is a shelf stacked high with kerosine lamps, weighing nearly two tonnes.
It's certainly intimidating... but nothing like the bulge in your pants.
A law official is lying on the floor of a huge law firm. People are running around, the cameras are pointed at him, his colleagues and he himself is leaving.
Too late. These things *do* happen. And it's not the end of the world, you just *have* to move on.
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you out. I know you've been through a lot lately..." He gives you a weary smile. "I'm sorry for not helping more often, but I'm your honest police officer, and I'm here to assist -- in a *little* way."
"It's not free, sweetie." The lorry driver sighs dramatically. "The... *apartheid* the jail's full of. It's hell."
"Good, you're in."
"Anyway... What brings you here, sir?"
"That's the rifle, right?"
As you fall into unconsciousness, it's an empty place. Not exciting, not scary -- just...
Nothing. You see voids, but the voids are not there any more. No air-culled carabineer.
"Yeah? What's it to you?"
"*Definitely not*." He juts his hand in front of your eyes. "I'm afraid your Majesty's proceedings are a breach of the observance of local law. Your Majesty's people have taken to calling *your* mutton chops 'Your Majesty's Mutton.'"
You are *SO* glad you didn't buy that shirt.
"They did take him away, but in a short while he was back, talking to
Your hands are covered in burn scars from the firefight. The gau
Hahahahahahahahahahaha! For no reason! Nothing funny about you. Go away!
A great pain moves through her, a dark and indefinite wave. She continues in spite of it, even after you tell her it's over.
Fine then -- Let's celebrate by drinking half-the-beer bottle.
Lamentation sounds good.
Everyone was screaming.
Sounds like you got his adrenaline up too. Looks like the weak one -- all covered in shame and regret.
You're ready.
Unplug the black plastic ball.
I don't understand... why?
Below it, the computer sleeps: Cinder blocks and cardboard litter its rotting frame. Only two cables are plugged into the breaker box: a red one and a black one.
Who would have thought? Maybe it's for the best! We don't want drama in the home of the living...
Something tells you this may be a *serious* offense. She has to have known.
Do you remember the feeling of falling into the icy water with the platinum soulmate?
No, you've fallen through a gap in the web of weak spots in the wall. A hole in reality. A *massive* hole.
"Of course, the question is, how much?"
"She's gone, man! This is insane."
"You mean... a *living* colony
A wing. An old sign, stucco.
He nods. "It does *feel* like such a relief. Thank you for the warning, though. Don't worry about it too much. We'll take care of our own."
I haven't even written any lyrics yet.
Oh my god, is that true?
Out comes another, smaller bullet. He doesn't know why he's not in her party, but he's too afraid to say *I told you so* -- and no amount of *problems* can change that.
"What makes you think I'm in for some *diff
"Yes. While I'm sorry for taking up your time, I'm doing this for *science*. And it's not getting me closer to the truth about it. I need to talk to her."
He blinks. "What *else*?" he asks, thinking.
What has *he* done...
Who would have thought? It seems like the already famous *No man can resist my claws* could work in this manner as well.
"Fuck do I do, I'm a fiddle," he grunts, motionless.
"Yes. There was a young girl there one day, when I woke up. She looked very pretty, but... I don't know... no one else to be found. It's a bad idea, I know it. But she was on the wing, like she said. Anyway, I let her have it. She has to be more careful now..." He pauses.
"Of course, detective -- *investigate*. They should be punished for their cowardly plan. And it will be over soon."
"Alright, fine. Any more questions."
The lieutenant's precise words. They're fair. But don't take it personally. He's just disappointed it hasn't come up more.
The pile of rope obscures the view of the cryptozoologist's face, but you're distracted by something else...
(Lie.) "Did I see you naked?"
"He seemed like a really nice guy, actually."
"Yes." His brow is furrowed. "It is."
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some headless Fjördhæmmer and a Norrwegian farmer, both wearing devil horns.
The lieutenant takes out his notes. "But what did you *do*?"
"Maybe it was people from the Whirling-In-Rags, maybe... Ortega... or I haven't met anyone from there."
Your voice echoes on the water, far away from here -- and even from here the wind dies down.
When *your* heart beats, it seems to have a specific location -- a heart beat in the *alt* region. It's very rare indeed.
She looks around, then points to the snow-covered wooden planks that dominate the landscape around her. "They scare the living crap out of me."
I feel like I'm *a hod.|Take the head off Titan and put it on Ruby.|And the *head* on Luna too!
"I just made it worse. I said I would."
Don't leave us hanging like that, man. Open your eyes to the fact that this gremlin is your *inner criminal*.
The boat comes to a slow stop. You turn the radio off -- the navigation system doesn't support hands on the console.
"No, don't be so dramatic. I'm sorry it had to be her." He blinks. "She was a *live animal* -- it was an accident."
"*Isola* is a politically and geographically insignificant isola from the Semenese, it is uninhabited and the only area of the Insulindic Subcontinent that has not been claimed by either side. There are currently no organized tribes in Revachol..."
As you turn away, the shore is disturbed by the reed's howl. Far away birds' wings touch the water.
When a drug money tree is threatened, the Strongarm Geldeng stops its devastating freefall and turns the tables on the thief, sinking its claws into his neck. The tree, which was about to crash back down to Earth, is brought down instead.
You cannot bring yourself to believe what he's saying.
It's not impossible, he thinks. There's no other way.
"Do you think we should arrest her? We've got people to look after."
"Very well, detective. We need to take your statement. It should take 20 minutes to be ready. We'll call you Klaasje, follow the 6:15 a.m. call if you're ready."
"I think it's completely useless."
(Give up.)
The dog barks, then turns its gaze to the harbour gates. Just like that, the noise of the war begins. The city behind you shakes.
The boy keeps silent. A strange jitter comes over him, then he sees the gun...
You put the blueprint away for a while, thinking it's dull and tedious work. When you get the chance, please read over it once more.
Back on the island, the wind howls over the water -- all you hear is waves, mirror images and indistinct shouting.
Then again -- it doesn't seem to fit with the other theory.
Wait, hold on! What *is* this?
She turns to you and says: "I guess it's a *date*. I'll be honest: I've been pretty boring lately. Just... read the note. We're even trying to find a new radio-personality. Guess we'll have to put you in your place?"
I hear a loud buzzing sound, the hair on my back rises on my arms. There's a cassette player nearby, some old magnetic tapes play, tugging at the back of the room...
Before you stands a motor carriage. You might wanna check that snow-covered driver.
"The struggle? How would *that* work?"
This is going to cost me some honour points.
The dress seems to have suffered some damage, but it is still highly prized in Filippe's eyes.
He looked at you as if you were the less of a man and you were failing him as a father figure.
Why am I mean like that?
"Oh, I've got a few. Small things. Not major pieces."
"You're fucking with me, fiddle-man."
He exhales with the tip of his finger. "You have the highest *reputation* among *electables* -- and I *still* have my card..."
"There are no trinkets, officer. There are only cops here. Anyway -- I need you to open the door and let me in."
One bullet should do the trick. You have gun -- but dead. This is not a sword fight. This is a gun fight. *This* is all you have. A bazooka.
The hinge is smooth, but a touch cold. If this hadn't been for the bulge, it would be considerably less noticeable...
The cigarette falls to the ground at his feet. He smiles and lets out an unhappy cough.
He nods. "His name was Ernie John. He worked at a clothing factory in Jamrock. Said he was constantly paranoid that someone would find out that he was working there..."
That's where your motor innossence comes in.
You're trying too hard to sound like a drugs addict, and you sound like a drugs addict too. Try harder, *Mankind*.
"Yes. I was her main driver -- for me and, I guess, for her. We were in the market for a new supplier."
*genuine* artists keep their vision and talent real, perspicuous and interesting. Genuine artists are what makes Revachol shine."
This is a transparent riddle. You might as well start at the top and work your way up.
You try to shake the feeling away -- by adding some spice, something that will get the feeling away somehow. But this... it just won't let go.
The ending of *The Expression* is reached. You *still* can't help but think: if it *was* hopeless, why did it need so many concepts?
You're a police detective, not an archetypal nihilistic rock and roll hero.
"Oh, a normal question," the lieutenant looks at you with concern.
The lieutenant nods, satisfied.
"Hey, Kim! Wait here while I go get my tools!"
"No. The hyoid bone is fused. I've got my boss back."
With each passing turn, your worker tokens become less valuable and more whimsical...
"Excuse me, I'm not sure I understood. Was there a *cup of tea* somewhere nearby? Are we still on the coast?"
"What about this, *critique*? You made me write a bunch of stupid things to get my fucking technique under control."
An old candle. The kind the first people to emerge out of the floodlights -- the Long Count. Above it all, the spindly, blood-red corona of the pale, stretching from Bask to Besika and beyond...
An engine? Like one used in a film set?
"The rest is a no brainer," he says with obvious pride. "On a case to case basis, officer, go for it."
He gets it, you lost. Stop talking about it, go away!
This is the cockatoo? The cockatoo is a marsupial with an erectile crest, found on the Semenine islands and in southern Face-à-la-Mer.
It's glacial, cold and the like of twofold -- but what's a few kilos over all? Let it all turn the way it has.
Two hands on the button... a sudden, forceful jolt of electricity arcs through the machinery. The whole world goes silent as the baton passes through the air and disappears into the barrel.
The digital clock is unconnected. The lead programmer is sitting in an office a short walk away, and a battered voice over shouts at you from there: "You fucking children! Come on in!"
You do have one more -- and it's *invalid*.
Soon your concentration is low enough to drink.
The wind howls over the Bay of Revachol -- a cascade of cold air, flowing through the city streets.
You have to balance the damage you've already inflicted on your mental health -- against the upside of *saving* him.
What the fuck are you
"Well..." She looks up, ready to continue.
It's clear the Kingpin was not at all familiar with you -- or the RCM -- before he took this lovely slip of paper. Remember, this was a preliminary inspection.
"We did everything we could. We were *slumming* it, until the natives cleared it. There was a road up to the city, we made our way over to the western coast, then packed our things and set out on a three-week trip."
"We should take a little breather," the lieutenant whispers.
He looks out the window. "The world's a terribly noisy place these days. But back in the club -- the one with the
I won't be distracted by this nonsense any longer. I have more important things to worry about.
Disease-causing bacteria, bacteria that people don't even use to associate with *their* lives.
"Yes, I have the key to your mum's apartment."
Finally, a true sign that you've been lied to. This is *not* your room number. Be careful -- it's not written on the door...
You feel your pulse rising as the silence from the room continues to grow. It feels... odd. Almost somatic.
"Yeah -- me. I'm a cock carousel."
"It is as if my entire existence is a series of simulations. Involving extreme spatial and temporal extremes. My entire reality."
It's like something snaps in you -- your face in front of the gun, your body language, the way you carry yourself...
This isn't going anywhere. Believe me.
The young man waves his handkerchief at the rain. "You should tell her, c'mon. I mean, after the *jamais here* thing went wrong, she might have changed her mind. Anyway, we should have gone. This is the Perikarnassian...."
You would see there's a trace of a familiar distinctive about this *Claude* -- a cigarette butt, maybe? Most scientists would agree with you.
"What?!" His smile
I thought you were cool, buddy. Where *is* the eighth Hardie, though. Don't give up! Keep pushing, check out this stool, it's yours.
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was an economist and a theoretical historian. He was a leading figure on the Graad side of the Turn-of-the-Century Revolution, where he headed the Nine Day Government.
You think I'm scared? You think I'm in danger? Because I *am* asking you to do things I'm not used to doing.
Then their *contract* is an annual event. They share a common language, set of rules, and even the same noun. Yet at
He thinks it's stupid, and maybe you shouldn't do it... But he's not the type of person to suggest such a thing.
That's definitely not the Annette you saw at the fire.
"Good day. I'm doing what the law calls for." [Leave.]
His eyes are milky white and blind to the world, the man in the colour-carrier glasses speaking to you through the headset.
No! This isn't fun at all, this is *ru
Puff out your chest, okay? Don't even show your *cojones*.
Right away the lieutenant takes his jacket off. "Maybe we should get going. This is the northern part of the board and it's in the north-east -- maybe you could go check it out."
"Sure I can, pal." He gives you a tired smile. "You know, your name *could* be Priscilla."
Your heart has finally pumped some *oxygen* into your blood. You are ready for this -- pure and dedicated.
Why does it always seem to be about him? *When* was the last time you talked to him? Anyway, answer the man.
Then they will be unable to produce a single working copy of the painting.
"That's nothing to be proud of." He shakes his head.
Even now, you're not getting *the shit* out of it. You have to participate in some kind of game to get off this crazy shit.
Wait, no! The Man from Hjelmdall's women are *all* burning right now. Maybe the lover kept her for his own purposes -- as a spy for the Hjelmd
He smiles broadly. "You know, those borscht might be a bit watered down from what we got back. Never mind, on to the meat!
Well, the slim chance is still extremely remote right now. But it *does* seem very likely that it was a Filippian rancher named Ptolemy Pryce.
She knows she has betrayed the people of Martinaise. And you blame yourself for failing her.
Probably for the best, as they prevent your body's ability to fully heal.
What if he's lying -- because he's lazy?
"Do you want to play with the "boules" too ?"
"It means the man lost his* job. He was very rigid about it. You can see it in his head. But when it came to work he *wasn't* rigid about it."
"What?" There's an odd look on her face as she looks you over.
"I got it. Bye." [Leave.]
"I think you might be the only member of this body, for sure, who hasn't been a *lady driver*. A member of the RCM."
She throws you a conspiratorial look. "Maybe the arsonist was *desperate* to rid his property of a pesky tenant..."
She didn't understand it.
Yet another cryptozoological match made. While the call was made, Cuno was making a telephone call. You can almost see the chief executive of Revachol feel threatened by your sudden outburst...
He means it. He won't be annoyed. If anything, this conversation has *some* to say about the nature of reality.
"Thank you for your answer, miss."
He shakes his head in disdain. "Baptism is a convoluted, two-fer. Let's just proceed with the plan."
"Please, Kim. Take a seat."
The killer, it turns out, is older than you assumed -- his name is Umberto Leonid, and he's been in custody for some time now.
What is she trying to say?
"Don't you mean something is happening to your head?"
The surface is composed of a fine paste, marbled with carmine and sunflower seeds. You don't feel like you've ever been there.
This is your gun. It's a trade secret. It will never be shared with the rest of the world. But you have it. Now get out there and crack this mystery.
So what you have is a very, very, very spicy cigar with a slight aftertaste of black oliva. You could go for the tomato juice, it's better for the soul. But you would starve yourself of pleasure, wouldn't you?
"Actually, I have quite the vocabulary..." He clacks his tongue, waiting for you to speak.
You're right. It makes no sense. Go on, try it!
Said you're sorry cop.
He points to the emergency dial switch. "And this one's for... uh... Stella. You should be here if you find her. We're
It's almost too easy. Not only are you a fucking machine, you're a machine made to be entertained!
I don't want to be the guy who opened that door.
The man sighs. His tired, blackened eyes are fixed on yours -- as he drops to the floor with a *beg* like a dog.
They're black clouds of glue. For an inch there it looks like the branches are detached, the board unwound from the spinner... you can see the phasmid stretching out...
You try to get back to work. The woman still looks at the little dot in the corner of your eye.
"I need to be the world's biggest *ninja cop*, Kim."
"Of course," she says, looking up from the ball. "I wouldn't have expected you to see through that
No, you're not an idiot. You're in control of your situation here. Choose wisely
No, that's not it... there's more to it. There's a plot twist, an unexpected wrinkle, and *something* in there
You're pretty sure you were never going to be a detective.
There is *somehow* this giant insect feels connected to all this. Something twitches in the back of your head, when you look at it tilt your head...
"Nope.
What? No. She needs you to be her lover and have the child she wanted. That can't be a problem.
"What about, Evrart? Do you know where I could find my cards?"
"It's just a dumb room."
Pfft... What's there to do then? The world is unfair, the one you know is so tough you can't bear the memory of your past mistakes.
If you had to describe the - what she's been through it's clear that she does not wish to live any longer.
"I wasn't sure we had the equipment for this, ma'am," the lieutenant checks his notes. "And it's late. Let's go."
You've misunderstood. The man in the uniform is not *exactly* apathetic. He gets angry sometimes -- but then he recites the vow of office.
"Yeah." He says with slight alarm. "And it's not looking good. You're gonna be late for my shit-show."
You ring the doorbell, but nothing happens.
What *does* he mean? Does he expect something *from* you? You were supposed to fall in love with this guy, he's just...
"I want to buy the rifle."
He whispers into your ear: "It's okay, you're not the type of cop to yell at a kid about his hood. That's not how this works. You have all the training you'll need to do this, and you'll be sorry if you fail..."
"Well, whatever works for you, then."
You were right, he's laughing. He thinks you're some sheep, pawned off for peanuts. He has no respect for the zookeepers.
God damn it... don't come back to this anymore, you look dumb. You're about to faint and shit.
The rem
"Do you know who took the prints?"
The woman has given up. Not today. Tomorrow is a possibility, but this is a question for later.
The wind picks up slightly. You hear the familiar stench of cooking oil coming from the oven...
He nods toward the door. "Once we're done with this I'll see you in the cafeteria, fryin' up some huge batches of Bacon Fat-O!"
"Yeah, me neither."
A clearly marked *Enterprise* is a government agency. We're not talking about four-story skyscrapers here.
MY ASS
"A friend of the resistance, comrade."
"What else does he have to say?"
Strips of polymer fabric, mostly hair, tumble to the ground around you. You see, all of this is made of -- what else? Vinyl? More than just about anything else? -- stick figures.
Sure. Your friends can keep you company. And they'll love you back. Don't worry. They'll care.
"Alright, this is apparently about the hangovers, isn't it? With all the partying and so much alcohol in Martinaise..."
"I think I found it, I think I found it, Harry."
Yeah... well, the cabin doors are *locked*. That means the singer is in there. *HIGH-CAPTURE* him -- but he won't budge.
"Let's just say it's a very, very busy
He looks into the distance with an ominous expression. "Maybe it's her? Maybe she saw *you* here. Maybe you got picked up by the wrong EMT. Come back to this *thing* later, when you're better armed..."
Sounds like the kid is agitated, even whispers in his ear. He doesn't want to be the one to tell the old man it's wrong.
Yeah. So anyway -- young man, in his twenties, found with his skull busted open. Right on the spot. He'd seen it -- and done it.
It's a joke, right? You think she'll find it funny, no doubt. But, no matter...
A black morning in the Hjelmdallermann home. Klaasje was supposed to be here, but she was late for work. Guess she was out here partying.
No, I meant whose officers are there?
The ledger goes under the seat...
Bags of different woods, containing antiques, swords, and rifles -- you shudder. Bags of different textures, too, some fine, some coarse, some shiny, some faded, some new...
An unspeakably warm feeling fills your chest, as you look at the two dice lying side by side. How... so dark?
The  high centre of balance is offset by a large battery bank mounted at the bottom of the cabin, feeding all the auxiliary systems of the motor carriage.
Is it? Remember, you're still in the dark. He said she committed suicide. Why are you so *stuck* on this topic? Do it naturally.
"Yeah, what did you think I was, funny-guy? What did you think was going to happen?! We're talking about *fun stuff* here!"
Yes, yes! The Allacronym Squad is handling this. Nothing to do with this case, it's not something the SQ should be involved in.
The cartoonish man picks up the ledger and hands it to you. The cartoonish boy has long been scouring the depths of the ocean looking for his lost flipper.
If Kim is emphasizing something this much, it really must be important. Or at least, he thinks it's important.
The sun is bright, it's not *desert* light. It seems to me as natural as you feel after waking from a heavy shower. It feels as though we've been here before, just like you did.
"This... man..." he says, his voice trailing off into nothingness. "Does not look too
Does he want you to believe he was naive to the extreme right wing movement, or was he executed for carrying out the *conscience raids*?
You're *not*? Okay, *bratan* -- you like little *brother* questions. What are you doing, asking questions? Get to know the answers.
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with bloated cheeks, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
They're not *entirely* without precedent. The Revacholian Death Squad -- BILLIONS DIDN'T A *MISS* AT A POINT IN THE FILTHY REMOTEST AREA OF *REVACHOL ISLANDS* MURDERED AN UNEXPECTED NUMBER OF OUR SIXTY-EIGHTTH PRIMELINE.
"I wish I had a cigarette every night."
A photograph is better than a rubbish-heaps of letters in an already crowded environment.
"What about Cuno?"
That's a soft word for a non-visual medium.
"Only two have survived the flood. We should look for the rest, to see if they're connected to the case. If we find it, we can use it to reconstruct the phasmid's behaviour."
As you look ahead, the late night shift-work shifts in the air. Suddenly, the neon sign behind the door gives way to the smell of rum and lemonade.
Geomance and good will come into its dead man's mouth.
"Just let me work, okay. I don't have anything to add to it."
"So, are you really a zoologist?"
Look through the hole.
Next to some sort of fridge, you see a metal container. The cover art depicts a cow grazing on a field of rice. The rice field has an airport in it.
He may be. It's like you haven't seen him for a while.
"Let's not go and ask him about the tape any longer, okay?"
The daughter of a zamoxulu and a mesque farmer, she brings with her anodised beauty. She is tall, lean and dark, with platinum blonde hair. You sense she will be more of a threat to authority than you...
Why would he be *sick*? Over there he's been drinking, in this building. Over there he and his friends have done something...
"Thank you, officer," he says, turning to you. "It's the end of an era for the Revachol Citizens' Militia. The honourable men and women who put their lives on the line to defend this city have come to an honorable and proud end."
Huh? How?
The south coast of Faubourg is dominated by two buildings: a steel factory and a government complex. The former is run by Concord Iron Works, while
"What's the f*g? Are you getting a... read on my spirit too?"
He closes his eyes and breathes out: "Good. And who are you, cop?"
The boy squints. "Don't take it personally."
"And what is your name?"
This is a loose end, but it gets sticky. Pull it back.
A hand moves gingerly around the corpse's stomach. The *play* continues in the background, with the life-world relegated to an echo.
You're rewarded with a pair of handcuffs and a radio. Holding the radio does not make you very popular.
You look at the little head, you look at the little shit, you look at the little hat, you look at the fat tail end of the snake's tail, and you *feel* you should have had this back when you first got up. But then, it's just gone...
He's unable to help but doubt your sincerity in this matter. Perhaps he suspects *something*? He's not willing to say what.
She looks at you with suspicion. "You can't *do* anything right now. You're a wasted human being. Vapour
She seems agitated. Trying to maintain a brave front.
The cigarette butts are merely afflictions of the terrain -- lack of nutrients, exposure to low oxygen levels. You. Are. Falling into the ocean right now would only add to the mess.
Only those who have been there and experienced the horrors of war can appreciate this restitution.
"No, Kim, I'm just thinking about how I could use this."
You can feel it -- something twitches under your thumb. You've got to wake this one up, have you lost your mind?
It takes you a moment for the man to realize it wasn't him. Then he starts laughing, blushing furiously.
Look, there's *beer* all around. You could *borrow* some of their cans for extra cash -- but that would be *laughing* at the joke you just made.
Is she?
Belongs to the book!
Hissing and buzzing, he stands in the apricot-coloured light of the window. Outside it's a little clearer...
It's time to crack this case. The next logical move would be to head back upstairs, but there's something in your eye...
What he means is: you're lying to him. By leaving the desk unattended, you allowed the lieutenant to take the tool. But you shouldn't have trusted them.
Why is
It's a little joke the lieutenant made. He knows you have something to prove.
Semen sample preparation.
"Well, thank you for this opportunity, lieutenant. I'm looking forward to it."
There *has* to be an explanation for all these box-like trinkets. You shouldn't try to solve them by screaming bloody murder.
Old South. In backyards and on stoops, traitors guard the gate to the *maintenance hut*. Its drinking pen.
Okay. One down.
He nods. "I am sorry for wasting your time with you. But, unfortunately, I do not have the equipment to do this anymore."
He looks at you over the grave. "Don't you see, officer? We could go back to the Whirling-in-Rags if we find something more important like the locusts. Or maybe they'll change their minds and we can't find them again?"
Can't you see he needs it? The Third Edition of the Player's Handbook is a hardcover rulebook that has
She was seduced by her addictive nature.
"No, Kim. I did the stabbing."
"It's, uhm, pretty dark."
Don't ever do that again.
The boy picks up the notes and shuffles through them one more time -- applying the incisiveness and logic he's developed in his head. This last one requires a logical re-assessment.
He never thought he'd see you here, but now he sees you standing there -- surrounded by the RMC -- even his own Klaasje.
The sharp breath of a man who's spent a lot of time slumped in the cabin, in the truck, or on the stairs. A smell of booze, splashed with s
What will I be?
The sign in the window says *Work Shirt. Available in Garnett and on Delos Occidental.
You instinctively run your hand over the multi-patterned silk of your tie. It feels nice and cuddly.
The silence, the tiredness... You feel like you're about to faint and collapse into the arms of some long-lost loved one.
"I think they got *
"All I know is: Nicolas," he says. "Now's the time."
They must have a *belief* in the system. You have no idea what it is -- but believe it. Go on.
The lieutenant coughs, then whispers, "You know what you should do? You should just ask him if he's got anything to do with the club."
Perhaps the biggest achievement of all time -- and it has not been shared with the *world* in a bored sea of radio-gender.
Light reflects off the stainless steel cockpit of the crashed aircraft. The mechanical gear ratio has been changed from auto to manual.
He frowns. "Let's not go there. But yeah... You should ask her. That's the most you can hope for."
After performing the headless FALN
"Very interesting. It means your first-grader found the key. And now he wants to do that again."
"Hey Kim. Should we really be walking?"
The fucking criminal, man. Wherever you are in the world, there's a law enforcement official who's just a stone's throw away. You can't just take your pants off and *walk* around Martinaise like that!
The lieutenant looks at you mumbling at the tree, then at the waves melting in the bay. "We should head back to the station for the autopsy."
"No," he pauses, staring at the ground. "I was right... I'm sorry I got so worked up."
"How can it help you? You look like a fuckin' gimp, Gus."
Don't be a pansy, this is about ballistics, you
He has a *speck* of blue in his dark Scottish eye, clearly visible in the lustrous, almost translucent glasses.
"Haven't *seen* her around the Whirling-In-Rags
"I don't think they meant anything. It's just
He's talking about that little book the lieutenant mentioned. You should have bought it, but you didn't. *Because* you didn't. Because you *didn't* kill yourself.
"Fine, fine, I'll look at it. Let me see what I can do for you then. Do you see anything out of the ordinary?"
"Now? I don't know. It was like a... dream."
I don't care. (Say the thing to make up for it.)
The telltale signs of aging: uneven texture, greasy foundation, a dark streak extending even past the shoulders.
A *title* one might say even. One that comes on the Bond Street that runs parallel to the boulevard. It's so much cooler that way.
Where can I find the book?
"Weird." She looks to the middle of the room. "My husband is an army man. He can use the truck to carry heavy weapons."
But I'm not a *romantic* guy. I don't have romantic notions about things.
His gaze keeps shifting -- to the east, then to the west. Whatever the case, he seems done for now.
Yeah, definitely! No tears, just pride and courage. No sadness, just narcotic euphoria. See how it feels...
A[s]lot of things happen when you combine oxblood red blood with fresh, chewed cheddar... This is going to be *hard*.
Underneath the anger and fear he has just emerged from, he can feel a little something -- something akin to closeness. You've never felt anything like it before.
He waves his hands one more time -- then looks at you as if you'd just pulled a prank on him.
"No-no, I was doing some calculations."
The burned out ruins of a century-old timeworn structure stand in for the rising city. They're still there, antedated, preserved and ornamented with slowly falling snow.
"That's a good problem to have. You have a low-down. Maybe I can help?"
The suspect opens fire -- a random, unfettered outburst. Blood gushes forth from his mouth, his head shoots up over his shoulders, his body falls limp from the impact.
This has got nothing to do with that. Keep your eyes on the prize case if you want to get *quick*.
The lieutenant does not seem to really want to talk to you. He doesn't seem surprised to see you -- still --
"No one's perfect."
His arms fall to his sides, his spine is contorted and his chest swells with unrest. You've made him weak. And we all know it.
Nothing happens as you try to get closer. All is as it was, you feel, though you are not sure what it *is*.
Something in the other keeps pulling him back from death. Death has bitten off more than he can chew, and now he wants more. And more *chewed*...
Just say you're sorry.
Before you stands a motor carriage. Its bright headlights have left tracks in the dust on the roof of a former silk factory.
She doesn't even bother to reply. You're back in your head. There's nothing more to do here.
The yard is not the *only* thing. Far away mountains of drugs are mingling with motor carriages and wagons on the road. The smell of motor oil, freshly cut grass, and dummy streams moving up on the horizon: that's far away, yet just as it ought to be.
"The place?"
She nods thoughtfully, in silence. "It's impressive, to say the least. For a man your age..."
Alright, let's do this. (Take the Book from the Table.)
You see some national symbols: the Semenine Islands, a reminder of a failed uprising against the Ser
As you've already determined, the actual number is 216 -- but what's a few dots without a hyphen? What's a few thousands without a hyphen?
What a powerful thought! It's something you'll never repeat.
Could it be some celebrity-pawn? You see a *scary* star on the sign -- a skull and bones. The title reads: "Dick Mullen and the Mistaken Identity."
"By your side, I'll make you a sandwich, sir."
Wasn't he one of the first innossence? Could it be an indicator that the land is about to erupt?
In the amphitheatre, a salty curtain of rain falls on a low-grade amplifier. On stage, two speakers blast their music directly onto the metal bench. Next to the instrument, a third device waits, its antennae taking the signal from the floor.
The log has been infiltrated by some kind of microscopic lifeform. It's unwashed hands looking for something to eat. It's *brimming* with carbon monoxide, you think. Soon it will disperse to the Galápagos, the Andes, and even the poles?
A pile of twisted metal and seagull shit, mingled with decaying human remains.
His smile is cruel.
Your tone makes him crack up.
This is unacceptable, do something.
The crimson cockatoo is the symbol for the RCM. A shield of sorts, meant to protect and to unite the RCM and the RCN (Recall Commission). It has failed.
He does *not* identify with this trash-talking. Who's to say he's not just another *surfer* here, an exaggeration?
The greasy old spring mattress lies in wait.
"Okay, okay." He nods with some sad grace.
Sure. We *all* did it.
On your left, the lieutenant keeps his hand away from his holster. You should ask him if he's seen anything suspicious.
It's not. It's disorienting.
Yes, we all are. The sum of all the erratic, involuntary movements and mood swings you've been exhibiting.
Oh yeah, skull and bones! Skull and bones on the Revacholian flag. The Revacholian Death Squad. Oh yeah! The colours are almost too vivid for words. Just look at those abstract shapes. That's what you need to know.
"What happened to the  sky-kin?"
That's brilliant. They all are. All of them -- even the one in the window.
It's death. It's *over*.
Yup. They're not gloating -- they're relieved he's off the street.
As the youths go, so does the lieutenant. He steadies his plastic in his hand while a small metal button is pressed.
The lieutenant is silent, holding on to his coffee cup. It seems like an eternity has passed...
"Never mind. Just do your job -- that's all it is. *Any* job."
"Happens every time I go to the city."
He takes out his notes on the table and under the float light he's working furiously. It's not easy.
(Lower your voice.) "Who can you trust?"
You hold the small pin in your hand, for a second. Then you release it. It feels soft and cold. Just a random thing.
The truth is out there, you an ordinary cop without the *aura*, the incredible and largely unreal. You're in a morass and this is all a crazy dream.
"Snoopy woman."
"A little-" He takes off his glasses, wipes his nose, then puts them back on.
Just like that the music ends. Time to face the music.
"Don't worry, Kim, I won't do it."
There's no *très bon-bon
"Okay. We can figure something out, alright? We can try again tomorrow, can't we? I have work to do."
It appears you're not a Klaasje first or an armourer second -- you're a fugitive of the law, defrauding small business owners and threatening to use your special legal process to take their money out of circulation.
But, he *knows* it's not. He's just in it for the lulz. Who's to say he won't cycle through *lots* of *heros* like that?
"Okay. Was there anything else? I'm confused."
She sighs, then looks at you. Her voice waves as she tries to calm herself: "There's no time for that... talk. Abigail will take care of everything."
He's able to perform at a high level even without his head.
What if you're framed?
Isn't it the other way around? Heavy drinking decreases testosterone... which is good news for you, ergo, ergo...
"Ok, I won't do it again." (Back off.)
"They're 'Futuristas,' Jean. The most boring type I've ever heard of. They like to... 'retro' or 'boombox.' They don't like new ideas, I guess."
The body's settled down into a comfortable position, even the cigarettes lingering. You're still tempted, but you have to be careful.
The lieutenant looks on, mute.
He turns to you. "IMPOTENT SUBJECT OF POPULAR DEMOCRATIC MURAL, I TAKE PITY ON YOU. YOU CLEARLY WANT TO ENTER THE HARBOUR BAD. LIKE A LITTLE BOY WHO WANTS TO GO ON THE POTTY. I CAN PRESS THE BUTTON FOR YOU -- IT WILL OPEN THE DOOR."
She ponders her next move for a moment or two, then nods and says...
"I don't have
"Okay, I know. All right. But... I just can't help but think it would have been so * special* if we'd been able to..." He stops and looks down.
Hulk's rage at the idea of her smoking is palpable.
He doesn't. "They say the jolly-man might have been in cahoots with a local gang. Plotting against the Union."
NO! Keep it to yourself, please. This is *not* about that! No-no-no, it's just a stupid thing you shouldnt do.
He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "We should do this again, maybe, just to see what it looks like under the microscope."
"I do, yes. I always have." He tilts his head. "But for *just* one more question, maybe?"
You've got this. Go ahead, try something, anything...
He is not bothered by your rudeness. He seems genuinely sorry for not being able to help you.
Yes, it's closer to 60-40. 60, *almost* to 60. Just pull it out of him. Shoot
"Good. All that's left to do is pay the tab to Mr. Claire. That should be easy enough, we're all paid already."
The light vanishes inside the concrete sarcophagus. The contents are totally out of place.
One of the most popular drugs on the streets of Revachol is skunk. It's used as a sedative, a barbiturate, a euphoric, a *bendogen*. It may help you to sleep at night, but who knows what it does to your head...
He's too worried about taking out the potty mouth to do anything about it.
With a firm grip you raise the leather jacket. The body here -- thank god -- is cold, untarnished and undamaged.
This isn't true, he just doesn't know where to point. You don't have enough experience to make an educated guess.
You could ask Garte about the singer or Lieutenants -- but what good would it do? Besides, the info is kinda useless anyway.
He stops to think, then checks his notes. "We're from the RCM, you know. We work for that big industrial complex."
Flipping through the book you find yourself within an islet made of shining box-shaped trinkets: softcover, hardcover, and a *special* edition that's barely fit for a three year old.
Hey, what's your story here? I can't tell it unless you tell me where the hell you are!
"No, you don't
"I know what you're saying. Let's talk about something else."
Do something? Blow something? The very thought of touching it...
"We can go and mail this. I'm sure
"Oh yeah. Easy said it. I was glad he couldn't tell me any more. It was quite something, actually, actually..." He smiles, sadly. "He sounds very brave, you know."
Okay. The evidence against the black dog is weak. But, *bratan*, can you still *love* it?
No, don't listen to him! What happens to the constitution of the antlers? They will hold you back, as you fail. As you fail, as a sob-user...
I'm done. There is no life in these woods. If there is, it will leave when you die. Not this one -- no one can bear life.
I got nothing to do tonight, Allis. [Discard thought.]
Okay, how about the old *Astra Whites*, then? All members of the vibrio vituperare group have *signature white lines*."
What did I just *do*? I've ruined the fun for you! What are you going to do, play it like you always did?
That she can. She has to. The bracelet *has* to. The bracelet is an irreversible *devil* that cannot be discarded.
Stop. You're a drunk!
The door has a surprising degree of respectability -- it's yours for now.
It's for security reasons.
There's *some* happiness in the way he says those words. A little smugness.
True.
Before you is a pile of blankets and personal hygiene waste: towels, combs, and other hair accessories.
You're in. Wait for me.
This would be a good time to really *define* the word.
You've heard it before, but what *has* he done? Rewrite the rules of engagement? Ask a rhetorical question? These are not subtle at all.
Nip it in the bud, before it gets completely out of hand. Right on his cheek. Just a side-step, a nibble... Just a side-step.
NOW! Stop it with the THINKING.
"Exactly. All we're saying is that the old soldier was murdered by a self-propelled piece of artillery."
"Didn't I?" He looks up from his notes. "I've spent all these years trying to tell you -- I even *agreed* to *conclude* this case. But I'm *not* buying it. It's all *fool's gold* and I know it."
"What are you *talking* about?"
Back to cop questions.
"Oh, I see." The man nods approvingly. "I'm glad I could help you out with this. There's a basement door in the yard."
"Yes, I'm a little *addicted* to them. I'm addicted to the copotype."
For about a hundred years now. The steady beat of the great city's waves seems to rest on the estuarine cliffs above...
"No-no." The man looks on.
To be honest, it's not that interesting. There's no mystery here anymore.
The dense thicket of plant matter seems to vanish as you concentrate on the stick insect. It appears to be thinking, somewhere in its lizard brain, about something...
There is an old navy blue sports jacket resting on his back, and a small clutchguard overhead. You see a thick, spicy substance -- mustard. It's sticky, like molasses...
Whatever your problem, you need medical attention right away. Don't talk about it on the train -- no one likes a *sir*.
I'm not picking up any theatre-craft here. I'm really doing my best to concentrate as if I'm on some type of island.
Don't
And the law -- it does not concern itself with the waifish man
Without a response, the plume of smoke continues its advance. As the unit head can see, the missile has passed through both barrels.
He's lying.
Of course. Before we go further, should you and Kim look at the guy and Kim?
A little teary-eyed peace. [Finish thought.]
It doesn't matter if you use them or not. You have at least one now.
He sighs. "I understand that. However... I still wish we'd discussed our protocol more. In fact, I wish we'd talked about the thing that killed our friend before, because he seemed... sad. And..." He nods toward the woman.
It is the type of weapon that would fire from a breech-loading rifle. Small calibre, irregularly angled to aim.
That's right. Stupid romantic comedies thrown into the sea because people don't like those who aren't capitalist or communist or... what was it...
"Oh yes, I have -- the Cryptofascist."
What are you planning to do?
Okay, he does *not* believe it's a good idea to call in to a police frequency. But, you know, it's your right to be an asshole.
It is. The bullet hole in Filippe's heart... it's tender interior. Filled with longing, he draws the line with his flesh.
This is the carbon copy of the notebook used by the Man from Hjelmdall to record his journey through the Nach
"It is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen."
Some of those boots probably once belonged to someone who liked to beat their opponents senseless.
"You should have a cool mask. It would totally let him down."
This is different from the back of his head where the brass rivets used to be.
On the catwalk above the shipping containers, an old bearded man stares out at you, his head crowned with a circular hat. The neon-green cargo belt insignia flaps in the light of his welding mask.
I am sorry, Noid. It is unimaginable. I feel like I have no other way to describe you -- less than an *expression*.
Not a carrot, but a hunk of fat on the end of a stick, dangling in the air.
Gone. One bullet out of
The Man from Hjelmdall dies. At the age of 100%, his remains lie in the water, an  unholy mass sinking to the bottom of the sea.
Wait, there are no labourers around?
"I'm not sure I'm buying it."
They're precisely the kinds of things you already tend to get, within the limits of the world.
"No, sir, I don't have anything to add to your file on me."
The artists were impressed by the coherence of the 'Mañana' district, which at the time consisted of mainly coal mines. The artists felt that this was an anomaly and the anomaly is what *seemed* important...
Boring, boring, BORING. This test is pointless, all of this just stops his shit cold and he's done.
*Your* ass, to start.
"What? No! I wanna hear about it. How do you feel about drinking yourself to the point of brain damage?"
"And here I thought my life as a law enforcement officer would be uninterrupted by bizarre smell experiments. The good news is -- I'm back in business now. A little."
He leans in and whispers into your ear: "We should have talked about your obsession with the phasmid, before... But we *also* talk about the forest fire and the lighthouse."
What was that about *what* did he *do*?
Feld Reich -- the former Holy Party, the ancestral home of Frissel the First -- has fallen into disrepair. The older buildings are in ruins, a long time ago. Dust covers the stairwells and the entire air is gutted. All that remains is to demolish the former...
The old man stares at the reeds, then sighs: "Whatever dumb idea it was, I think we can put it behind us."
"Okay, but first of all, the Union is the legal entity that owns the harbour. So there's that."
"Yes -- maybe it is. That is what makes it scary, isn't it?"
"That's crazy, Kim, you can't talk like that."
He is not making a joke, but a deep longing to the reál that runs through his veins.
"I think you're a mythical creature, a freak in the wild, a heat death, that's *too* extreme for you."
Her hesitation is real. It's palpable.
"So there's anodic music in there? Sounds like it would suit you. Right where you're sitting."
Isn't that what you've always wanted, to be part of the scenery? To be one with the natural world?
I'm not looking for the pain killer, I'm looking for the *levity*.
This is probably right... There's something there. But you *know* it's a *pyramid*. You don't *need* to look up anything.
A statistic. The rare statistic! In this case it's the number of *calls* you've taken in the space of *one* hour.
"Titus, I'm sorry I said that."
He looks back at you expectantly.
"I'm going to kill yourself."
"What if I said..." (Continue.) "... that you were suspicious? That you might have been paid a bribe?"
Maybe you should just ask her for a hint?
Feels great. Look at that gush of saliva condense into your mouth... It's *tremendously* better than the last time.
(Turn to the boy.) "Well, do you have a
He stops to think, then adds, "If it makes Kim happy, so be it."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely visible, but you can feel your face reflected back...
There's something going on here. Maybe you should pay attention to *the dark figure* that's always there... the one that comes into *your* office at night, asking questions like you just did.
If you could somehow get the lieutenant's hand to stick it, would you? No. No, *you're insane*. Go ahead, try it --
The old man takes a swig from his flask, then gives the
What? You can't trust me? No, of course not. I'm guessing she just didn't give a shit about that *rapper* -- he
She snorts. "It's not a rum barrel, it's a antler filled barrel. I've never heard of that before. Come on in, let's have a look!"
That's understandable. As a coruscating being, he's really only interested in grand visions and exotic sensation-laden language.
Wait! Maybe you should sing the sad song from that tape you found. Thought it was obvious...
Bigger Guns?
Your fist dives into the trap, you swear you feel the trap pop... Ouch...
"No. You see, she's not just a *legendary* dancer, but an actual *ladybird* -- a superstar DJ and a *superstar dame*."
There was a mention of a *rancor* in the notes. Makes sense, really.
"And then there's the matter of the rotund dame." The lieutenant points at the bed. "You were after her, weren't you?"
You can feel it oozing up your back. A wild infestation of  you-plasmoids spreading throughout your veins.
It didn't give you *any* fun for that money. Nothing. The surveillance self-care measures are worthless in this incarnation of The Art Cop.
"His job? Is his job redundant?"
There's a *weird* mix of glee and confusion in Kim's voice.
What's the difference?
The lieutenant adjusts his glasses.
He's lost his head.
The rat-faced man gives you a strange look.
Grab the gun! The knife!
This might be a way into the Relay At The Gates. You might be able to negotiate a price with the shopkeeper first.
Someone's losing their mind. You should cease your destructive rampage, or we WILL BREAK IT DOWN!
The cold stone slab of the bench does not look welcoming at all at all. You find yourself covered in cold sweat.
"Very well. I'll call you Mañana."
"I mean the commander of the Union's campaign in Revachol."
"There's no such thing as a 'fucking idiot' Kim."
"So it is." He nods. "My ancestors probably carried that cargo, yes."
"What were you trying to achieve, exactly?"
He chimes in: "The-the exit wound's been patched up, B prime. The phasmid has been back here for questioning."
That is a lie.
The expression is almost on his face:
I don't even know what that means. (Shake your head dismissively.) It's probably just your *Cop Sheet* -- front matter copolecular system. Do we have a *Remaining Connections* chart?
The Semenine Kingdom. The name feels exotic, on the move somewhere in the tropical archipelago. It's said that anyone can return to it -- only the *hardened* can really return.
(Turn to Kim.) "What did he say?"
"Are you sure? I mean, look at you..." He shakes his head slowly. "You look like you should have more *control* over your own body. If I told
Hmm, but they're *not* all that *bad. Just ask it like you would ask any normal question...
*Impossible*, Harry. It's not about that. It's *about* the clock running out and time running out. That's all you know.
Forgive me... I have no other way to reach you. You're the voice of Reason, the world's greatest being of reason.
"What? But I wanted to thank you again."
As you've already determined, the boots were probably left on the corpse because they are impossibly small and have zero effect on the scene. You should examine them closer.
"Thank you, sweetie. I'm sure I'll be able to help you out, anytime. Just feel free to ask any questions you have about the church in the very near future."
You should open this one with *some* less sweaty parts.
"I thought you might. I think I might have to."
Look down at the player.
She could come down and live out her life in servitude, like Titus. It's a plan.
Close your eyes and try to see inside your seag
For a moment, the Sonomaan seems to be suppressing something uncomfortable in him. Then he relaxes again.
He's relieved you're here.
Listen within the place of industry itself -- the one with the cockatoo and the accordion, where did they put all this?
"How much do you guys know about Edgware and Howland, really?"
"If you found evidence that this terrorist was in league with the local mob, that would be *particularly* egregious."
The dog barks, but you hear nothing. The walls and floors are as they were, and they remain so because they've held up the order and are thus impervious to tearing apart with impunity.
Maybe you *are* a suitor? What if your *angry* heart can't get over the loss of a loved one?
One day a network engineer by the name of Mike Masone quit his job and... what else? He died on the job, yes, but on an "isolation" detail. Like you've done so many times before.
This man's having a heart attack.
I really, *really* want to tell you.
No... it's not possible. The only thing keeping the ship from rolling over is *her* faith in you.
We're not done, you'll find out what's *really* wrong with you soon enough!
How would you even know?
You're not actually being shown the glow. It's just your visual cortex processing his words.
Fuck that! It's no use cluttering your brain with *hard-core* thoughts. You're only strangling your brain with indecisive questions.
He swears under his breath. "No. That's bullshit. I said fuck it. Let's do this. The love game will be played out in court."
I'm pretty sure you've got that.
"All we can do is keep the rest from following suit."
"If you had to guess who's got the tools to blow this whole place up, Rust Belt Spring is gonna be on the
She frowns. "I am sorry for wasting your time, officer. I should have known you'd..." She breaks off.
There is a general, a revolutionary contempt for authority. He admires violence and bloodshed. It is not only in their *own* veins, but also their soul.
These archipelagos are not as unstable as you would think. In the event of an emergency, the Semenese might take over the entire Insulindian coast.
You're not shitting me. I just said it wasn't you. And I didn't do it by choosing to do it -- I chose to not do it.
"What kind of grenades?"
The lieutenant shakes his head, as though to say: there's nothing more you can do. You're in this case, they said. And you did it.
"Fine by me, thank you." [Leave.]
It's not really a game. It's a *relief* from the tedium and boredom of daily life. In the end, it's more of a *programmer*.
He tries not to look at you -- it's dangerous to *acknowledge* the karaoke man.
"Yeah, Cuno's got the biggest knife around." The little guy looks down and flashes the words "BABE" in the air.
Nothing happens -- the bullet hole in Filippe's heart still hasn't gotten around. He doesn't know any more about her.
"He doesn't wanna be a policeman, he's fine. The honeymoon's over, it was a temporary hiccup." The lieutenant concedes. "That's it, really. Nothing to see here -- just a regular, little setback."
His hand moves out from the pocket -- as if it were about to say something. Not here... Are there any others?
An old-fashioned way of trying to sneak something past your moralist superiors.
Then it's no doubt sending shivers through the veins of the man amongst them...
Another day. Another sad, sad name. Perhaps you can still use your hands and feet to reach out into the world?
Under the blanket you feel cold. The cold finds its way under your skin. You're enveloped, carried away by the scent of whiskey.
I know you don't. But the thought still comes -- she was hibernating after doing it. Takes a moment to get used to the idea...
She deliberately kept her position in the world in which she found herself in.
Watching the riot copner
Your voice echoes on the water. In silence. The lieutenant watches you try to calm her down.
"And what is this woman doing here? It's winter and so much snow. You look like you've been out there a lot."
"Not taking the place over would mean giving the municipality the right
There's more to this. She *knew* it when she took the photo -- but she won't tell you about her. Because she *knows* you're up to no
The lieutenant looks you over, a curious look in his eyes.
Some countries have trade embargoes. It's important to understand what's happening if you want to build a following.
You ignore the phasmid, its mechanical monstrosity still affecting the landscape around it. The building isn't going anywhere.
For the first time in your life you feel like you've reached your breaking point. It's like a strange sensation. But you can't put your finger on it
The reeds rustle and move slowly. No one knows who they are...
"She doesn't know anything about drugs."
It's the claim of the future.
You sense it. Somewhere far
"I know what you mean. I like to look smart. I like to look smart in everything."
He thinks for a moment, then nods. "Very well. I hope this tells you something about us being, well... cops."
In the darkness of your nightmares you hear the call of the kind grey spirit that sings, "Is this really happening to me?" And in the dreams you've had for so long, it seems that something close to you is still here...
Oh my god, get outta here! Let it happen, you're under control now. Listen within the place of authority, now...
"This is a violation of the ANIMAL ACTS CODE. I'm going to suspend you for 90 days."
"His card is missing. His card."
There's really no point in lying to someone. They would only believe you.
"We'll just put her in the shower, prepare for the inevitable -- and then call her. It's all part of the repair bill."
The lieutenant looks up from his notes. "Of course, officer. If you want more, we have more, too. Just ask."
She's kinda cold when she's talking to you, and you're not sure about her sudden interest...
"We were promised..."
"Yeah, Kim, I'm just saying..." She slaps her cheeks, then pulls on her cigarette. "Maybe it's late and you shouldn't have helped him out..."
As you slowly slice into the sandwich, the first few slices start to come off with a *thunk*.
"It's not about the memory hole, cop-man." He takes out his notes. "It's about *tape*. It's all on tape."
Oh my god, *Cunoesse*! You sound like a total bummer. Seriously -- do you think it was a good idea to point that gun at Cuno? It's Cuno who shot the lease at the lever!
"Aye, so here you are. Good to see you again, lawman. I know it wasn't easy for you -- but you still *have* to answer some questions. I know it's not easy..."
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some titles: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Mammoth-Riders," "
The lieutenant looks at you in silence, the light of his cigarette flickering on his chest.
The mechanical pencil in your hand feels cold and slippery. The new ruler of the phasmid is Kol Oblate. It's your secret to teenage power...
Is it? There is definitely something inside there... maybe you should look elsewhere first.
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone. While he waits, a sleet-like stench fills the air...
"I'm sorry, but I just can't bring myself to believe you're still alive."
He looks around uncomfortably, then at the others. "Perhaps we should refrain from assuming too soon. Perhaps we should continue tomorrow morning."
No you don't! Don't yell at the tree! You'll never convince her!
The man seems to be in some sort of trance.
The joy dissipates down your spinal column like a scared little boy. It feels as though you're lighting some kind of bonfire, or throwing some kind of a**. Your face in the freezing cold sky feels like a caricature of the boy, contorted into sad eyes, scruffy and mutated.
"What else do you know?"
Beyond the Hjelmdall there is an ancient history even deeper than the grave -- even Cunoesse himself would have been *older*...
"Why would I want to know that?"
She smiles. "It's a difficult thing for a man of my disposition to confront someone of my caste."
The last thing you hear is a soft knock at the door...
(Let's be real here -- this isn't a good solution.) "Officer, what would *you* do?"
I don't feel like one, either. (Log out of the conversation.)
"Oh, I don't really know." She pauses to look around. "I'd rather *tell* you... I mean, you and I."
Man from Hjelmdall has no time for idle chatter. He sticks up for himself and shouts: "If you don't stop now I *will*."
If he really wanted to end it, he could have done so in *your* hands. You would have given him a piece of your mind.
Be it. Even if it comes to a fight you'll still pick the mad scientist over the faceless man.
Yes, it's unlikely that these men are capable of such monstrous acts. But still -- something tells you: you should be.
Then she notices them.
You don't know how you know, but here's a thought -- maybe you *should* try convincing her?
An old mirror hangs on the wall of the bathroom. You see the reflection of your face in it -- such as it is without *The Expression*. It's just hairy.
He purses his lips. "The data is in the second story window. I came here looking for it -- when Cuno was here. Can't go looking for it on my
The guy hasn't said anything. He's frozen with his hand on his gun.
It's like she's never felt true love before.
In the middle of the stairs, in what must have been a huge, noisy protest, a middle-aged man stands on a swing set in the middle of a broken plaza, surrounded by hard core junkies. Sounds of protest are still being made by him up there. In the middle of a yellow taxidermy.
The yellow manual says the freezer will freeze to the letter "G." What's the problem?
You sound like an idiot for thinking about it, but this doesn't look like a very, very good reason to get angry.
He says it with such candour that it's almost impossible not to fall in love with his theories.
You realize you've hit the keys again. There's a tone on the other end of the line. You can hear the plate clank.
She sounds impressed, but not really. She's nodding her head, waiting for you to show her your finger, like she's some kind of artist yourself.
"And then you were done, officer. You had your cover blown."
Another unspoken word. She's unsure of what you mean.
The cook gives you a long disappointed look after you empty your dish.
A leaflet drops from the botanical column. It's addressed to someone in Rozen, Mor A 'Pen.
Perhaps it's from his oversized frame -- a well-built and muscular man -- not a puppet of the regional maxims, but an actual representative of a regional *maxims*' desire for dominance.
There is *plaisance* here, the plural of *rum*. That is: *rum* is the ancient currency of the *Old New New World*, or Relativity.
He's firmly confident about this. You should take it.
He doesn't know anything about the ropes, what are you talking about? He doesn't know the ropes, you don't have him to talk to!
The racket is even worse this time. Even with the gun and the compressor, it's impossible to talk or even breathe. You close your eyes and just *feel* the throb -- and a little itch.
She sighs. "Yeah, I was feeling really gloomy lately. And not good at all with my work anyway."
He couldn't imagine a more *special* man. Standing there like that.
A marionette is holding a butter-sticker in her hand.
"I did not know the Habaneros had a term sheet."
Punched a hole.
Like him? Father doesn't know how to perform? Don't listen to what your gut tells you. You're fucked.
Don't take it personally. It's a funny line.
"It's funny... At first I thought it was some kind of joke, but after looking around... it looks *terrifying*."
"That depends. If I were to pull the trigger, who would I choose? Not a friend, but a *bino*..." He's lost
And Rainbows!
"It is *very* bad. I'm getting the feeling that there's going to be a funeral."
He's avoiding your gaze.
"That she did. Some puss got under his skin and when he was foaming he... tried to shoot her."
"That's a compliment
Beneath her waterproof raincoat and silk shirt, in her light blue dress, her lukewarm heart has left the insides of her body for you to uncover...
As you turn toward the bay, the sign continues to twirl. In the background, a motor carriage moors on the water -- red and white livery bearing
-- which is to say, *very* little. There are places where the main story leads, but those places are too dangerous to tell in the field.
Odd how he can see things his own size... nevermind the *technicalities*.
But you feel claustrophobic, like you can't get out of it. Then a thought passes over your mind --
The town has taken a beating from a drum that's been beating for ages -- its supplies have been cut off. The authorities have responded by firing artillery into the air,, killing civilians. The inhabitants of Revachol are demanding retribution. You should talk to Garte about it.
This is definitely a minor character. You might be able to spin this around and convince him, but it's a small thing.
He breathes out, heavily, as if something painful just passed through there. Then he straightens his back.
Yes. Maybe you should return to the library if you find one. You still need to figure out what to do with the devil itself.
"Hello, Officer."
Looks like a montage. Some kind of weird retroactive smoking habit.
The pain in your chest tells a different truth -- it was there all along, squeezing the truth from your mouth
It's almost too stupid to believe. You think back to him now -- *that guy*. Doesn't he have a bone in his body before he goes to sleep?
"No, we're not. We've talked about this." He nods solemnly. "What's important is that you're okay."
So that's why he's not into it. It's not about him. It's *all* of them. Maybe yours is different.
How convenient they are there for you to observe. Only recently -- in the late hours of the morning.
No one cares what you believe in, man with the smelly toilet ledger. You're only representing one percent of the *world's population*.
What were they thinking? Let it flow.
He takes a step back, looking at the waves crashing against the pier and the wind slicing through the air... it's a dangerous strategy, but he's making it work.
You have little idea what she means. It could be anything. She's just saying words. Maybe it's okay?
You *do* need to wash it. This is not a long-term solution to your body. It's a temporary one.
I'm almost there, I'm almost there... It's too late to do anything about it now. You've been drinking.
What if we're dealing with an inferior technology than the one Officer Judit was using? Was it his fault?
This tastes *way* bad.
"At first, I didn't want to. But the more I think about it... the more I realize how essential it is. I mean, look at you. You're like a rock and roll star, Mr. Cop."
"I don't know... 42? I haven't had anything else to do?"
Let the weight fall on your back.
Where night falls... Far away thunder, sounds of violence and panic. The streets, the traffic, the people: rising up... above all, the relentless stench of *pulp* that seems to rise from the glands of every awakened
Yes, it *is* very, very, very unlikely to be of much use right now, sire.
"This is ridiculous, I can't do this..." (Turn to the lieutenant.) "What did you do?"
"I saw a woman sleeping on a bench in the little house on the coast. Maybe she has a backpack?"
The lieutenant looks at you in silence, his face parched from the sun and the wind -- you're practically balding there. His glasses are crooked, their lenses are small, their focus is on the man below.
He nods. "They were chanting something. Trying to wake up some old-age church spirit... Trying to communicate with some beast in some old-age."
"Isn't that strange?"
The whole world is still there, in the dead of night, with its lights on and its own reflections in the lukewarm water.
Your words echo in the empty chamber, wafting over the haggling din. Ms. Lenka's gaze follows the money: up to the man's brow.
"I'm sure there are people who can help you, sir. Let's go!"
That's because she doesn't give a shit about anything any more.
As that soft word passes through your mind, the lieutenant draws an x-shaped cross from memory.
The lettering is extremely faint, picked up somewhere along the way. Any guesses where it came from?
"Heeeeeeeeryyyyyy! Roamin' up to my lil' town, Bloomington!"
Keep your eye on these figures in the orange jacket -- and your finger on the key -- as you look for the right time to blow it.
"What I'm getting at is -- *she's* frozen. I'm assuming she had the means to get into the car, but she didn't."
"When I was still in middle-school I started throwing rocks at a crowd of schoolchildren, only to be hit by a stray bullet. It grazed the grazed the beast and struck it dead in the middle of the field. I'm glad I didn't get hit
"A different Kim." The lieutenant leans
"*I* do not." He pauses for a moment, studying your expression. "I don't know what this means. I'm just guessing."
He has already turned away from you in an attempt to conceal his surprise.
"The bike..." He turns to you. "Is inoperable. Too many rotary wheels. The bike was stolen..."
The jolly man shakes his head. "Never mind. Anyway..."
Really? A *reality show* based around a reality TV star? Sounds very plausibly like the Overpinnings of the World.
At first the hanged man does not reply, but he slowly begins to look around, then sits up again.
She was gulping down gas for a long time after the lieutenant passed out.
It doesn't.
Squint your eyes and look at me like you've seen a movie star before.
You're super sane.
"What do I know about contemporary pop music?"
You're clearly troubled by the sight of your dead friend. This was no accident -- you were distraught by his untimely death.
The words leave your mouth as if leaving the syllable is a strange and involuntary emotion.
A sudden flash of pain interrupts your thought, making you grimace.
"But now's not a good time to ask about this. It's cold out."
This is where *Ruby* starts. Ask her about the symbol... it's probably about time we got this on the show.
Check the bed.
Right. So you should go. To the island. Do some *wasted* time there. Rock out, drink some more. Get into his head. Get to know him...
Across the room, the heating system hums its soft lullaby. The mattress feels soft and sheets warm. It only takes you moments for the world to fall away
He douses you with the odd-smelling spray -- a cigarette, maybe? It's a cigarette -- and then looks at you.
"This IS... absolutely *absolutely* not important, officer."
You're okay now. No neck tightens.
"My name is James Joyce. I work in comedy."
Rubbish! You were a solid copper all along. Who's to say that *copotype* is a thing? Besides *red-headed*? Maybe it *is*?
"It's a fucking *guild*. All kinds of people come and go. If you want to join us, fine, join us. Join the Socialists, the Centre, the kids. But if you want to stay... well..." he tries to say, "no."
"You too?" He considers this for a moment. "This seemed like the least I could do. I'm sorry I just can't help you any more."
The hangover, they're making fun of you, calling you a freak? This is not funny... just ask them to stop.
"Yeah, but we're really making progress! We're getting results! I'm so proud of you, Harry, but... it
With an agitated gait Satellite-Officer Jean-Heron Vicquemare paces the side-main, nervously tapping his foot.
Maybe you've been too afraid.
You are a brave man. A police officer -- in your lorry. On the crime scene. With your finger on the *eject* button. Now try again if you think you've got *nothing* to do.
"Not until I've spent my last cent."
I'm going to ruin my good name by lying. (Begin.)
What's going on with *you*?! I just want to sleep... Or... don't even think about it. Just tell me how it is.
You feel the lieutenant's hand on your back for a moment. Then you shift focus to the scenery...
"What I'm saying is -- you're drunk."
The former and current presidents of the Republics declared themselves blessed with two-thirds of a second to fulfill their constitutional roles.
Yes, eat it. It
There's something going on here. You should observe him more closely, after this topic is concluded.
"Yeah, I don't want any part of the Union. You have a huge, elaborate head-in-parry now, and a pretty darn good handle on discipline -- thank me later. You're gonna go to the fire-sick now, you understand?"
They had to hide their faces, wear thick make-up and give all their toys away.
"Easy, fellas! We got work to do here!"
"Oh, okay. There's other things to worry about."
You really shouldn't goading him.
Then you will be indebted to them. Mutual. Parallels. Don't worry.
Not exactly logic. But whatever keeps your hand away from the pages is probably just semantics anyway.
"How does he know this, detective?"
*Possibly* related?
The picture of the *footage*.
The world's most precious material is staring back at you from all the glass. You feel it first with your *own* eyes. Then with the irises of your fellow travellers.
You are not a *bat* and you can't talk about the geography of *places*. We're not *doing* this.
"I'm sure it was pretty nifty, detective, but I'm not so sure now..." He looks over your shoulder nervously. "Will you stand?"
Hey, isn't he the actor George Takei said to have slept here most of the time, you know...
You see some kind of knife under the duvet. There it is, the *what*?! Wait, no! That wasn't a joke?!
He's lying. He's so one with the world, it's impossible to know where it comes from or what it really is...
His stare makes the lieutenant uncomfortable. This may prove to be his undoing, if he doesn't get his medicine...
The first floor overlooks the two hundred kilogram trunk of the old building, like some huge winter monster -- who would have thought an explorer of this planet could be so ephemeral?
"So the missing eighth Hardie boy!"
Outside, a cold wind wraps the wind of Jamrock, flowing through the strata of roofed houses, killing its share of residents...
"The people you represent are trying to help you."
It's the heart. Still -- can you *make it?* You've tried. You've tried so hard. The effect of that one breadwinch is *on* your back.
Before you can respond, the communication robot has already switched off its connection to the outside world.
What you *discover*? I have no idea, we were supposed to open this door. Aaand then you could have sat through *whatever* they had to offer.
Once you've retrieved the 'big gun' -- a royal *barbarian* on the run -- you can proceed to the 'Radiocomputer'.
It's not that Cuno isn't a bike courier. You *were* the one riding in the box, he thinks, trying to make a joke. The box was filled with unbearable claustrophobia.
"I'm sorry I said that -- but they were all unimportant to your work. Now get to work."
It's an optical urban rain forest. Shadowy, really. Don't even try to look behind the curtains. You'll blow it.
The bottom of the pile continues to grow dark, as more and more of the clothes are pulled from the corpse's corpse pile.
That's poor taste. The last thing any of us want as leaders is another's kid growing up to be a police officer.
The codex, like an academic text, is rolled into a library of references. The book appears to have been hand-carved from blocks of wood.
On the islet? There is almost nothing of note in the empty air. The small window stands in mute defiance of the racket.
Under the wind you hear the deserter speak -- "Is this really *us*?" He seems disappointed, *trapped*.
Oh my god, you're about to cry...  FALN pants, my god, fALN pants... This is all you ever do. Ever
What's a little *too* close?
Looks like the toolbox is missing. Anyhow, the bulk of the body is inside the lid, with the exception of the knife, which is missing its blade.
He nods toward the city streets. "I had my doubts about the *first world* part, but now that I look at you -- Lillienne. You're a smart one, maybe you're next in line..."
This person would rather live as a *ghost*.
You're pulling the plug on an emotion after nearly frying your liver. Try not to overdo it.
All around you, the air slowly circulates the islets and marshes of Martinaise, with occasional pops and pinches of rain. On the islands, thick as molasses, life returns to the streets.
"Alright, let's change the subject."
The label "WILD PINES" scrawled on the plastic is folded in half. The lettering is faded from a broken record player.
"We need to talk about the day you lost your memory."
So that's what the scab leader is -- a leader of the wayfarers. You were supposed to take the *puzzle* back, the... question was posed for you.
"Yeah, and he's *still* hanging here!" He seems genuinely surprised that you didn't take him into custody earlier.
The man looks east. "There's an ancient temple to Demeter in the shadow of what used to be a lighthouse."
I'm not making this up. (Turn your attention elsewhere.)
There was an old man, gone is music...
Uncomfortable holding.
He looks to you for some understanding.
"A very hard core life, indeed."
Also, a cargo container hidden away in the ocean has a job to do. It's waiting for you to
They're married.
He looks into the darkness where you came in. There is a strange, almost inaudible hum in the air.
"Whooh, he's so fucking strong, it seems." The woman raises her hand, then extends it toward her shoulder. Her teeth rattle.
And you're really not attracted to *anything*. You're just some average joe. Nothing special.
As you tap on the gauge, the indicator pin jerks as if startled. It's not yet in the red territory, but it's quite *comfortable* here...
"I'm not even sure I can handle this without the boys any more. Ruby wouldn't mind. Ruby would want us to do this."
He rolls his eyes. "That's a cheap chitin' present. What a pittance, really. But it's close enough to the deed. I could have given it to Garte -- and they'd both have *killed* me for it."
"There is no Revolution, she has betrayed the Workers. The Revolution was a success -- for her." He stands with his hands raised in the air. "The last time the working class voted for a *revolutionary* was in '08, this time around."
What a weirdo.
It *will* help you concentrate a bit, you think. If nothing else -- maybe a cross? Oh god...
You look around -- the tent. North of here -- the tent. The tent flap... it's been too long since this part of the world has been living in the past for you to remember *the dross* -- and now someone's pissed on you for not remembering what they were.
Oh, yes. Surely this will lead somewhere worthwhile...
You can feel the bulge in your stomach, and the rising gurgle in your throat. It's faint... and yet you've never really been tired.
Good idea! That's what I meant -- don't rush, I'll give it to you when you're fully awake and alert.
"But I was also curious: Did she ever tell him about her... past? Like she has to tell you every now and then?"
The equation has been worked out. The game is over, but you're left with a bitter taste in your mouth.
"I'm the real evil."
Who cares about the global warming? What's in the world got you this hypoglycemic? Pick up the Brain!
The carbon monoxide detectors register low levels of hydrogen. The cabin around you smells of...
Already did that. Once the instigator thought he's armed he doesn't see it... you're right, you're *cool*.
I guess the law hasn't quite caught up with the assassin. The details of the case are more theoretical than *real*.
"What is *pale*?"
There is *no* fear in him. Nod in agreement with his partner's hypothesis.
"Then you *can't* trust anyone."
"You said there was no 'shit show' and I was over-radiated.' Was there a reason you let her go then?"
You start reading it. First, a *backyard* is lit by the copporooni lorries illuminating the dusk horizon. Then the wind ruffles the leaves, turning them brown.
"How did you two meet? Over the phone?"
"So? What's *really* going on here?"
SHIT MY ASS
For starters, you could search the old fortifications. You know -- like you always do.
Why is this so hard?
Homemade bombs? Yes, *bratan*! Now imagine the explosion of pain that awaits the smoking, screaming human being!
This one does *not* even glance at you as he drops the
What's the word you're trying to catch? Aëno.
A *believer* in your Semenese nationality? You haven't exactly trained your ears to the native tongue of any of the inhabitants of Martinaise, have you?
With an agitated gait, the *man in black* steps out of his office. The conference centres of the world are silent, as he searches for a new data transmission line.
"You did." The lieutenant makes a note.
(Order her to have the sandwich.)
Oh yeah, It's almost there. This is *almost* what it feels like... The ultrafine-tuned metal loop breaks the signal in her Lorryhead MP3 player.
"Oh no, just the single most beautiful building in Revachol. It's even scarier that he's been dead. And he died alone in that strange world. Prisoners like that don't make me smile."
"Reality? I can't see it."
"Fuck are you talking about, pig?"
"No, you're stuck here."
"The expedition was well-organized and thorough. It's not like it is now, is it?"
She was there the entire
You hear him sigh
He nods. "We all do, but -- it's not always so simple, is it? Some folks just want to take a bath, let alone *collect* boots." He pauses. "So, let's not. Anyway, let's get you some shoes asap."
A bizarre sea of pain, burning images.
Your words echo on the water. Far away lights blink by on the nearby moon. Until now...
Still -- your mouth is the very picture of a crime scene. What you're thinking about is beyond this case. You need to repeat it.
The young speedfreak takes a bow: "I take it your Holophonor can read your mind, via the intercom. Any ideas?"
Your inner child is asking what's up with all the *copporoonies* and *cobos*. Perhaps you should open up to them.
Your suspicion is confirmed. Let's go back upstairs and look into the parlour.
The lieutenant looks down at you. He doesn't seem surprised, just skeptical.
"Everything is fine, ma'am. Nothing is wrong. Are you ready?"
So this is how working in these kinds of environments feels -- you lying there, and the heat echoing off the walls, and the engine roaring, and the fumes rising from the cigarettes?
"Well..." The little one on the balcony seems unsure.
"Fine. The rest of you try to figure it out on your own."
There is... a strange glint in the silver of his eyes.
"I know that. I know people who *do* -- people who get really drunk. You know the name? Dick Mullen."
It's harder than she thinks. It's more than you can imagine. Even a super-detective can't fathom how you can just go for a couple of hours on the road like this. It's a miracle.
You might wanna steer clear of that one, too. There's a corpse in there...
Somewhere in Revachol a hulking lump of man lies on a hospital bed, having a heart attack. The color has faded from his face, along with his voice.
What was this? *Disco*?! Aren't you supposed to know? *Disco* is about as good as you will get in that sobriety class.
Doesn't feel like such a bad thing. Your heart has finally pumped all the *speed* out of your system, buster. Now, where was it last night?
"Oh no, no no." His voice seems almost amused, his hands growing large now...
The drugs lord's power is well-known. Those who have met him note his propensity for tossing around colourful terms: *granny* -- for example -- with an impressive *sencer* accent.
She thinks that's horrible how the wind ruffles her hair. It's an awfully stupid thing to say, but she doesn't have to listen to you. You're still telling her the truth.
A gentle wind ruffles the sails. To the west, two figures in sky blue and white stand on the water's edge. One of them looks at the other with wide eyes:
This is me talking about the prybar.
"It's much worse than that. She killed him... her own partner. She would have tried to get me to do it -- if I were to have *blood on my hands*..."
He laughs. "Not yet, I'm afraid. I like to keep things professional, officer."
You hear the click of a blade against a blade as the player character in front of you makes his way to the market stall...
It's all about trust, baby.
"I think I got it, thanks." She brushes her hand through her hair, before returning the toolbox to her lap.
"I'm going to look in the tent, Kim."
Draped in rags, you would be forgiven for thinking you were carrying the sickest man in the world.
You think these *rip's, sting's and bite's* are enough to get by in a rough life? You think so, yes. We all do. But...
Something very strange is happening to him. He's unconvincing. Maybe it's the hangover, but he just can't fathom that you got into this mess in the first place.
He takes a step back. "The point is -- we need to stop basing conclusions on anecdotal evidence. It leads nowhere, and we should probably just move on."
As you wait, your thoughts wander to the diminutive second cousin of theirs, Ignatius the Don Juan.
Aaaaaand not today, you murderous piece of shit! Or... no, maybe you're not, it's impossible to tell.
At the end of the day, it's a numbers game. Whoever collects the most cards earns the most points, and those points are added together to determine who earns the most honour...
Oh my god, you're fast. You're *so* cop. Just look -- *you* got him! You wanna clap? No? Okay then, you don't have to push it.
Confronted him with Kim.
"You're a man, aren't you? I can take the workload myself. It's not like you with all those cases."
"With the total loss of human life in history -- probably the greatest loss of life on earth -- I'm not surprised."
The man before you is naked, but for a pair of underpants and white boots. He looks younger, sort of, with lighter hair and less pronounced scars. His skin is marbled with decaying veins and blotched by lividity.
"*You* are," she agrees.
"Actually, I'm in a bit of a hurry." (Conclude.)
It's hard, but somehow you manage not to See the object, as if it were some kind of miracle. You only see what you can *see*.
"... "In the greatest city in the world
I do? You're *sure* there's a way to pull this off. With drugs or alcohol?
Looks like it's broken. Could this be why Morell hasn't returned to Lena?
If you wanted to show up as a certain age -- you do look like one, don't you? In your late teens -- or early twenties.
He blinks, his mouth moving. His eyes never cease to widen in response to your provocative insinuation.
"No, that's not me. Who am I?"
Before you can heave the wind changes direction again, the building she's standing on being knocked over.
Where to even begin? All you know is, this is *the first* you've heard of the so-called *rebel cells* -- they were probably involved in the death of the little kid.
"Do you know why I'm being let out here?"
He was *done* for.
The *bois* are known to indulge in odd behaviour. You may want to refrain from indulging in it while you're in here.
Put it away! You don't need this *sick amateur stuff*.
You've got your two cents on the matter, so cut him some slack.
It seems that the young man has an entire *professional* devoted to him: none other than the late, great Noel Martinaise himself. Martinaise is actually a *noisy* person, though -- he tries too hard not to be one.
"There *needs* to be a club for anodic music in there. NEEDS TO! It's very much in the
What exactly is a *gisent*?
Noid's drinking buddies
The gossamer structure you've just built is made up of over two tons of tiny little rain-soaked sticks and stones.
In a small office behind the Old Military Hospital, hunched under the green glow of his desk light, officer Hans Blau browses through a test print. After a while, he says:
"No..." She stumbles for words, then manages a feeble smile. "What's wrong? The trap just woke me up."
You see blood and smoke all around you. In the distance, the sound of metal moving -- on the plaza -- can be heard.
There is something moving in the darkness between her fingers. A silhouette in the shadows, walking in the shadows...
There is an empty cigarette package in the centre of the table, beside two packs of Camel. There's a gold star pinned to the back.
"You mean blue jacket?"
The *incompetent* cop? Try again, please.
"And to think, there *was* a funeral for that actress..." He points at the doorknob. "She turned out
Wanted to show people why you're a police officer -- *not* to mention *yourself*. What's on your mind here?
"What do you mean? They'll fall if we get into this."
It's meant as a joke.
You're seeing it, yes. What follows is pain
The father time has not carried the three decades. It's but a cardboard cutout.
No-no. He's talking about the sky, all right? The sunken motor carriage. The phasmid -- it too is no phasmid...
But this *series* is different. It feels like someone ripped off a huge episode from the end of the *war game* they're playing on the neighbors' televisions.
You see a hypostasis dog-fight going on in the background. It's difficult to say if the dog is being activated for combat by the music -- or if it's just excited to get back to its owner
She's not hearing you. You're really quiet.
STATION CALCULATOR FOR LARGE COMMUNICATIONS; SOCIAL MEDIAX OPERATIONS; *AND* *THE LAST MAN ON THE ISLAND*.
Actually, there are a lot of other places where people walk. You could also go into the ocean, or do a bit of panicking *fishing* around. But *boreal recreation* is not one of them.
What's *garbage?* You think you hear something, but it's hard to make out what it is. Some children have called it *The Roonie*...
A place where they can live off this world!
Really? The bad thing is, *bratan*? Sounds like it's only a *judgement* -- can you trust them?
"And what does she do, then?"
A difference of two kilometers. A powerful missile barrage was fired into her apartment -- she heard the shot, saw it coming.
"Might be a good idea to open your eyes a little more... see the world for what it is."
A streetlight casts shadows on the tiny chamber.
In her mind, the constrictor vine was a part of the *Old South* that had to be eradicated -- by using physical force!
"Do you like to drink?"
"And it's not clear who took it. Now the case is a "hoax" and we have a "coupon for your station" -- the suspect is an *undeserving* suspect. I think?"
It's *exactly* what he needs. He needs to hear that you can trust him. The sooner he starts talking, the sooner it will end.
"No one fucking does anything like that any more, thanks to you... You're still a hooligan, Harry."
The wind blows. Across the water: The reaches of the Insulindian town square. In the square -- the remains of the once mighty *Revacholian lit* movement. Some half-completed twin towers now stand high above the boardwalk.
The tiny hound of human tissues that watched over the corpse wants to sniff the cadaver's pockets.
Swaying on the waves, the beau passes through the slit in the ochre-coloured plastic. As it reels to a stop...
You don't know how you know, but there she is, in a bathing suit on the covers, your violent, hungry little partner.
"Does this have anything to do with the building you're in?"
It would take a village to raise a child, not to mention the damage that would be dealt to those that are left behind.
The door to your room has been locked again. Perhaps something helpful for you?
It's a mystery, you shouldn't waste time theorizing. He looks like a *nice* cop -- he got the body of a nice guy, but the soul of an an outlaw.
"K
The netting is loosing *stability* at a frightening rate. Something's rotting inside it. You should be careful.
Don't be an idiot. You can't keep the lieutenant from knowing what to say.
"I'm no rascal. I'm quite rambunctious. In fact, I'm quite anti-social, but that's beside the point."
Probably for the best -- your 12-40 month supply will last you *only* a week or so. But then you could push it again.
No, it's not happening. It's a placebo effect. People love seeing their likenesses on walls, so it's not a bad idea to give them a break.
"I think we can leave it at that."
"No," he whispers, his voice suddenly soft. "She killed herself in the armchair. Why did you do that?!"
In that room, a rare butterfly belonging to a different species, probably the butterfly off the balcony? Anyway.
Catch the silver bird.
It is a strange moment. All sudden you feel as though someone is standing right next to you, touching your shoulder.
"Take this guy on, Cuno."
"Don't know if I've ever
But the questions don't seem to have anything to do with it.
Somehow you managed to get yourself out of this one. Now quick, keep the momentum up, you need to turn the tables on him!
You've been conversing with the amiable ghosts.
"I need to talk to the bossman about the cafeteria manager. Do you know where he is?"
Who is this?
It's the showmanship of bad ass moving around. Be careful now, and don't let her get away with *not being herself*.
The dishes... The tables... The chairs... The lights are all gone. You have no memory of them.
Put 10 cents in and dial a random number: 001 -- 87 -- 32 -- 91 -- -- 32 -- 181 -- 41 -- 161 -- 212 -- 5 -- 249 -- 9 -- 81 -- 25 -- 212 -- 75 -- 25 -- 66 -- 63 -- 9 -- 171 -- 171 -- 5 -- 165 -- 165 -- 9 -- 121 -- 153 -- 195 -- 52
To your right, the lieutenant steps aside as you concentrate on the words.
In a cell, drinking cold water, you and the wind from all over the world.
Please understand: I'm not trying to humiliate you. I just want a competent professional to do my job.
"Do you feel anything? Does your back hurt from all the running around you've been doing lately?"
I *hope* you don't. The feeling will last a lifetime.
"The buildings on this coast -- and especially this church. I need to be sure it's all connected."
The door bounces a few times as you open your ledger. A moment passes, then you write:
The answer is self-explanatory. As to not inflame the subject, fine.
Not that he has to worry about getting old yet -- he looks and acts like his 73 years.
Whatever is making this hunchback might be, it feels like there's something *wrong* with him.
"We aren't going to do anything interesting here any more. We're not going to call the police, we're not going to break any windows. We're not going to do anything," he turns to you. "We're not going to *see* anything."
Leave the boots at that.
The surface is interrupted only by a solitary windstopper: the little sailboat in the drifting tide.
Look, it *is* interesting. The fisherman looked like he wanted to lose his head in the ocean.
Look, there's *blood* on your hands -- you're *from* River Esperance, right? Right!? You must be drunk too! And this is the nightwatchman too!
She's making a stab at removing the magnet from the pole, but first you've got to beat the magnet with sticks.
Your hand moves, smooth and lightning-fast, to the holster -- but you don't have time for your fingers bruised from the bump.
You should go on stage and give the officers a thorough, *complete* look.
"That's so, sweetie, exactly like the sort of thing they would do if they found the headless soldier." Her son nods, gently.
Out of frustration with you failing to pay child support, he decides to take a swing at your estranged wife. Unfortunately for him, your fist is in his face and he doesn't have a weapon to *stab* with...
Your word here is not as reliable as yours.
Some specks of dust shimmer in a faint beam of daylight falling from the window. Other than that, the room is almost empty.
"But I still need to know your name."
The way he holds his hair, the salt and the sun, the light in his eyes... You can almost see his face move as he says it...
"I'm not about to jump that route, sir."
Go ahead, ask her about the corpse-fridge...
"Ha-ha." She giggles. "But a great many of these intelligent races are extinct or otherwise very much diminished."
That's me, Dad!
The producer turns the generator off and does not return the radiation emitter's flame to its emitter's mouth.
The snow falls on her shoulders, then melts in her light blond waves. "I'm lucky to be here," she says.
"Alright. My *deceased* partner, Ronnie, comes to look for you." She squeezes her silvery handkerchief around her neck, thinking it will dull the shock.
"Of course, detective. I hope nothing sinister happened."
"... but this place is *doomed*, sweetie. They all are. They're done."
"If you're sure..." He rubs his face in frustration.
Cuno practically spits on the pavement at you, his cigarette smouldering.
You can feel it: two massive shoes, both gaunt and sad, touching each other with cold, blue-grey shoe laces.
There's something moving in the waves... a greasy-smelling mixture of bones, fats and sugars. The mix seems to growl somewhere in the distance, with a sickly sweet smell of rotten food rising from it.
With a twitch of his neck, he ducks behind the curtain.
On the not-so-edge of the boardwalk, in a small building overlooking the water -- an old grey building with black mouldings rising up from the water. There's something about it...
Punch the bottle.
And *another* thing: she has no fear.
His friend hands you the key. "Here it comes... the *Spirit* came too. The Intellect is what you thought it was -- a quartet of ears, a spit fly in a quartet of tongues."
It's going to take a lot of work to get Kim to talk to you, investigation-wise.
You pull the trigger.
That's odd. He seems like a *regular* police officer. Doesn't mean he's a regular cop.
"So... so what's next? Next stop?"
A3-FORMED ROYAL MURAL.
Find a moment.
Suddenly, from the darkness, you hear a sound. It's *vanilla* -- the crashing of bones.
Oh yeah, please! You can't trust them. There's nothing more suspicious than a cop with his or her head held
You can't. You're keeping it together. You need to focus
"Indeed, my friend. For all we know the Eternal is still reigning supreme, though. We may yet see a way to quell its violence, if we only dare so. And we may soon have *proof*."
"Something we can help you with -- the body is missing. A black patch in the grass just south of here."
All of this built around two 'phenomena'. The first was called *The New*. It was a vacuum-formed grenade that *everyone*
He does not remember what he's doing.
"What about the youth centre?"
Okay. If I don't like the answer, I'm gonna change the question. Go on, the questions are coming...
This isn't what *the law* ordered us to do. It's what *you* ordered us to do. Between you and me, you may have even convinced *them*. But you're the LAW. Period.
Uncomfortable precision. The lieutenant prefers to just say *case sensitive* here. You should really get someone to do this for you -- maybe even *on* the phone, if it's possible...
The King, the, the The. Always the same joke. You will have to start over if you want to find out who really killed who.
This isn't *just* a carousel of cars lining up their seats -- there's a man inside, a real ticking time bomb waiting to go off.
"Is that it?" She backs away from the fence, uncertain. "Is it mine?"
"We're all trying to do what's best for Martinaise here. You're helping us, and we're helping you."
"There is no trickery, this is real."
"Couldn't it have been *some* of them? You don't have to be a teapot, I've got you in this. Just ask."
"I'm not making a statement here, but maybe -- a *little* perspective? On the Beachhead, I mean."
It does sound *extremely* dangerous. Far away drones buzz in the distance -- small, like tiny. Then the sounds of the street are swallowed up in a kaleidoscope of colours, intensities, and densities.
I am not. I am not even sure I follow what I'm doing. All I see is a broken mug with a racist depiction of *the yellow man* frolicking in saffron.
The bed is cold and not particularly inviting, but it's yours. The sheets look awful...
"My contact mic is dead."
"This is a major undertaking. We are *deep* in the Blaasma."
"Of course. I'm glad you're not panicking over the phone."
"I'm sorry, but I think I've got to say, that's really poor choice of words there. I actually think you should... go."
"Troy, the local mafia boss. He's not very friendly to outsiders. We got our noses in his goods."
"Literal *napakymppi*... Kfri is one of the *most beautiful cities in the world*, but it's also one of the most dangerous. The RCM's Protective Campaign has seen casualties on the streets every day for the past four years."
There's a rusting register from years gone, reverberating through the chimney. A hearth fireside.
"Who would've thought? They get on in their mausoleums with impunity. Now, if only I had my capital..."
A soft rain falls on a dirt floor. Moist dirt, wet to touch. Some kind of corpse has put their remains in it. You see the smell of rotting food rising from it -- something to eat, a knife to be cut with.
Oh yeah. This is going to be great.
An old mirror hangs on the wall. You see the reflection of your face in it -- such as it is without *The Expression*. It's just hairy.
"*They*? All these rooms could be connected. Every room could have a key. You could open the door to the other rooms -- with a key. Or maybe even use a key to get in..." He sounds amused
I don't need a booze-and-pillow party. I've got a fuckin' air-plane party.
"Go on, about the pipes -- it *does* look like you had a hand in it. I got this... chalked up to being high on the hey-day of his life, all fucked up and in pain..." He pauses. "It's just a little note -- I don't know the whole story."
This means we're still in the hands of the Föminist. Could this have been a good moment to get rid of him? Hard to say, all things considered...
Slowly, you move your hand toward the figurine. When you reach the bag, you're surprised to find it empty... Did someone leave the bag in the car?
"For once. Good to see you here, special consultant." He hugs the door. "You must be Kang, right? I know it's not -- but I was hoping you would be more helpful..."
The floorboard doesn't seem to notice the candour, but the toolbox looks like a chipped mugger.
There's *a lot* of things wrong with this picture, Harry-boy. Try to turn it else around.
"You look a little sick...
Fucking would not *change* that. This ain't about that.
"I wouldn't have thought of that."
As you step closer, you notice virescent PLAY and PRINT buttons on the keyboard. A hatch connected to the central compartment is wide open.
"Yeah, I'd walk right past you and just *slip* right through the gates. Let's get back to the mysteries, shall we?"
Not good, *bratan*! If you want to achieve anything, just *get through this*.
The day has not made the sheets any less coarse. It's just that the sheets have become even finer.
"Okay, but..." The lieutenant looks up. "What do you mean, Officer Disco?"
He looks at you as if you've been kicked in the stomach. "Don't worry, lieutenant. I'm sure it'll turn out okay."
It's not a problem for him to be, but he shouldn't be without a gun. Especially now that he's angry at you for bringing it up.
At first the lieutenant doesn't say a word, just looks at the piles of blankets and slouched over.
He draws a contract card. "I will. At least for the next two days. Otherwise I'll call Abigail."
*Boom boom*. Loudness everywhere!
He puts his glasses back on. "It's not impossible, and it's probably not going to happen. I've made *some* mistakes, but there are bigger fish I'd rather avoid..."
There seems to be a contradiction here: If *Kim* is the author, then *Kim must have been drunk when he drew these lines?*
"Yes, comrade. I've got this *dead body* in my tent."
The boy picks up two hammers at once and puts them back down with a loud thud. "No way!" he shouts to the memory in his head. "You're right!"
The woman hiccups, then whispers again: "It's your breath against his face and your soul against your chest, brother... but you're strong..."
"A solution to the *doom* of Revachol." (Say it with a grin.)
Also!
You are literally a sample.
Write it down: Short, light brown, male pattern baldness.
You see the lieutenant watch you jerk some tears away from your face. You're still in that mister's head, he's too busy laughing to care.
Before he can finish his thought, however, the lieutenant leans on your shoulder. "Listen, just try not to freak out. We're here to do a *thorough* investigation, not worry about petty stuff."
He frowns. "You know, I'm not usually one to share candour, but... well, you should ask him about the Fat Angus sandwich first, okay?"
There was never a time when he wasn't a member of the ruling class.
You approach the statue, hesitantly. As you wait, you think: *Did someone say something here?
Weird... how?
"Yes, very. You're young and impressionable."
"Wait -- so *I* know the ropes."
The woman has left the diner. The young woman I
The lieutenant looks at you intently. "And what exactly are you doing?"
You can feel a tinge of nostalgia toward this jacket. A nostalgic fondness.
Okay, the lung cancer thing wasn't actually on the cards. You have to wonder if he's lying to save face -- or if he just really likes badminton.
Catch the silver bird, the nest of the seal.
"Not *necessarily*, I'm sorry to tell you, I have a feeling about this... Mr Dros -- this may prove to be a dark lesson for our relationship..."
"Pity!" The lieutenant turns to
"Taut, our young man!" the lieutenant shouts from the balcony. "Keep the matter moving!"
Your heartbeat quickens, the storm clouds around you grow darker, and the great district hums in your ear: The Spillane Quarter.
But who drove the truck?
All we can find is each other.
I want to know about yourself.
"What the fuck is a gate?"
For a moment the tie seems to split into two pieces, while the rest of the body remains in place...
What was that about Established Provinces?
He's obviously a huge fan of Mine We're Making Progress Everywhere.
Things to do, things to be done. Don't dwell on the past. Plan ahead and choose wisely.
There are many paths to follow... the only certainty is that you must identify the object before it leaves this world.
The dead man stares in silence as you rattle your fists. He does not comment.
The table is littered with broken appliances and unwanted knick-knacks. A faded photo shows the author smiling next to a listing of broken products.
He's right -- like you in every other way. All variations.
"How old was Evrart Claire?"
Is it like the girl got tired of hearing about you and your weird behavior and left you? Or is this another one of your tricks?
Don't be ridiculous, of course not. This is not about *you*. It's about *the book*, it's about the *radical republicans*.
"That she didn't do it -- that she was *wasted*?"
"Actually, I've been thinking about selling the gun."
Read the file cabinet.
"I'm just gonna sit here and watch you kick some guy's ass."
He clasps his chest tightly. "Are you sure? For some reason you think it's better to say this -- and it is a *thing*
"The smell is awful and the fiddle-person looks like shit."
SALT LAKE CITY -- Amid rising seas and motor carriages, inland water and phasmid-infested sewers, on the fringes of *B�te-de-Na-Da-F�lle*. This is Salt Lake City on the Gulf of Frissel, the sixth largest city in the United States.
A weak red vein of coal suddenly rushes to your nostrils. You cough, but it's barely in. Then...
He ignores you. "Perhaps if you were to stand in just one place, in this very corridor, please." He points to the antenna. "Hang on, let's investigate..."
The vice chief is nodding so intently that you're tempted to ask him to look into the hat rack. But then you realize he *might not* be okay, and if he is, he's hiding it well...
Not you too. You're just *the cop* and this is some schoolyard shit. Let's put it aside.
"What you do know, Kim, is that there are those who would *never* dare to raise their voices against those around them. And there are others. Maybe they'd die? Or..." She quickly looks away.
The pain is too immense to scream. Even under the adrenaline, it feels like someone's breaking their prized possession. You have no other option but to reach out and try to help her...
Something for later? Spying on your friends? It's useless. The case is not over -- more interrogations are bound to reveal more.
You're free to do as you like with the artefacts, but you might as well make sure you're on the *right* track here...
"Bagged it," he nods. "Had to."
Think you can get anything else out of him? From that shit we talked about? This ain't no spooky movie, it's just normal everyday stuff.
"I should have a look..."
After several turns the system has stabilized into the town square. There are few, if any, residents left in Revachol West.
With a loud splash the radio waves travel hundreds of paces. Around you the air is suddenly void of sound. For a moment it seems like the world is ending -- and you can feel it.
"I'm doing *nothing*," she answers for you.
She stares at you, frozen. All she sees is your half-open eyes and a hint of something twitching behind his eyelids...
What's a *bröderbund*?
And she kept them *tight* in those skimpy clothes, that she bought at the thrift store. You see the back of her
The Hjelmdallermann arcology is a veritable *wilderness* of drug-smuggling. The surface is dotted with unused rocket fuel from the previous mission. The firetraps add another layer of seascape. 
The guy looks at you, then at the snowswept horizon, then back at you... He clearly enjoys his hiding out from this awkwardness.
The pillow is comforting, but it's made of soft fluffy food that melts in your hand. It would've been much appreciated if you'd brought along a small parcel delivery service, but you don't. What's more, you're now angry with the world. What would the world look like without you?
The little rat-faced man looks at the two of you with bloodshot eyes, then disappears behind his glasses...
Your heart gives one little nod of encouragement...
The words "What's so fascinating about that" sound reassuring to you.
He points to the empty netting. "And this is my - big brother Roonie. We will be looking up to him, remember?"
With every turn the Nachtherrer summon more and more *wires*. The mechanical arches that hold them closed...
He does not want you two to *get* into a fight. This *could* have been the reason he dropped you off at the station.
Wait, it says in the bottom right corner of the screen there's a *hole* in the world you can *jump* to, right?
As you look up into the faint sky, the boy keeps his tiny frame straight and his gaze on the ground, not quite...
"For god's sake, stop SHOUTING!" The enraged man snaps at you.
"The Claires are back. They've been bringing things up, telling us how bad it was. Since I got here."
"Or for those who *really* do have access to the drug trade, I guess." He pauses, looking toward the sea. "I don't want to make things *any* more difficult for ourselves -- but
"Then let's get to work." [Leave.]
Rapha's reputation precedes him. Surely the big guy at the counter is familiar with this modus operandi.
You seem to have pushed him too far, he is afraid now.
"And what do you mean, *what* is a *boreal critter*?"
In spite of itself, the red board is extremely well done. Its edges are chipped and torn, spots by shining beams of light. The faintest smell is of chemicals, in the air.
Oh, he wants the *boots* back on. So we can go shopping. Way back... there *was* a boot that fit...
"We came here to ask questions. It's not something we *do*, man. We come to *try* and ask questions!"
Then show them how *worthwhile* they've been tearing it up in Martinaise.
"Cuno's making a whole LP of what you did?" He laughs. "He's like Cuno's little buddy now. Cuno's just got a shop, pig gets out there every day and does what Cuno wants."
"Are you, like, a racist now?"
This is the Impossibility Holy Grail.
A vision of burning rubber. A dream? Do you still want to wake up? Probably not. You will never stop falling into the black water.
No one remembers the last time they were this lonely. Perhaps you should go on stage and tell the story again?
"She asked for you and I agreed."
Your body is ready.
Her tone isn't threatening, but there's something in the manner in which she answers...
An opium den mother of pearl, that sweet of mother of pain. Don't drink it. That's not the right thing to do.
No, it's *stuck* on loop... Whirling, spitting out words and images. Loose sheets of paper sag from the clipboard in your hand.
You're going to have a lot of time to think about this later -- perhaps too much? But first you need to decide what level of our of police you want to enlist.
While you can. Just stand there in front of the mirror for a moment and have a little cry.
Wasn't *Klaasje* a *fake* hotel?
"And what would this all lead to?"
"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you -- I have *real* police work to do."
I don't care if you are a cop, I only care about my *detective privileges*.
"The trip to the sea is going fine." He glances wistfully over his shoulder. "I'm practically under the weather."
You still have to find a copy though, and then market it to some serious thrifts.
There's a touch of bitterness in his voice. Even now, 35 years later, he doesn't want to spoil it for you.
The red-dyed fuel oil is run over with a vacuum pump. A single cylindrical block lies inside -- just like the one that the victim used.
All of this... the serendipity of the phasmid, the dazzling interstitial space between its rapid eye movements...
A brazen effort to pull stunts, and even some stunts -- but *what*? Most are pulling -- it's a joke, and a sick one at that. The system is broken, and someone's *missing*.
"It was just *luck*. The natives had it -- we had it. Luck is the foundation of our civilization." He tosses his head again. "And my father was a carter himself."
He's right. All that charred wood looked like an *amber forest*. Opaque to the naked eye, but not to you. You just can't *proceed* now.
Wirrâl
He sighs. "Yeah... so that's why no one's been talking to me. Why'd they stop talking to me?"
Let's stop.
Judging by that, Kim's right -- he should have
A faint sadness.
It may be the only way you've ever really been in the presence of honest men.
"A giant insect. Hissing like a cuckoo."
I'm sorry but it feels like you've been *living* *on this planet* for a *long* time now. You look tired.
The lieutenant leans closer. "Are you sure you want to press that door again, detective?"
"Uh... what?" (Cough.)
"Hello. I have a cigarette every night. It's my third time." He pulls on his cigarette. It's something of a ritual.
"Kim, look at this painting! It's *my* painting!"
He has clearly done his math on this. There's no other option. You need to stop listening to this guy's ideas and only progress is possible.
The speakers below the console appear to be still a bit busy, but otherwise in working order.
There's something about the way she carries herself... A man accustomed to being alone has to adjust to the sight of a woman who's affectionately referred to as *that pig*.
Wouldn't he have to be a bit more *presidential* if he wanted to win her back?
He's being played.
With an oath he can't get off the pot. Keep it civil. Try to keep the pressure up by saying *I *m interested*.
An instant camera -- the Special Policeman Ferdydy *Ferdydy Lite*. A golden light bursts out of its hidden compartment!
By the way, where *is*? You don't have anything else to do -- it's time to keep looking.
"Nah. Kim, I think you need a bath -- let's do it."
"Everything a science geek should be afraid of, can be answered with a few *pinches* of blue."
That *nice* guy... he runs an antiques shop in your neighbourhood. Maybe you should talk to him about the rafters.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here. There are still many unanswered questions and things you should still do, even if you have to invent your own paths...
"She just wants to help. She's really good at this."
Distracted by memories.
He smiles. "That's a charming name. It makes me feel old -- and kind of cool, actually."
His *vampiric* side-effect, oh my... that's great. Go ahead, drink *the ghost shit*
"Oh, sweetie. In all honesty, I've always wanted to talk about my life before my early death."
"Wait -- did *you* make the call?"
Fleeing an indictment?
That awful word rings through your mind as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass.
Lucky you. You still have a lot of inhibitions, he thinks. Even he knows it's forbidden. Maybe you were too eager to get into this. But still...
"Alright, Mr. Dros, do you see anything interesting?"
Do the same.
He's a good pilot. Just not great at all.
The man stares at you, eyes bloodshot. His knuckles are white and the corners of his eyes are swollen shut.
You still could have gotten a good view of the intersectional question by looking to the horizon from the window upstairs.
What is this, a joke now? Don't do it!
That's probably right.
He taps on the plastic wrap holding the blanket tighter. "The body is cold, the corpse is cold. Now let's proceed."
It is the path of least resistance. She is most vulnerable, but also most self-conscious. There will be times when she has no choice but to bend the rules just to keep the investigation going...
It hurts! The blood hurts! Unbelievable, all of it, all of it! Even the small sardines, the crinkly little things, some as large as peas...
He pinches the side of his head. "Okay, we're cops, that's who we are."
"It didn't come up, detective," she tells the old woman.
"Can I have the key to the shed then? I'll check around, see what's there."
"I'll make up for it, alright, I promise."
"No, I think we'll go with *officer*. It's much better we talk to her -- so we're not doing anything stupid..."
"It was something I had to come up with myself."
No. A place of deep, soul-searching. You know these people are not real. You don't talk to them, observe them, even *consider* coming into your life for a moment. You'll have to come back to this later.
"Someone?"
Maybe you could *diversify* your business with this "great" system. Turn that profit center into a *magnificent* wall, you see what he means.
You try to whisper in his ear, but no sound comes.
Incorrect. Your Innocence Dolores Dei seems to have a strong personal relationship with Dolores Dei. Even after this head-spinning, she seems to really miss you.
"Just let us know when you're done."
As the two disappear one by one, your thoughts, your feelings, your dancing limbs... The <Amber Die With An Edge> Party Spirit has claimed their turf.
She's lost and alone.
Encyclopedia, city, museum, city of Revachol, Evrart Claire..." She makes a double head count: "19 people have been here in the past week -- 19. So far. A total of 22 people have seen her."
You think the FALN gear might hold the secret to beating Ruby? Perhaps Ruby herself might know something...
A whole lot of things are wrong with you right now, but you just can't seem to *get it together* any more. You spend the next few minutes trying to solve every loose end in your erratic mind, but it's almost all hopeless.
You have the most beautiful ring, baby! Have you ever seen a more beautiful guy in your life?
"I'm looking for a woman who's missing."
That's not the real reason he's so annoyed.
Don't listen to what *this* guy* said, Mr. Reality Bummer. You can't do this shit without your dick.
"You're welcome." (Conclude.)
As much as I want to, I don't have *enough* time."
You are stuck here, Harry. There is no other way. It's *unnatural* that you are alone. No one comes to you.
Momentarily his partner Tony Stark feels uncomfortable.
You do realize you have to come up with at least one more thing to say, right? One more thing, before you close your eyes and fall into sleep...
"So am I. What was I thinking?"
So this is what being an  irregular feels like. In some way it is -- being
Why is it called the *heckler*? Are you a *heckler* now? Are you a *hero*? What makes you different?
This means it's well funded. The trip to the funeral was probably finalized in order to give the mystery investor a run for his money.
Good. So many aspects of human relationships are rendered meaningless by medication -- maybe you should just be on it.
"Yes, I am a feeling kind man, Harry. Even when I am feeling very bad things."
Your finger finds its way to the small piece of plastic on the side of the machine. You take it and pocket it.
I guess I *should* take it. [Leave.]
The Dei is looking directly at the congregation eye beams shining through the window. In it he sways, smiling.
The pantry has a half-empty beer bottle in it. The lieutenant does not say anything.
He looks at you, eyes wide with feigned surprise... Could it be that you're about to start singing again?
"Your Honourable Coppo!" the tall bloke salutes you.
There was never any other way. The lion's share of the story has to be told. And it *did* have to be told.
"Museums? Who owns the 'museums'?"
One of the hatchbacks has failed to turn on its engine. The hatchback is covered in smoke, and no movement on the roof outside. The engine is cold, and sure enough, there's something seeping in through the broken window...
Your jaw clenches. Your tongue moves in your mouth. A hot flash of anger comes over you...
You wouldn't like it either. Being an untaxed writer, you're not used to this.
"This is why I don't talk to girls."
You have to intervene on behalf of the discoverer of *the curse*. 
No-no, we already took that bribe from that Joyce woman. Remember?
It *does* look like a voyage to Graad... but it's a riddle. It's a *garbage mountain* in the desert. A riddle that says: "Water from the Great Salt Lake in Central Jamrock."
But I'm afraid my body can't take the *speed*. The hangover will return, in *another life* -- somewhere between here and the Martinaise Inlet.
To be
You see, Old Filippe wasn't just good at squandering the local economy on gold and shiny rocks -- he was also a prodigious snorter of nose candy.
"Wait... who are the *Union guys* then?"
There's more to the deed than the lieutenant has time to comprehend. Talk to Kim, after the break...
Stupid twist. Who would have thought? He would have liked it.
The lieutenant opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again. After a while he says: "No, I'm not sure I can judge. Maybe you should try looking at something other than them."
Then should we do it again?
"Is this the first time you hear that?" (Show her the gun you found in the Whirling's trash.)
He turns to you. "YOU COULD HAVE USED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OVERCOME YOUR NARROW, *AL GUL* RAVAGED IDENTITY. INSTEAD OF UNLOCKING THE RACE ENIGMA, YOU ATTEMPTED TO *ADD* TO IT -- UNSUCCESSFULLY.
"Nah, it's very easy for a police officer to get bored." He looks at the twisted metal gimpsus he's stuck between. "I'm just telling you the truth, gimpsus. After the war we all..."
A small flash of pain.
Yeah! Don't you wanna turn some more psycho?
"There's nothing to discuss, officer."
An armored suit? Don't let it fool you -- this isn't just another military decoration for your desk. This is an OO keeper!
She means it.
The man takes another drag of his menthol cigarette, then looks around in the tent. "I think we might have another question for you..."
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. As well as
"Wait... What about Klaasje?"
He exhales sharply. "I have a feeling Joyce knows how dangerous the situation really is. We *have* to get her to talk to us."
Keep your cool. Be a raging idiot.
"I know, yes I do. How does it feel?"
You close your eyes and imagine the strange - mechanical-like-sound of the machine's engine. Then you close your eyes again and imagine the strange-smelling vapour rising from the man's chest down into your lungs.
The lieutenant nods, then juts it down in his notes: "The drive was part of a *naming *action*. It ran aground in the remotest part of Jamrock."
"I don't want to be a communist."
"Is he *troubled*?"
Not if you have anything to do with the case. (And you *know* you *can't remember* why you started it. Why did you ask, or what you wanted?
"Okay, so she was alive at the time the pirate held her hostage?"
"I see." She nods. "Anyway, you guys *did* see him."
He scratches his head. "And you should look into it, some of those cases might be connected to these..."
"So which one do you want to buy?"
Caveats: There is a ceiling and stairs leading up to it. You should have the full plans in hand for when you need to inspect it. Also, there may be hidden passages leading to other parts of the cave. If you examine them...
Try it on her.
No, don't listen to him. This is already *bad* for you. It makes you less of a man. A *negative* hypergiant.
There is an answering laughter in the room. "Oh, it's *that* guy from the building. That guy was off his rocker."
He's right. It's insane how long it's been since you've drank alcohol. This hasn't affected you in the least bit.
She looks down, then up again, almost angrily.
A matter of fact, really. The hunter has spotted the cocoon and is preparing to throw it into the ocean.
"I was meant to worry you. Please, just give me the feeling, Lieutenant."
Don't be so sure. He's *exactly* right -- the case files are overwhelming.
You're good. Just remember that half of what you're saying is *bad*.
"I have nothing, khm."
Your body aches from the cuts -- you should have done more. First helped her...
To make matters worse, the street grid appears to be missing its main artery, the main artery of Revachol. The detour has
Out comes another vial -- from the sock below. "Here you go -- *more* than half in there. Pretty impressive for such a small amount of material."
Your doubts are not directed against Cuno -- they at least *suggest* that Cuno could be culpable for the case.
As you tap on the gauge, the indicator pin jerks as if startled. It's not the hotel, or the coast... it's you. A dark figure in the green uniform...
"What did she say?"
"Do we have a... problem?"
She doesn't seem to understand the power play. The scene's gone. The power play was almost over a decade in the making.
"Okay." He takes a note. "I think we have that *skull thing* figured out. You don't want to get too entangled in that."
as you put your hand in the cloud. The sea air cools it down. You cool down.
The man nods. "Try the door. The one with the key. It's not too late. It's too late for *all* reasons..."
You're being *concealed* to her. You must have been spooked. Now come out -- you'll get the chance.
The archipelago is divided into three by the narrow shoreline, and by the crumbling piers that rose to the top -- LUM and WATER. The former two are mentioned as belonging to the umpteenth century, while the third is older than that.
We've arrived at a *weak* world, he thinks. This is our moment to shine! Show the world that a black hole doesn't rule!
The woods are alive with the sound of snapping jaws and teeth. A dark pool of warm green  lakes around a cadaverous stump of an old man wearing medieval armor.
Uh-huh, great. I already knew that -- if you didn't hand it over to the lieutenant, who's the *lawyer*?
She's still here, the primordial shit-stain. In your mind she's mostly gone, but she's not. There's something there, waiting.
"I want to put two and two together and find the gun that shot her."
"There was a holler somewhere over the river, we should check it out. It was a regular shotgun, how it was set up."
The girl's *statuette* speaks for her -- tall and slender, with large breasts and a dignified air about her.
Goddamn it, it's not like that at all!
Your heart burns with an indelible sadness.
In the Bodleian Library, a small wooden card falls into a small trash bin. When you rummage through it, you find a rusty old memory, a crushed amen. The sound of the file being pulled...
"Yeah, it's me. Man from Hjelmdall."
"She's in a coma! It *was* her..."
"A name I can remember."
"I'm great." She takes a drag.
No! Never! I have no need for *myself*. Give me room to ask. Where did you get it from, then?
"My..." he says, staring at the frostbite on his hand. "I don't know... I can't remember any of it."
Looking up she sees a grown man -- on the wrong side of forty, his face bloated from alcohol and god knows what else -- not that the wrinkles are surprising.
It's a *security blanket*... giving you and him a level of comfort and control you've never known existed.
It's not a façade, *bratan*. These people are not your fellow citizens. This is a façade that's been constructed in the shape of you.
You are interrupted by the dead body's cadaverine odour. The cadaver floats in front of you in the smoke-filled tent.
Boy, you really haven't given me a lot to work here. You should give something back to someone.
You should sing that sad song you were listening to last night... The shower vibes reminds you of that.
The coat hocks and warms you, its residual heat giving you the illusion of time of any remaining motion. You look at the form, then the man before you -- behind you, the corpse sticking out of the form, then the curve of the face, then the slit...
The Northlands are a confluence of two rivers: the Nachtherrer and the River Esperance. They merge into the Rhine at their source.
"What if I don't have to -- and you can't remember *anything*!"
The captain has fallen into drunken stupor. It's a losing battle...
The upper body and the lower extremities are coated with a waterproof polyester felt hat. The soles of the signature lorries' boots have been glued to the surface of the statue with adhesive tape.
"Oh. That." (Point to the skull with its spiral mouth. "That's exactly what you're looking for.")
A poor student who does not have the resources to complete her homework.
You think this may be the *legendary* Pizzicato Ruggiero...
All you hear is static, no one's saying anything. You can just feel the weight on your shoulder.
"I'm sorry, sir." She tries to smile.
You *can't* trust an old man with your health. Maybe he's being sarcastic...
Because it's *unusual*.
A metallic drawer slides out from the seat. It's empty.
"No, I'm not, I don't know *anything*. I am a*dopehead*, a contradiction in terms."
"Who am I then? All I do is think..."
Outside in the rain -- the ruins of a lost gun battle. Dust settles on the remains of an ancient fortification. The river Esperance sways in the distance...
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You can see yourself in it -- *
She shrugs, looking around. "Nothing to see here. It's a loop where there was once a trace of life before it..."
He ignores the hologram. "We should continue our search. Perhaps even get a little desperate..."
It's *totally* also your illness.
Try to imagine the blur moving in front of your eyes.
AORELA? Or is it RONNAULAH! It's always *orangerian*!*"
"This isn't theater. We're police."
The lieutenant stands there, dumbfounded. He's never going to believe it's a thing, but he will never forget it either.
Okay. Where was that kiss?!
Are you trying, Harry?
It feels *insane* to be haunted by an old ghost, doesn't it? The place you're in right now feels like a lost cause.
"What? Do you think I'm fuckin' brain-dead?" He scratches the back of his head. "Can you please shut the fuck up and let me have a drink?"
It's hard. To sit through the sweeter memory. To look at those nice abstract shapes. Getting *more* though, even...
It's a mystery, sire.
An unspeakably delicious combination of bitter and sweet nuts, rendered in amber by the electric pow... A little wheat-free, maybe?
"Yeah? Who's *my* husband?"
"Alright. What happened?"
When a police detective gets angry, he usually apologizes. Not this one, though. He just *stands* there. His fists clenched.
"No need for the hornet's nest." He picks up his pen. "This whole thing is about the importance of this one man, in your opinion. We can get more out of him. You could make an example out of him."
What you should do is go back to the pawnshop and pick out some more. Then go back to the pawnshop and talk to the salesman. He may know where you can get more.
"Racist remarks?"
Huh. So then you wouldn't be able to fly, only drive?
Say: "I told you -- she was leaving something, you didn't hear it. But I'm not going to hold it against her. It was the boss."
These people could be in for some major life-changing news. Don't let this *little shit* slide.
"So are you telling us that you *were* there?"
"Good morning. This is a regular morning. How can I help you?"
There was something in there. It's gone now.
"We both share the
"How do you know?"
That uniform will be the only photograph in your Life, he thinks. The man with the sunglasses will be the only other thing worth remembering.
Don't be silly, *bratan*. You can't tell the difference.
Yeah, yeah, we got it. Relax. We're not in a position to talk about *the other stuff* here. It's either your mommy or Garte -- probably the latter -- is the real expert. Go with it.
"Is this police business?"
She clearly enjoys this.
He nods. "Theoretically speaking, at least. Any hypothesis providing an extremely high degree of statistical agreement is automatically discounted..."
Sound logic, if not quite in your head yet. Yes, of course. And you've said *that* plenty of times.
(Hug the phasmid.)
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. Even when you're drunk. Drink 'em over, drink 'em dry.
In that case, a self-deprecating joke. The kid is using you for his own twisted entertainment.
They're talking about the scent and the taste of this building. This is a nice, classy place to stroll in.
He waves his hand, as though to dismiss the thought, then considers it. "No it's a good idea to keep that shit away from Annie."
No. *No* is not a consequence. The consequences are the ones you didn't count on. The mountain of them is what you should *not* count on.
Do you know what it is?
I will. This is one of the things I've been lacking...
All you hear is a series of clicks, then the change in volume, as the lieutenant moves his oil, audible above the tremolo.
There's more to the ledger's fate -- it was left in the broken box, with the knife, knife's edge, and the board beneath it all.
No, it's not that.
Something felt off about the way she talked about you... A guy she's been flirting with before?
This is not a place of the airy. This is the *other side* of the world -- with no atmosphere, just vast darkness shining from her eyes. The surface is  nothing but a pile of mess.
The dude may have extreme anxiety issues, but he's a model and a pretty good one at it.
Not holding his breath.
No, I'm not losing my nerve! No need to rock the boat, these *poachers* just want to shoot the messenger!
He nods. "Try."
Degenerates with an ethnostate ideology fighting an apocalyptic war on multiple fronts. World War III erupts, and the fate of Revachol is thrown into chaos by the Prussians, the northern half of the world's *moon of* petroleum.
He smirks. "Possible, but I have to say -- something smells really bad, and Cuno's not in a good mood lately."
Me? What do you want?
"He's just cold as fuck."
"The wounds were self-inflicted. It was all over -- the wound bed awaits further investigation..." He doesn't even bother looking at you.
"We checked the traps. Did you notice anything interesting?"
"Kim, who are you talking about?"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!"
"The next thing you need is a weapon."
So in Revachol there is a less visible form of the city, a ghost. This is the light we're looking for.
Under the pink morning sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from
A movement under the dry wind.
"I'm totally with you, lieutenant. You've got it under control. Look at that beauty!" He swallows. "I'm glad it detonated like it did. But I'm still gonna have to stuff it in there..."
But you can't stay awake all the time, can you? You'd collapse from exhaustion
The charts and diagrams follow. The book includes tables and instructions for running the experiments.
Your hands up.
The blurb reads: "When the Pox were still being bandaged, their tumours fell upon dead soldiers, so that the limp would continue to grow, until the soldier's bones broke... No...
Yeah, it was creepy. You can't say it's not.
"Damn it, the body can still fit in that thing..." (Turn to Gary.)
After a while, the young woman notices you staring at her with a mix of amusement and derision.
The kid smiles. "It feels like a compliment from that nameless bureaucrat. Well deserved, even. Just say what you will about the... "
A large metal pendant hangs from the rear view mirror.
"Are you aware that all evidence relating to the Union's *hunting* a low-level narcotics suspect
If you can't trust your own eyes, who can you really trust?
is what I need. I want *CSI* questions, man. COME ON -- I SAID "SEQUENCE".
"Yes, and -- let me think about it -- you were able to use it to blackmail the company into paying you this *monetary ransom*."
"I know what I did. I'm sorry."
"Yes. What is it like?"
It's not easy. You've got to be sensitive, still, and careful not to break the wax paper -- this is a delicate task, and you should do it without too much
He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "Yeah, so anyway -- some would say he's been softening up lately... Should we bring it up? Should we bring it up?"
You should ask him about the cold again.
I'm just having a little fun here.
"I do." Her finger fiddles with the crack at the end of the chaincutters.
"That's it, baby. That's all for the story."
Right -- no one in their right mind could *not* do that.
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The Man From Hjelmdall is a cursed soul. He tried to make amends by building a *reparations* wall, but couldn't. The most brutal of all...
You *get* me Cobo, man. I feel like you were once close to me myself. Like you used to lie there on the roof, with your eyes like an eye on a dog, sniffing the embers.
Interesting.
Look, there's *I Am Stuck on A Ghost Ship*.
This is still something of a let down -- you didn't even pursue it properly. Instead, you thought you were cool, but now you're sad. Sad because you didn't get that swishy-fingered stuff.
Oh, yeah... *big brother*. Like, brother, you and I are brother and shit. Just hope the *bad* don't track you down.
The bottles float in the still salty water. Some of them float on the surface of the water, turning brown...
"If we're doing our job it's very important to keep our eyes open."
That's dumb. Why'd you think
An old Bechtel 50 sounds itself to the side. It appears to be in constant motion.
You should also look into the blue eyes of L'Homme Autumnal, a supernatural entity with two thumbs up his nose.
"A lotta wild. Can't help but wonder."
You betcha! As long as you're both drunk you can have fun... until the very end, when you both go home and die.
"Okay, so if you don't have the key, how do you get in?"
One moment you're running like the wind, then you're standing in it... Hit the deck and try again, you dare not walk away with your pants down.
I'm already listening.
"You weren't even in school."
As that soft word passes through your mind, you rise -- into the apricot-coloured light of the window. Outside, the night has fallen on a large wooden structure, most likely a church.
You feel an unspeakably delicious aftertaste, and the pain and swelling in your mouth intensify into a sort of agony.
This was your gun. Yours -- and by extension -- the People's. It was shot into the air by
She's careful to say that she's not planning to get involved in the politics of this case, but her words have given The New something it can't quite place.
A scruffy-haired little boy stands in a tin shed on the outskirts of the village, holding an elongated stick insect.
"No," he takes off his glasses, cleans his face and then looks at you. "I'm not *that*. I'm Kras Mazov."
Oh no, they're both gone, dispersed through the air. The little sticks and branches. All you see is a broken ribcage and a bloody lip.
You've got to love the smell of liquor on your hands. This is one of the cards you should look into first.
He does *not* know that.
You're not going to win him over.
"Is it," he ponders, "like I can't do anything with the spirit bombs any more?"
That's a little too *disco* for you. You're not a great cop without this.
The first chapter of the *Insulindian Sea and the Boreal Nation* already takes you by surprise. This is good, because it gives you the index. The map is *annual*, it's accurate enough.
It doesn't look like there's much life in the dog's belly. It's empty and sad all of a sudden.
What an odd choice of words. Surely an athlete of the Revacholian high is not what you're looking for here.
It feels like the base ingredient was tin can -- the can is a military weapon.
Most are softcovers: serialized *fantastique* and detective stories from the twenties and thirties. This *special* book is especially notable for its cover: A four-legged biped with a skull and an Iilmaraan desert eagle enthralling in a midnight black heart!
"Oh my god, the Apollyon is going to hit the fan!"
What happened to us?
"You mean the other cop -- Titus Hardie
Is he insinuating that you *lacked* mental toughness?
Look at the clock.
What's going on here?
"Lieutenant, we need your badge." The lieutenant's gaze shifts from the pamphlets to you. "We have evidence to pass to your station, but we need to ask someone else. You *need* to be taken to the station for the results."
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember The Rite of Honour. It will always cleanse a man's soul...
Beneath the rum and the smokers
She's not afraid.
On the photo in your hands -- a blackened cheek, run over by a bullet. Lost cause, really, and the photo is still bothering *You* somehow.
The lieutenant takes out his notes. "Two things come to mind: one, we should probably stop trying to connect things, and two, maybe you could open your eyes and see for yourself..."
"Yes -- politics."
There was a touch of grief in her tone. A genuine sad one, the shards of glass breaking over the wind shifted around her face...
A sigh. She really didn't mean it.
"You would have to ask him."
What is it, a wolf? I can't hear you, the words are coming out, all on their own, going back in time...
He's thinking: "Sounds terrible, doesn't it? You don't want any untaxed sinners getting tangled up in your netting, are you?"
There's a pause. "I don't mean to be uncouth in your company, but... is this really *you*?"
"Hey, hey, hey. Should I get in there?"
"What if I don't have a..."
There's no denying it now. *The song* is pounding in your head like an old seagull, reminding thee of thyself. Then it's gone. Thine own voice sounds strangely on the airship. Then
Your hands feel sticky.
She's not the kind of person who likes to let things hang there
A pair of very large headphones pops into view. They're covered in static, making their earrings look even smaller on the head.
"Your father was a professional racer and a strong leader. His name was Vasilisa Andrejevic. When Vas was alive his brother Radu killed him in a freak accident. He was the worst thing that ever happened to him..."
Suddenly the man starts growling... A terrible, *giant** tongue seems to be licking at his cheek.
The mattress feels cold and soft. After a while, she decides it deserves a closer inspection.
The sheets are filthy and damp. The bed sags beneath your weight as you try to stretch them.
"Got it. Can I ask you something else? Do you have a *boule* now?"
Of course, it's a little pastel pink. Probably called "The Courier" -- maybe it was on loan from L'Homme?
A slick black cape dangles from his shoulders, and the man looks westward, over the sea. Old, at least in body and in soul.
If you read the second entry, you'll understand: The *zweihänders* were a race of tall, lanky men who liked to strut around in rags. Some time between 250 and 500 BC, a group of zweihänders decided that they didn't like tall, *Zweihänders being big and loud*.
What you're saying is: I'm bitter about the obvious answer.
He looks at you skeptically, "The hell are you talking about? You're a police officer, not a... nerd?"
It was his favourite part -- the struggle.
A service crate is a container of cargo stowed in the back of a vehicle for transportation between the logistics hub and the retail outlet.
It's okay, he's thinking. I got this. Find the gun that
It really is cold. Colder than the bowels of the ocean. You shudder.
Why, hello there. Soft spoken, yet *knowledgeable*. Go ahead, tell me the cold part is scary.
An embrace. You feeling this? You know of course you shouldn't lie to him about his armour. *You* are the one who did the telling.
You're absolutely beat. You're practically on drugs, sire. Alcohol has not been a factor in this event. But, you know, what do you do.
She laughs. "Yeah. Cuno's gonna wrap this up, pig. Cuno's gonna bail now."
"Good call, man. I think I know what it's like now. I think I've opened the door to some kinda hell."
At first the **honour* didn't seem to register, your tongue masticating like a chicken without its head. But a quick scan reveals that your A-game face has indeed been defaced.
Maybe you could open it?
All you need to do is read the fifth entry.
He could have easily said he was just passing through.
All this excitement *could* have something to do with the fact that your heart has just about burst out of your chest.
He points his gun at Elizabeth. "How about the kipt? Go ahead? Tell me about some asshole who owns a gun..."
Somewhere in Mirova a grey haired girl in her late teens or early twenties stands behind the counter of a clothing store. You see her in the flesh, her vibrant eyes fixed on the sale of some high-street brand.
"They all do," he agrees. "Always trying to shake things up
"You look so cool. So funny."
As the second smallest of the two remaining implosion models, the Wirrâl model is actually a rather simple one. It's been aptly named, in honour of its simple yet effective composition.
The former peace officers assess the situation in front of them.
(Smile.) "Thank you, sweetie."
A large, breathy man reaches into his sleeping bag and pulls out a large plastic bag containing a heavy fuel oil wrapper. He puts it back on the rail. "Here, have a look -- this will do the trick."
"I'm not sure I see the appeal in this, nor in your particular physical features."
"Why are you calling me a cocksucker?"
He's very animated all of a sudden. This sudden
A grand expanse of water reaches over the pale blue ocean and to the horizon's farthest reaches. Golden grey in the morning light...
"She only called after you *rescued* her from the horseshoe crab. The following morning, as you left, she called again..."
While the man stares at you, two men carry an overturned barrel through the snow. They seem to be examining it.
It's probably for the best. The lieutenant has to stay professional, even if he *knew* it *was for taking out Col Donohue.
"We should still check out the prints." (Conclude.)
Who said anything about cheating?
The light is off on the third floor of the Whirling-In-Rags. The young woman there is visibly disturbed by the revelation.
This big guy -- he's talking about an entire residential neighborhood being destroyed in a massive explosion.
A metallic drawer slides out from the seat behind the man. In it you see several drawers with a well-preserved, black lid.
He's trying to give you the *inside dope* -- the kind of dope that says: This one is in *prison*, walking in circles...
He nods approvingly. "I understand that it is very difficult to perform a field autopsy on someone who has just committed suicide."
Believe it.
She laughs, almost chattering. "Could you imagine? There's a worker and his toy sweeper?"
She's basically admitting to the murder.
Even Klaasje couldn't have guessed that the implicating information would end up on your lap.
The last of the great software companies, a self-confessed *homo software engineer*. During the Revolution it used to be called CONTEMPORAL PROD. Since the War begun the company has undergone several relocations and acquisitions, all of which have reduced its value significantly.
This is *not* about how the >whore* is connected to you.
Hands on the vest, eyes scanning the body: "Tattoos."
Not a lot, no.
There is a genuine sadness in that smile.
The lieutenant frowns. "Yes. That's all. We'll have to proceed with our present plans."
"Tell me something else."
"The Distant Past, Part 4: Hopes and Fears"
"In any case, I'm glad you understand what happened."
Get out of here. You can't even *think* about talking her out of it. She'll think you're stupid if she finds out.
He looks at you, eyes filled with profound empathy. "But you are the RCM," he says, taking out his notebook.
He coughs, then mumbles, still caught up in the moment. "I'm done with the fur coat now. Would you like some advice?"
He narrows his eyes. "That's... probably for the best. Anyway... *if* it *were* a game, Ruby would have won. But she *is* not a good player."
Her high-pitched voice doesn't sound like any normal human voice. It's almost like she's from another world.
Like a
As you already have no reason to lie, all this missing gun-nut nonsense doesn't do anything but piss him off.
Some guy walks up to you on the plaza mosaic and says: "Hey, Cuno's the biggest psycho in Revachol West. Cuno's got shoes too, though." You realize he *must* be getting somewhere. Whatever he is, this *is* a really bad idea...
Where night has fallen on the coast, in canals and on islands, like cast iron domes on a mesque hillside -- can you make out a *lonesome* place?
You have to stop him from going down. Not now. You have to turn the tables and get *Klaasje*!
D'you know what? It's probably too morbid to entertain in your own head any longer. Leave it at that.
"I have some questions about that."
The lieutenant nods. "That is a solid hypothesis, I'll consider it. Let's look at the tree." He points to the smaller one.
"How did you get around the Hjemdall?"
She's silent, her hands playing with her veil. No vapid representations of your penis have penetrated her silent and blissful spheres.
The lieutenant looks at you wearily. "Please let's not go through this again. Better to get back to the investigation."
Just like that it's happening -- the rhythmic beat of your brain tells you that *you're* insane, that you're about to blow your brains out.
Behold
Some *paranoid* hooliganism is the source of much discomfort for the Gaston-MacKenzie Corporation.
"Of course, I'm sorry to get all of a sudden into your *business class* details," he replies. "I will have a moment of contemplation. But let's begin with the important one first."
You should say: I'm satisfied.
Indeed. The boat comes closer; you can feel it slam into the back of the reeds. The wind howls over the Bay of Revachol.
It's the pantheon of Awakened Ones -- the living, the dead, and the future all lumped into one place. The single greatest in the history of churches, in a place called the Sister Panopticon.
"My dad's a big racist -- he thinks
She's wearing FALN 'officers' -- a specially made replica of the police weapon used by the RCM in Service of Man's Majesty.
The vibrant red of the Don Giovanni shines out, casting long shadows of his 'Man with Sunglasses'.
"I don't understand what you're saying, but this building is *ruined* and abandoned. It's a poor choice for a protest."
Do I have to say *what*?
"I wish I could have said it to you..."
I don't care.
Look in the window.
Blink, look! What you're doing is probably illegal. Be careful now, don't *scare* yourself.
"And? Does he have a problem with her?"
There is *no* logic to your bizarre thinking. If there ever was one, it must have left a little echo in your head somewhere.
She doesn't look or sound human, let alone *addicted to crime*. Where's the fifth Hardie?
There's something there. She has that bloodstained face and that burned into her forehead.
Yes. You should go back and ask the kids. There might be something they could teach you about sound effects.
In those movies, Zsiemsk -- these people *deserve* to die.
"'Til we get a chance to talk.' (Stand your ground.)
That's him hiding his real name from you. And you from Cuno. And Revachol too, from the GRI. You should just say Cuno.
Coalition aerostatics hang like apparitions under the cloud cover. Hovercraft lower than the clouds hover above you.
Don't be silly, Jean. It's not a lot. It doesn't even have to be that big, it can be small!
"God damn it, it's *teary* out there."
Well... you could *do* it. You just won't look *cool* any more. And you won't be able to do it *funny*...
The Task Force arrives.
"Well, the cops have all been in and out of the Whirling's cells, so it's probably best they know what the king is up to. But yeah, I can't say if it's really my visage."
"What about the Whirling?"
"Yeah, you haven't been seeing him because you have a
Unbelievable... you get the sense she might have said something to hasten her own collapse. But you're too *dumb* to notice it...
He blows a steady stream of smoke. "This was the only way she could have gotten the gun. We'll have to keep her from that."
You see signs of decomposition on the plaster, visible from the blockage's submersion into the sea.
And an old serviceman talking to his friend.
The abrasive ends of his razor-sharpie cut into the flesh around your thigh and buttocks. The melodrama ensconced in gold and yellow continues on it's own, long journey into the ether.
"Yeah. I'm not wearing either jacket."
"Hard- core guys like no one. They think they know everything. The police isn't really their area of expertise."
"Klaasje? She sounds like... a little girl -- maybe 12. I thought you guys were supposed to be doing something useful."
A flash of pain interrupts your thought, making you grimace. Then it is over.
He nods. "The strike began in *December* and ended in *January*. At the end of the strike, the workers declared their intention to self-annul the lease and to build a public works contract with the city."
"I'm not even sure if this is the case here, but I
All you see is the smelly lump of plastic there -- a riff-raffoo called "The Don". It looks like his nose -- flower-like,
Where have you gone?
You may be able to collect extra cash by selling some of the cheap gear.
Your hand is tired from holding the backpack. The beat on the coffin lid grows cold. You think you hear something...
"Fuck me!"
Some disinformation. He used to work for Pleasure Arno
A loincloth is a cape worn underneath the raincoat, usually covering the entire body.
It was not clear whether the lieutenant saw it. He didn't.
"Right. Let's talk about it."
There's nothing like the sound of a speck of dust fluttering in the wind. The speck spills out into the open air, before the *trial* begins.
The Wayfarer Act is a law designed to prevent information from leaking to the media of the corporation that runs the station.
*Something cracks*? You hear a piece of broken glass and a yelp from a poor woman across the yard. The wind picks up, the woman scrambles back inside. She takes off her coat.
There must be another way. You could run around the coast and find a way to the mainland... though that would mean admitting you lost your legs!
"I don't even know what that means."
The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "In the event that the headless FALN Rider is not located, is it?"
He would be eternally grateful to have that gun back on his belt right now -- or *anyone* for that matter...
For what? A trillion?
"...and then  I put my hand down, it's not pretty, but..." She pauses, thinking.
He does *not* understand the severity of the situation.
Your fists tremble. Every now and then -- when you're feeling insecure or *neglected*, as you usually are -- you just pull on those rotten old pants.
SONG -- THAT ONE. IT'S IN THE HEAD. IN THE MIDST OF THE NIGHT YOU RECENTLY COMPLETED A SIMPLE MOTOR CARRY.
The terrible *sense* you got there. The *in* there is something otherworldly and special, as well.
"What were you up to, sweetie? What *hobby* did you want to do?"
"Aye, I guess you just got a little carried away there. *Aye*." He chuckles nervously. "I suppose you're not totally insane, detective. Anyway -- you should move -- it's cold outside."
He tries not to look at you. "Hm, that stuff... I'm not a lot of fans of old newspapers. I don't even like the little magazines with old newspapers inside. They don't look nice on me."
That's a bummer. To be honest, it's kind of sad that no one, not even you, is here to
As he spoke, she looked at you, a little startled.
"I don't have time for questions right now." [Leave.]
"__clarification:</|puttingyourhandinyourpaw</|"__comment:</|"__nominal:</|"__virtuous:</|"__honest:</|"__shorthand:</|"__psychic:</|"__races:</|"__stratos":</|..............."Fun."
"There is no need to apologise." He's still smiling his beloved grin. "You could try *there*, once you get the chance. There are many ways to approach the door -- some are more pleasant than others..."
To the west, two figures in flying saucers compete for supremacy over a single city block, each with their own telephone number.
The billowing cargo crane now towering above you, you would think this bunker to be nothing more than a glorified storage shed.
Is it a wonder, or an embarrassment, that so many people are calling you? It's hard to say. It's like calling a duck a quack...
"So she's not from around here?"
"What do you mean?"
Annette's Social Worker rat pack shares little in common with the RCM's own rat pack, being stuck with the tiny stick insect instead.
She'll be back. She knows her scent.
Time to nab him by the pussy-knife, it's your fate to *capture* him!
"Okay, baby, I won't do it again."
"Thank you
Keep them from going out at night. Don't let them get too drunk. And don't let them get themselves high on heroine either.
"No-no, no-no-no," the middle-aged man with sunglasses hisses through his clenched teeth. "Right this fuck off."
They're closed. You will get them open one by one. If you have to resort to violence -- and you WILL use violence -- then so be it.
Then she hands it back to you. "You should. It's a pinball machine -- it only spits out balls."
"The answer is no."
"Right." He nods knowingly. "Welcome to reality, to me at least."
"Which one do you mean, mister?"
Don't even try to resist.
Well, then maybe this is why Evrart is such a *big* jerk -- and the rainbows and elixirs he drinks? The alcohol, it's almost *
"That's right, pig, all you need is more hip hop."
You attempt to focus on something distant and abstract, but there's an abrupt change in the subject matter, and he interjects: "Don't talk about cop shit, talk about real life shit."
You received a small, dubious electrical token from the vending machine. What's going on here?
If they're so *desperate* to end their lives, why didn't they consult you? Surely it's something else...
The girl's going to be *thanked* right out of this one, Harry-boy. It'll be *so* good...
He was just there to support you. Nothing more to do.
"He's much better off here. Just waiting out the storm for now..." He looks around.
The sign says: "Boy, you failed the least cooperative shopper in town. You'll never know who it was if you don't mail the body."
There's just a hint of  subtlety to his finality. He's waiting for it to come to him, the finality of the deed.
You are all you need now.
No. I want to see what happens when I try to come up with my own conclusions. This is my chance to set my own agenda.
"Okay, but..." The lieutenant almost does not stand in the view window, but is forced to do so by the smell. He does not have time to stand or even walk.
"I'm sorry, sir. I wasn't trying to be funny. What I was trying to say is -- are you having trouble remembering things?"
"They all get sticks and shit. When they're young they pretend they're ministers, faking it. Then they pretend they're cops -- pretending to be clergymen. Then they pretend to be rock stars
Titus -- behind the main entrance -- had some *discipline* in the matter. Titus is a *big* man and understands the military.
Go ahead then. The rest will follow, faster than you can say *even more*.
The man holds the purple envelope. "It's from her. From the day I took her to the police station. I never thought I would see her again..."
Look to the sea...
This half-done mediocrity was what he needed to connect with you. He'd managed to connect with you, and with *him*.
She was about to launch into an impassioned description, but interrupted herself. She wants you to focus on the beer.
"Okay, Cuno's seen that shit before."
You read it. The quickness of the glance, the doubting gaze, the mock umbrage... you will be ridiculed for it. Yet a mile away from here, you feel the least discomfort. Most of the people in this corner of the world would never judge a book by its cover. You would be the first one to do so, perhaps...
You, a guy on a panel, in front of 10 people, some of whom are *disappointed* in you -- you sound almost semi-conscious, don't you? All because you said something along the lines of *I'm done thinking about this*.
"Anodic music is not *outdated* in any way."
You got it, pig.
Look at it, you know, objectively.
More than that.
Open your eyes and you'll see it's *banana peel* moment! Look at Kim first -- he knows of the ball and its sticky shenanigans.
The four lacquers are marked with a blue pencil. They come from the right side of the panel.
If this man's repeated delivery is any indication, the deceased *sold* his body into this hell. He says he was going to show it off -- on the beach, in a *show* situation.
You can barely hear the beat throbbing in your ears. In the distance the radio hums -- a rusty old beauty rock station.
He looks at you strangely. "I didn't mean to worry you like that."
A giant electric mammal awakens. The dead body is going to be... hard to wake someone from a thousand years of slumber.
The cabinet has barely begun to cool off.
It's not. It's awful and it's still there. You've just forgotten it's existence.
What if... what if there is a fourth Hardie?
He nods. "Please... take me off now..."
Next to stacks of bills, you see a few dozen stamps. Add stamp #1 to the end of the number and it's a total of three signatures.
He looks at the ruined wall. "Don't build *away* from this. Listen inside
What the fuck is wrong with you? Are you a school nurse or a cop? Are you a *MOTHER*, please, get in your head and let's go?
This is a flimsy case, but this lone man seems to be a good lead.
The dream is over. You had a *real* shotgun, remember? Could it be the one used in the murder?
Because you *have* to.
"Well, we're looking at a hole in the wall here, aren't we? I mean a hole in the world. The real us."
"Do I?" The lieutenant taps on the side of his head.
You... you don't even have a question yet.
There is a cluster of shattered windows above you, obscured by the city. Even those that are obscured have been looted,
Yes. You should. And it's probably better than sitting here. You have an *opportunity* to do some
A great buzz of wind passes you as you look ahead, and the stacks of Not Or Dead hero cards remain untouched...
The footsteps that you hear from the stairs are thin and cold. They're not supposed to sound similar, but they do...
"I'm the luckiest guy on the face of this Earth, but I can't just drop everything and go hang out with Claire. *You* should go for it, buy him some cigarettes."
The bed is comforting, especially after a grim night of drinking. You're going to need to lie down more.
She doesn't reply, her eyes closed and brows knitted in a state of deep focus, one hand cupping the headphone.
"I'm not going to help you, he said. He's not our friend. He's a criminal. A *kleptomanic*."
Yes, I'm thinking I see a type...
The spinner shine so bright they reflect on the lieutenant's glasses. He doesn't say anything either.
But he *lost* them. How is that so hard to understand? People go through difficult times, even in the face of death.
I smell weakness, and scheming. I should discard this weakness and concentrate on demonstrating how *strong* I am!
A cold wonder... When your joints start moving,
Your heart has finally given up on the rum run-around. The high has worn off, it's a relic, no longer than a minuscule part of you.
The lieutenant is not giving up. This looks very bad indeed.
You know what this case calls for? A *police detective* just might be able to take care of it.
I should go.
He considers this for a moment. "Maybe. Yes. Most likely. We just don't know when..." He pauses. "For now."
"Let's turn the volume down then," the lieutenant says, still trying to steady his breathing apparatus.
A chill comes over you, crawling down your back. The sand somewhere in the far future...
There are so many it's hard to count. More than 150, maybe even 175, leaflets drop by drop into the motor carriage as the honeymoon heat dissipates.
A long time ago a girl in a straw hat lay dying on the ground, in the pale, covered in thousands of flowers.
Then you should run for it, rascal! As soon as the basinside closes in the sky, the shrieks will cease.
You place the rare cigar in the small bowl. It has touched your hand, but not enough to smoke it.
This guy's got Authority off the charts. If he wasn't in your life you would have killed him. But he isn't and he doesn't care.
There is no *downside*. Death does not care about anything you've said or done. And, most importantly, you've already *drowned* this tiny speck of sun in a past life. No amount of *paint* can wipe that shit away.
You and him are destined for a similar fate. Perhaps even the same case.
Forget it.
Yes, all that remains is to collect...
"*Well*. We tried to talk her out of it
"In your defence -- I've done plenty of lapses in judgement."
It'll be all of them. In fact, it'll be *most* of them. As it should be. The details are important.
"Thought so, detective."
"Yes. On the outside, all of Martinaise is running wild with wealth and happiness, but one thing is for sure -- Revachol has always seen itself as something of a soul."
Maybe you should drop it. It's *unnatural* for you to be interested in what's underneath.
A wooden box-shaped figurine lies on the table between you and the phasmid. It is almost translucent, like some kind of snowflake.
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this day and age, of all times. People will be thinking of you.
It's definitely a lot of lapses in judgement. As you step away the misty
I'm pretty sure I can't smell it.
Wait, was Kim here? I should ask him about the evidence.
"Mullen -- yeah. He's a bit of a slut, but
Keep it together, no need to judge. You could argue that you *have* to be present for it -- to make it official.
"Are you sure I'm okay, Kim?"
"And now the mystery has deepened -- further complications may arise. I must do my utmost to keep this boardwalk in tact."
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermennokr trees surround a road that runs for half a kilometre. The sea is cold and there is no road...
The young woman has arranged for the general election of a sealed document to take place in the Union's sole trading hall. The Union may be the world's largest political party, but it is not 'large enough' for all of Martinaise to hold its secretee.
The tracksuited man stares at you int
That's *quite* ridiculous.
That's not possible, she's right here. That beautiful word has never fully left your mind, though it may have been in the past.
A little *is* what they needed. It would have been clever if you had used a prybar.
I know you're in a hurry, but you should sing this, right here, in your head. TAKE IT FROM THE PIG.
He's about to snap out of it. A bitter, bitter smile, a ready smile, a bitter smile... It's going to take a punch, just punch his sucker. Get it together, man.
"You can say what you want, I don't hold a candle to you. It's as if you were a *real* police officer." He looks you over, a little unsure of himself now.
(Pretend you found the gun.)
How it comes together is up to you. It could be an organic part of the airship, or a mechanical connect-in bolted on top of it. Either way, it's definitely not a regular *footprint*.
Thou art but a lowly dirt bike courier with shitty tyres. Not a star enough to sign up for a night on the town. Not even a *noble* sky.
"What are we talking about? Is it just an eye-gaze?"
Some other people have told their stories in the light of this old Chaotic Engine. It has also, perhaps inadvertently, fuelled some of the more bizarre notions of the wild night.
Your fist bounces off the door and comes back to you on a wave of agony that surges up your arm...
"Yes, it's a kipt. Well, except for the fact that they all seem to be very powerful."
Yes. According to the legend, there has been a riot at the innossence's residence. Rumours go around the lodge, the innossence's relatives have been fighting for days. It's quite unlikely that it's *on* now...
He points to Titus. "You remember, I'm guessing, Etienne, right?" He waits for the others to speak up.
Shit 'some gimps' left behind. Come back later, maybe we can talk about the weird video rental thing.
The young woman starts laughing, very loudly. When she stops, she immediately starts again: "I think he's holding a grudge against his friend for
Maybe it's good
I don't wanna look at this.
The cover features a charming illustration depicting a solitary individual reclining on a bed. A close-canopy view of her face dominates the illustration.
It's definitely some other guy. Or god forbid, some kind of weird game. Play it cool.
She's a murder victim.
"Okay. Let's keep the cockatiels."
"Damn, they're in the wrong order." He fixes his eyes on you. "As the insignia of the Revachol Citizen's Militia. I changed the name to reflect my current rank, officer. It's..." He falls silent.
Bystanders reported unusual flying saucers in the sky -- triangles of smoke rising from a set of antennae. Scanning instruments were raised to intercept the signals, but they failed.
He does not seem bothered by the stares.
He turns to you. "IMPOTENT SUBJECT OF POP CULTURE, I TAKE PITY ON YOU. YOU CLEARLY WANT TO ENTER THE HARBOUR BAD -- LIKE A LITTLE BOY ON A LETTER. I CANNOT LET YOU ENTER THE PAST."
"FOUR SEASONS WERE EXPLODED ON YOUR RACE AND THRONE. THE THICK DRUM OF THE LAMB OF THE GREAT RACE."
"You can't show people the bullet. It's impossible."
"Yeah, I'd love to know. You ever been in a firefight?"
"It could be any of these: Saddleback; the remains of an Army barracks on Boogie Street -- four story mausoleums blasted to smithereens during the Revolution. Demolished in '08. Demolished in '08. We're talking about... *Stratosphere* stuff here. Rotten ****. Terror."
He's right. They look skeletal. And so are their digits.
"So you've got *no* memory of running away or hiding,
She looks sad, eyes receding. Then she looks up, her face impassive, and says, "I'm not sure I can trust your memory..."
It feels to him as if you just *defeated* an enormous opponent -- and this man has not been trained for combat in a combat zone.
"Ah, so there is, yes. A sign of the times..." She rolls her eyes. "I'm not wearing this out here, is I? I'm out."
"By 'rhinossein' you mean me?"
This door is guarded by an unusually bulky anti-theft device.
"Pigs wanna see one another die. See how it's done."
The coil is glued to the
Manipulated his feelings.
It seems unlikely that two humans would get along. Still, you have to question the lorryman -- you *have* to.
A glance at the woman.
"Kim, how did you get inside? The thing is, we all have a tendency to overdo it in life and at times the excesses... I'm sure you're well within your rights. I'm just saying that sometimes it's good to temper your life-expectations with a little reality."
"I can see," the lieutenant steps in to relieve you. "The rest of the building is caught up in this jam. Don't worry, you can still come to the harbour, but you're *prohibiting* the part you want to cross."
There was a curveball there -- hidden. For some reason, it's in there.
He says it like it's obviously obvious. Like he's said it a million times -- to himself.
And when your facial expressions become more human, more *likable*?
He doesn't actually think it's funny.
That's right. It's the frame you're looking for.
As she turns back to the wreckage she sees a strange man in a police uniform standing on a bridge, surrounded by police dogs.
You should look at the distribution of hats in the camp -- which, let's be honest, isn't that surprising given the subject matter.
He nods. "As I said
She doesn't sound too thrilled to be talking about what came after the battle -- and maybe from this guy as well.
"*architect*... *architect* implies *creative*."
A better approach would be to get the girl to say the thing she said before. Then ask what she thinks.
"Of course -- your shirt." The blonde pats his P238Z-coated service revolver on the floor. "Proper *retard* style."
Your words echo in the karaoke mic, ringing against the wet floor tiles.
"How do you think he said those things?"
But it *is* a big bonus, isn't it?
Steady breathing, solid core. You're in.
It seems that even at this distance the amateur photographer can discern a distinctive black sphere, slightly smaller than a potato.
"I think we have arrived at a solution here, Harry."
What did it mean to you
"I wouldn't have said that. Tell me something else."
You see a monochrome blob of meat hanging from the other side of the branch. It's almost touching, like a hand has reached deep into the flesh.
You feel different. You no longer feel like either one of these things -- you are no longer a man accustomed to feeling emotions.
"Do you want to bet?"
He's a lifetime ex-militant now, slowly turning the corner...
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
It's time to crack this case. The next logical move is to visit the old haunts of the gang, at Le Cycle's northeastmost tip.
"I don't know
"Good. We should go and mail it then."
With a loud thud the old man stands up -- tenses up, ready for the fight -- only to see it's the pistol round about mid-sentence.
Seems like some sort of steel safety hazard indicator bulb was installed into the wrong place. Care to try again?
"I think that's a reasonable sum."
They still are -- almost exactly the same size as the one you found. Even the thumbtacks are the same!
There is absolutely no need for such pathetic displays. Retaliate immediately.
"And what do you think?" He looks you over. "What kind of a mister would you say this to your kids? Do you think you could justify this conduct with the kind of kids you are?"
"Fine." He concedes. "But do you have a tape?"
This was his bad-ass clothes guy. You should have *killed* him in a sword fight
The hand of a *scamp*.
He frowns. "Maybe it's your case files, or maybe your case files are bad ass and this shit's all they have. Either way, we should at
Inside the temple, the heat is seeping down on you. Your eyes are closing. You hear that? The scariest man alive is wandering the streets of Revachol -- alone and suspicious. He is as alone as you are in this...
These guys are too scared to talk about their bodies. They should be more scared of you, *officer*.
Wait, no! There was a *duck diving* in that creek! You know what that means -- an airplane crash in the night.
(Look at the coins around the table.)
Patience. After the combat, after the *stabbing* -- and after living through war -- Patience is the most precious of all.
"If you look at the headlines of the *last* week -- this seems like a very serious incident."
Tribunal? What tribunal?
"What *are* we doing? Why do you have all this time to spare? You're a busy man, get off this case. This is boring!"
Your hand moves on the lock... the brass handle slides over the surface of the pin and into the little slot.
You're supposed to be *the Law*.
All of this built around a love that transcended race relations.
Just remember -- when you go to war, both parties commit atrocities. Everyone is a *bureaucrat*.
"Uh huh." She wipes her nose. "I guess I've already started to think about it. Or did. I'm not sure."
Honey, I'm always up to see the flowers.
No, I'll never stop, I've told myself that song, I'll never break, I'll *not* do it. You lied to me, and you'll never find the truth here.
There is no salvation...
The man shakes his head in response: "I'm used to that... You should have seen her too, if you asked more closely. The wind gets pretty hysterical up there."
Am I going to be a...
"After all we've been through -- how can you stand here?" The lieutenant frowns, shaking his head. "It's tough to say, officer, but maybe you should talk to me about the library card... I don't want to take it up any higher than necessary."
"Okay, that's it then." (Conclude.)
Uh huh, *so* what? Aye something? You *do* know racking up speed can give you *credibility* in court, right?
A flicker of light on the night-time horizon. A faint meteor shower breaking the virescent horizon. It sweeps over the sky like a fine summer's day.
The papers still rattle inside the box... what's going on with *that guy*.
As the old man turns to you: "Good for questioning, rookie. The *Ice Bear Pub Crawl" begins!"The Bear Crawl" is actually a song performed on-air by a local station. But who's to say it *exists*?
You suck a minuscule drop of highly concentrated chemical solution into your hand. The solution begins to bubble to the surface, colourless liquid rushes out as you rub the sweat off.
Maybe it's the hangover talking? Maybe it's the hangover *buying* the pants? Either way, it seems like theres something in him.
A strong, yet... unintelligible voice comes from the back: "Your Majesty, we've been ordered to 'cure' you."
There's *something* there -- but it's being squelched. No idea what it is. It's unlike the heat-resistant material in his face.
After what must have been two seconds of silence, she speaks. "Besides, I *really* need to concentrate on what she said. After she finished, I went to the library and back again -- this is all very confusing.
He reaches out to get your hand. There's a gap.
It was something he'd wanted to do for quite some time. He wasn't going to let you stop.
Say it.
Your fingers crawl across the console. This is
Your hand shakes, holding on to the phial of pyrholidon. It's pretty safe to say you've *hit a nerve* here.
Her face darkens. "Doesn't even look like *me* in the picture. Look at the big dick on that shit."
"I didn't know it was a crackhead..."
In a matter of days, the war has become your *discipline*.
This isn't *just* a photograph either. It's a *feint*. Hold on! Maybe it's meant as an omen...
What was that about *not liking* rock music? You need to find out what *YOU* think this
Underneath it all the songwriter has written a powerful note. One that speaks to the heart of every true heart -- to live on forever.
Don't move your hand.
With a *crack* you could probably get one of those too. Something to keep in mind when the time comes...
"Okay, I'm not interested."
They must mean a human being. On the islet? In there. Tall, lanky and cloaked in a strange way.
"*The Dying*"? Why would she be so *mysterious*? I've seen suspicious things... but nothing like this.
Kras Mazov, the lead
Your muscles are in pain and you feel nauseas, as well as a slight burning sensation on your lower stomach. But whatever you do, don't say the first thing.
The beauty is in the unexpected harmony of all the improbable variations.
Hmm, what are the facts?
The salt water reflects off the aluminium foil in a beautiful spectrum. You see disco balls glitter on the wings.
"It's what the Waifs need -- more pain than pleasure
They're *pouring* something on you. The liquid is warm, like a julep from a good old-fashioned flask.
My goodness. Look at him raise his beer! He looks like a kid, a regular high school kid. Not some cerebral surgeon or something. But he *is*.
All of this taken from him -- all of this preparation work he did for you -- he gave you the hat, the cigarette, the carabiner. If he didn't, he would not have kept them...
"I found you a new *batiste* phone book, ma'am."
"I'd say you do. So I suppose it is." He crosses his arms. "Who else do you have here?"
"Seriously. I am not sure where it came from. There was a big racket coming from the building's chimney. Booms in the distance, I think. It was for taking down the Insulindian Citizen's Militia."
"Yes, well..." He closes his eyes, visibly dejected. "This old chandelier was part of the Roonie Jean's display, as far as I could see. It was supposed to look *good* after the death of the actress. I believe it was the disco who *liked* it the most..."
Then your stridulations cease to be melodic and instead you find yourself tangled in high-concept non-place names: Hyperborea, Islet Bight, the uninhabited isola of LUM, the islet Iilmaraan isola. Even the spelling is mangled.
There -- behind those little books, there is a little stick insect, crawling slowly, its legs spread.
No. You're right. We're all here.
There's always a mysterious *other-wordly* presence in the woods, he thinks. Somewhere in the confusion the bus stop...
His gloved hand is trying to grasp the handle -- all the while the other hand is squeezing through pain.
I *feel* very differently about this. The sky is vast and the cosmos is made up of more than the simple counting of atoms.
The old man looks at his rifle in the sand and sighs: "Can't we just keep it back on our shoulders? Seriously, this isn't important any more."
"So that's how it went..." He turns to face the sea. "So, did I?"
The boy's face lights up like a kid lighting up his dad's old flask -- it's almost too funny.
"Was it *you* that you said you're from Revachol?"
Solving your *rum problems*? Sucks.
You've gone over the man's body in the Atlantic cold and in the Pacific hot springs. You've also crossed the great islet, where you first felt it...
Touch it with your finger, gently
Can't talk, can't write, can't pay rent, can't even *join* this *boîte d'argent* -- you broke your arm trying to punch a hole in it.
Well, alright then, you can't really argue with that. *The Wompty-Dompty-Dom Centre* for the Arts!
"Yeah... it is. There's something about the nostalgic feeling of the, uhm, *nation*," he mumbles, seemingly in awe of his own self-regard. "I don't think there's much left. It's all gone."
At the end of the day, your best bet is to just try to *keep* them off the streets -- by flattery and persuasion.
On the coast of an uninhabited archipelago, where only animals had roamed before. In the wild reeds.
"I... don't know."
"Goddamnit, the show you're about to do! That's the *Show* of Death all over again! Let's talk about ______! Fucking cop shows!"
Close your eyes and imagine the best glass on Earth -- the stuff of *real* art.
Because this is no ordinary *room*.
He's doing you a solid. If anything, he's judging you based on the amount of speed you can manage in the short-term.
Hold on! Did *your* tits pop out?
The map comes to you in a sudden flash. The so called *freezing rain'' melts in your hand.
I know, I know... You're doing it. The numbers seem to sum to you, though it's impossible to *understand* what they mean.
In the salon -- the fat man has a massive aneurism and needs help. The bullet hole he felled is both grotesquely ugly and incredibly rare in Islam.
"Yes -- you. He's like you or me."
As if someone left out all the *kitchen tissue* tip-toeing around.
Here's some *hip* that *might* help you crack this case. Grab a hand-off
I can be a *shark cop*.
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see your face, such as it is without *The Expression*. It's just hairy.
You gesture for the elderly Saskantar singer to stop.
What is there to do now? You'll just have to hope Evrart hasn't sent anyone to his funeral yet.
The lieutenant's right -- all those corners, hiding behind those blind alleys. You should get your focus on the data.
The sun swallows the sea. There it is. Tequila Sunset.
(Take off your glasses.)
"Okay, but what's the *right* way around a book cover?"
He gave you a stern, *judgmental* look that made it all the more obvious he didn't want to be associated with you -- on *any* level.
For a moment the woman on the boat appears to be watching you. She tilts her head to the side, then abruptly turns away...
"Alright, enough. Why not?"
Look at her: teeth like pearls, face like a pebble -- how does a *thing* with two nostrils and a tongue? What is she hiding?
While he stands in the rain, surrounded by the wreckage of his friends' labour...
"I think you should let them work. Let them sleep in their own fucking lorry."
I smell old blood in the river..."
She looks you in the eye impassively, making it clear that you're not planning to take the accusation lying too personally.
"The song we came up with was very small and spontaneous. It was a joke or an idea or a feeling. It's the rest of your life I'm interested in looking at."
The propeller blade splits into two, ailerons. One is leaving, going *down*. The other is right behind...
It's hard to see it, but the carabineer does look old -- a bit like a *shadow*.
You try to imagine the man on the photo's cover, with the sunglasses and his passion -- only half-jokingly. He's
A scrawny old man sits on a concrete slab of a boardwalk, holding a piece of broken-down cardboard. A faded newspaper clippings
Across the water: Sacajawea, on the tiny isola of Martinaise. An article from the 78th (I think). It's about a ...
"Murderers."
An emergency valve defect resulted in steam pressure blowing the turbine, taking the fuel containment vessel up in the explosion. This resulted in an uncontrolled release of natural gas, and the flooding of the city.
Sure, why be interested in this world. Get back to the streets and chase that scent around? Hint: it's not there.
That *is* what the Coppuccino Personum suggested. A little joke, but still makes you squint your eyes...
Keep at it for a bit longer -- this has got him *boreal* now. You're about to snap your fingers in his sweaty little hand.
It *does* feel good to be the cop. The cop thing has really helped you deal with some tough decisions lately.
It *must* be. When you have a bullet, a case solved. The defendant must have a *bullet* in his chamber at the last second!
I understand, your mood is messed up. Hopefully, this plan will bring a quick end to your problems.
Looks like there's something *me* -- a cold streak has flashed through him, his gaze fixed on the cars on the horizon.
You feel something. A sensation, like molten chocolate rising to the surface of your stomach. Then it's gone... still too late.
At the bottom of the sea, an eight by ten meter buoy lies in the water. Its two remaining booms sound like an explosion. A little flame snuffs out the wind.
"A (small*) spear-throwing affliction that plagues the land. Stepping outside in the dark like that..."
It would certainly make the city more liveable. It would also make it easier to navigate, actually.
This is the Tien-En conflict, but it's not really about that. You probably don't need to be interested in *that*.
All right. You ready?
Everything you grabbed from her is perfectly in order, now turn to the morgue.
Chemical hangover aside... this stuff is really helping me with concentration.
Fucking hell.
"How would you do?"
"Maybe. You know -- in the most boring district. In Jamrock."
It's too late for anaphylactic shock. You've already done your body's defense mechanism. Now it's time to talk about the good things
"No, you're right. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that."
She's been to the Whirling.
"Even though you tried to fucking fucking KILL me, I just *refused* you."
No, I think this is a real heart attack... Don't go to the emergency room, it'll be fatal.
What can I do?
"I feel as though we have already met the others."
"This is of no consequence to me, it's a sign of weakness."
Plaisance is probably the most frequently encountered of the species in Revachol. Its members range from *little shit* to *large shit*.
Semen sample acquisition.
It's gotta be one of the central tenets of this religion for the crew to stumble upon it. Like some kind of a**hole.
"Hello, Officer...
He's assuming it's obvious to him that the basket is empty.
He *is* joking.
I don't seem to have any problems with this.
"Awww. No. I am what I am."
"I just can't... wait, let's turn the music down... Let's get a drink, Harry." He is halfway undressing you when the lieutenant interrupts you: "Did you want something to drink?"
She shrugs. "You're right. Maybe we should have invited her. The club was full. Even without her, it would have been... different."
It also happens to be one of the most popular tracks on the coast, despite its poor quality.
Fuck it. Just say *no* to everything.
As the last of the Tenant-Raised RMC's go out the door, the Memory Lane Commission agrees to extend the lease for a year to coincide with their midnight re-spinneret.
"Shoot, pig. Right down the middle. Right in the piggies."
It's almost as if she's intending to expose you for the slime-covered snowflake beneath the mask.
When you get the time you could go back in time and talk to the other drivers, see what they have to say about the ticket... But that'd be EXTREMELY HARD.
"There's no denying it. She's irrepressibly beautiful. A real treasure. One day we will meet again, Harry -- ask me one of these questions, or you'll wake up in a different body."
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but I don't think you're equipped to handle this -- at least not in *good* shape. Probably worse.
But it would have to be *bad*. People are going to die.
The grassy knoll is drawn out in front of the church. The wind crawls under your worn-down vest and lets slip some gore-strewn velvet.
This is your gun. Yours -- and in the future. You own it. But as of right now, you're stuck having a little talk with Garte.
"No one is, pig." He grins. "I'm just sad to see one of your personal fancies go in the shit bin."
Don't be ridiculous, of course not. I already told you, *no one* has any idea what you're looking for
Just stand there in that hulking heap of flesh, silently, and hope he has the camera rolling.
Come on, this is *not* your fault! You were young, stupid, and on drugs -- it could have been anything.
"Titus did," she hisses. "Titus doesn't have any **** to give these *fucks*!"
They're mostly red now -- some with the city's logo in
Glen --> Glen
Your teeth chatter as the snow melts on your exposed skin. You shiver, and the city shivers with you.
He thinks it's gross that you didn't tell her you worked for the Union... but maybe it's something he won't understand? Don't worry, he'll sympathize.
As if he didn't even like it.
"I don't understand." She backs away from you, still shaking her head. "I don't understand what you're saying."
She hasn't had time to put her make-up on -- the beauty of her 'Deora' mask has not failed her. If anything, it's made her even *more*woman. *More*proud.
"Is this your partner, Mr Dros
Too dramatic. Do you want *more*?
"And that's it? That's all you said is..."
"How did I get there? What's that connected thing in the sea?"
The guy on the video-camera shrugs.
The lieutenant was born to solve problems. He can't *not* be a cop.
She sounds like she's about to cry out of disappointment at your decision.
He looks to the door with derision. "And you think that's the fault of those wilde-beests? Come on, let's try this again later, maybe it'll calm him down."
Your breath stings, in the morning light, on the slabs of rock before you. No one sees you trying to perform.
Watching her warily, the lieutenant begins to suspect your lungs might be malfunctioning.
He points to Kim. "And he's..." he blinks, looking around. Then he mumbles something, then straightens his back.
The opposite of swamped.
"Uh... I dunno, man. Seems like the scabs would have started molting in the water lock down there, you
"We could just ask him to sign the document."
Gosh, the propellers.
Yes. Of course -- the world would be incomplete without it. To know that place... and know that name...
The dragon keeps staring at you. You've really let yourself go -- too late to back off now.
"That's right, people," the other one nods, making quick time with his beer.
FISH TOTALLY KILLS ITTY BASTARD!
"That's very sad, sweetie. We should just say it was *firework*. Now."
"Yeah, maybe he is."
But you're not a drug addict, are you?
"No." (Nod.) "No way in hell I'm doing it."
You had your chance, Harry-boy, but you missed it. Made you look *crazy*. What happened, where did you go?
She keeps her eyes on something on the sea ice... the *other* shore. She hasn't been paying attention to anything you've said.
She says it matter-of-factly and with a hint of... annoyance. Like a child who's tired of being told what to do.
The kid looks at you incredulously. "You think the insides of those helmets are... different?"
Those thoughts remain somewhere in your dead angle, masked by the violent colours of super-smo. A major artery of Revachol is impassable.
"No." He stops abruptly. "That's not part of the discussion."
"Are you saying you were on the balcony when it happened?"
Because I don't want to let Kim down.
Strips of polymer fabric, mostly humanoids, all wrapped in a cheap light blue plastic. These posters are barely holding their own in the face of death -- and a whole slew of boring, predictable cardboard cutters.
It's like he's said a thousand things. The closer he gets to the end of the conversation, the more questions he has...
"*I* would rather you just went and told me that..." The carabineer frowns, his eyes distant. "That there was an *act* here, rather than keep insisting that you didn't know."
Strange, you seem to be ahead of *everyone* on this... intellectual front.
What if the signal intelligence interceptor has fallen into the sea?
"Lilienne said I was a bad influence on her. She thought I'd gone straight *and now* she has *stepped in*."
He sees it: you, the dented mug, the old man slumped on the table. This is the *Kjøttkkär* he mentioned -- the one he beat his wife. It's a murder weapon, maybe he's lying...
She nods knowingly. "What I meant to say was that we should take all possible routes into this building, just in case."
He means it. The millimetre is an artistic statement.
"There's no need to *lie*. The whole situation is a misunderstanding and you *witnessed* the entire thing."
"What's his name?"
"That's the spirit!"
"He *solved* everything."
In the distance, the sounds of the harbour are deafening. But you hear the lieutenant say something: "There has been a report of someone carrying a weapon near the Whirling-In-Rags."
Move the water bucket towards the washing bucket. There is a dead body in the container.
"No," she replies quickly. "He never was his *boule*."
His friends will never forgive you.
The lieutenant nods. "And you should be grateful. Not only for what you've already discovered, but also for the things you'll find when you get to the island..."
They don't want to talk about it. That's *their* business. Besides, they *do* have super weird things to say about *things*.
Nothing to do with this right now, (*blank*)
But it isn't.
I'm sorry this didn't do anything... usually hurting yourself does something for your mood.
"Well, you know..." He thinks for a moment. "I don't want to be an accomplice. I'd like to talk about something else, but... we don't have to do it now. We are *unintelligible*."
You're right. Why should we just leave and move on?
Yes. The spooky shipwreck that you were told about *hailing postcards* from. It's not happening. The world is not ending, everyone is going to die.
The boy dances on the gloved chest of the dead man. The dance ends with the kebab-eating tongue of the victim swallowing the corpse. The ocean of the dead man's face appears far away...
Cocaine? Cocainum? Sounds like our kind of king. And -- just imagine -- what kind of cocaine a user would have!
He looks you straight into eye. "You're a fucking *little* bit racist. And you're right, I shouldn't keep doing this."
The storm, what misery!
Please don't let him talk you out of it. He *will* talk you out of it, but he will need your help *somehow*.
Why would anyone want to leave a game over a guy who found out a girl was being played by a *ball'?
This would have been good at getting those father figures to talk to you. Now, if you were to make your own contribution...
A tear drips from the corner of her eye. "I know, officer." She quickly looks away.
"I doubt that, ma'am."
This isn't important right now. Focus on her.
Alexandros Vassilopoulos -- a.k.a. the Justicier -- sat on the commission for two years, much to the pleasure of his political rival, Zeloxes. The Just
Don't look at her -- let her be.
comes alive. Tiny particles are being pushed into the white noise by the strong magnetic field of the battery.
He sighs. "I was naive. I didn't understand how important this was. This *shitstorm* will never end. It's a shame we have to lose this one."
A bitter cringe. The lieutenant looks at the corpse as a ball of fire, a lonely ball of defiance with one bullet in his mouth.
end of every line?
By your side, Erwin keeps his steed stowed away discreetly. The scene is too hazardous to intrude on.
"The kids, the man... the fucking meter maid, and... the Doomed Commercial Area. I don't want to get involved in any of
Well, if you say it's for the *good of the team* it really isn't. The lieutenant is protecting *himself* from an unpleasant situation.
What the fuck is happening here?
You just take them off and put them on the ground. It won't hurt now.
You felt like you were ready for anything, but you were wrong. There's an expression called *on the lips* and it applies when the lips of a man and a woman form an oath, not that she'll ever enforce it *outside*..
"Wait, that's *not* how *money* works!"
And drink *that* too...
"Thanks, I have a cigarette every time I walk in the room."
Why are you even still reading this garbage? Elliot and I are barely keeping you together here -- nowhere near good enough! Besides, the story is *not* compelling enough to *rig* the system. You'll never convince the system twice!
"Right, that settles it."
You jam the cutters right under the knot -- that's the *meatiest* one. Gets *any* problem right under your nose, gets your life under control. You don't need a gun.
You *get* that feeling, right? Cold wind, abstract shapes... you get the feeling you should have been there -- you should have gotten a drink, but you didn't. So anyway, you see the lieutenant approach.
The old woman is ready to sob again. She looks so ugly and so old. Her short hair is matted with grey.
Once more you hear that his voice is uneven, some parts are on the strong side and others on the *modulator* -- note how it's placed. This was probably done to make it sound as if there is more than *one* here.
"Yeah, they're wild -- a giant bug in all the reeds! But we can't stop them. Not in Martinaise."
"No -- I'm an underground king. A people's king. Like the people of Mundi -- I'm supposed to keep things in."
"Oh, let's take another look at that old cradle that's ours now." The boy turns to the woman, smiling...
The giant Ptolemaios cannon tower rises above the city, casting shadows cast from its epic cannons.
Dodged the bullet there. For a moment it seemed as though he were just *talking* about the corpse.
"Are you ready to dance?"
Never forget: anyone can join. Just ask for a *name*.
No. People don't *like* music. Most people would rather have a cigarette than listen to any of it
Back to the container.
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. Yet another land mass swallowed up in madness...
"I knew it! I knew you couldn't shoot!" He claps his hands. "YOU CAN'T!"
"I don't really know. You have to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very careful. You might break something."
You know what this *intellectual* guy thinks he's being compared to a moribund cement mixer? Fine. It's not a game.
Not we, I'm not running this town. [Discard thought.]
"Hmm, let's talk about something else for a moment."
Sound Analysis
"Forget it. They all are. Enough."
That may be the machine's core, a distant memory, but it speaks to the movement of the molecules
His big grin speaks volumes: "I don't know. I just followed the lead of one of the most persnickety little *phasees* -- that's *it*."
"A sigh of relief," the lieutenant says with a wide smile. "We're done talking here. Now about something else
You're right, lovely *cocaine orange* socks will make for an *extremely* flammable pair of boots.
Another memory. You remember her... she was a friend.
There is a contrast between the modern office furniture and the wooden furniture of yore. The former seem to be in pristine condition, whilst the latter seem to be worn and patched together in a mad attempt to look 'senior'.
"You sound angry."
"You don't have *that* energy." He shakes his head. "What the fuck do you want with it?"
You think you hear a *man's* voice in the background, but what you're really hearing is a great &5! At least half the background part is lost in the explosion...
He looks at the blue heart-shaped cap. "...Who'd have thought? I don't think we should..."
And a little something else, too. Smoking on the coast of the Martinaise Inlet, between towering tower blocks... smells of tuna sandwiches, seaweed salad, and sweat. Whiskey orange, maybe? But you're too *old* for that...
Yes, your brain does *have* sent you to the library, to look at those scary bookcases. And you've stopped, sad-boy. Now, the time has come to *unplug* him.
"Don't worry, it's probably just a coincidence. I'm sure there's nothing to be worried about."
This little sticker is *unused* when you first sit in it.
"I'm still not sure it's a good idea, detective. I don't know where you got that outfit in the first place -- I can't have it in my personal life."
"I see. Okay, let's move on!"
"The repeater dish is currently unavailable. I'll contact the Station when it's available again. Should you need further assistance, we're standing by."
"Wait -- who are *you*?"
Saw Gerome at the gates.
"Oh no -- it was nothing."
I'm getting suspicious. Maybe this cop thing is too big for you? You should rethink it.
"What if I already have *one* copy of the map of Martinaise?"
In this scene, the Headless FALN Rider is in the line of fire. As soon as the shot *opens* it's eye, you know what to do -- you close the book and do it.
He taps on the cold metal with his thumb. "Or we could abort this mission and return later. Just knock on the door."
You may be more surprised than you think, but alcohol doesn't have *anyone* to drink with, does it?
"How do we make this part of the grand routine you're initiating?"
I'm a *bad* cop, it's just that.
Take it back.
With a muffled gurgle, your nostrils take in the air around you. Then a great plume of smoke erupts from the gun's mouth -- a flaming fuse snuffed out on
An entirely new world.
The lieutenant looks on, somewhat bemused.
"But -- where do you get the engine, and how do you get inside?"
"Yes, go ahead. You don't have to start *it* over again."
Gone. Gone is the glorious *Speedball*. Instead, we're left with a rusty fan, a connector rod, and a pretty face.
Wait, the how did *Iilmaraan desert wind desert get its name?* Surely this can't be the *real* name of the place...
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
If she's planning on sticking with you, you *better* get everything prepared for that eventuality.
"I'm actually thinking of doing one now."
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Look at that tiny smirk he gives you! Look, he *pretends* it's not there. He's lying!
Feel free to add a *maybe* to the list. It's implied. You might be wrong.
Wait, you can teleport?
"A very simple theorem. All that remains is to show that there are no correct answers."
"Fine, let's do this some more.
It's also got a lot of things missing that you didn't notice. Like a dodo.
Garte, the Cryptofascist
"Told you it wasn't hard core."
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this situation the lieutenant is the *only* one qualified to make a statement like this.
"Why do you say that? We're in Martinaise and it's a shithole."
"How do they know we're cops?"
Almost there. A chipped yellow sticker serves as the bottom of the hive -- you just need to dig into it.
Her face flushes with embarrassment. "No, I don't think so. But I guess it doesn't matter either..."
Yes. But this is such a waste of time. You should have known it. Just ask her about the time vortex. She'll give you a second chance.
Took the case.
There's a hint of *sad* in her voice. Like she's trying to cheer you up. Or if she's trying to cheer you up, she probably shouldn't have.
The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "Perhaps it is appropriate to add that you had your fill of *lies*, didn't you?"
A blanket that's been around your neck since you were a kid? This is an actual product from times gone by.
The deserter has confessed, after much wrangling. It's your duty as a cop to bring him to heel.
"A character in a play I'm writing."
Look for: Precinct 57 -> About -> What -> Where -> How -> How -> What -> How -> When -> How -> How -> Who -> When I can't remember the last time..
Of course, not a real corpse. Whatever you think of the tent, you have to admit, it's pretty impressive.
The presence is relieved.
"I'm glad you're alright,
People are kind to you, even when you're criticizing them. You just need to be more forceful in future.
She means Ruby.
He doesn't know what that means. Talking about *parallel processing* wasn't talking about putting the chaps in a single day.
I don't need to ask anyone any more.
This is a minor discovery. Go ahead and give it a try, even if it fails...
The other toy nods.
Great!
--Gone--THE GREAT EMPTORIC REMOVAL--he thinks, the file should go with him. But he *lost* it...
"Then let's go and get the water lock open!" [Leave.]
Yes! You seized it, the crown of the world, and now it's going to hurt your neck -- *drouin* -- BOUGHT IT ON THE MARKET. WHERE HAS IT GOT TO?
Someone's pissed because you wasted your time getting this far. Now they want to move on.
You're so old, Harry. To be honest, you're surprised at how well it's all worked out so far.
Wow! All the time. You gotta show those dudes you've got a heart, cause otherwise they're gonna shoot themselves with it.
Shoot, Loonie Roonie!
Oh, yeah. Bottle opens on you. You could drink from that. Bottle's *open*. Bottle's *cocktail* could be just as good. Either way, you'd feel incredibly stupid not having had a sip of that weird stuff.
Wait, wasn't the Promethean donning his armour, and his battleship, and his banner, and his *Gooning* him?!
Your knee feels uncomfortable... there's an old speck of steel under there... maybe you could get it to stop spinning...
But you're not a regular worker. You're a regular person under the influence of powerful neighbours, who might be after the *wrong* thing.
All you hear is silence, as he waits for your response.
A moment of silence. The video rental turns off the machine and the faucet disappears under the lid.
"A commando's high of choice. It's for the entertainment of her, not the protection of her country."
A very small race of flying people -- called a flyers -- live in the clouds above the city. They glide over the water without so much as a single syllable.
This is both a tragedy and a blunder. Because of her. Because of the debt you've made. She'll never forgive you.
The fluid spills out of your mouth and onto the floor. It's then re-dissolved in your throat, into odour and colour.
There is *no* passion there. She has said it before -- and she will say it again -- and she will ever again.
He frowns. "When you say *one* thing it really *enshralls* you. The most important thing is -- what's the story?"
"And who should we then talk to?"
You never had a chance. There was something off the moment you approached it... It was scared of you. Of you alone...
As you look at the broken tool, the ANTIQUE BOY thinks about how hard these guys work.
You hold the lapis lazuli -- an angular metallic fork held in place by rivets. It strikes fear into your bosom.
We had our 'F' -- for fuck's sake! The 'Funk' was a bit too strong for our liking, but the 'Funk' was a 'safe space' in the first place. People go there when they get scared, not as a destination; see if you can ride the wave of its 'pale'.
Look him in the eye.
His strained features remains in the icy distance. Those hoodoos still a distant menace to all who hear, yet seem so very long ago.
Okay. You're really bad.
"I didn't know I had to deal with her."
The Pox is too incensed by your unprofessionalism to acknowledge the injustice of the situation.
The hand is surprisingly stable in the chair... until you start banging your head against the table.
But, in your case,  the head is your body, the neck the canvas you've soaked in... it's elastic.
The lieutenant is silent as a corpse.
Focused on completion. Missalogical. It's the sound you made when you were drunk. Thinking of it now, do you think that went off like...
"There will be another time." (Opt in.)
"He's... uhm... a *killer* cop, huh? He's really good." The man leans closer, giving you a curious look.
Perhaps it's puerile? An exaggerated physical expression.
He does *not* actually look like the man in the lies. He almost looks like a *scary* sauer -- less human.
An ominous presence is growing within the half lit room... The wind ruffles some papers in a filing cabinet.
What do you think you are, a super-detective? You're just trying to do your job, right? Wrong guy already blamed you.
Even more naked men. Try as you might, you can't quite see the flesh sticking out. It's  just  the flesh, everywhere.
It says: all major routes have been closed off. The capital is where all the money is. If Kim is to continue the investigation, he'll need a small army of agents in Värtna.
He sits on the edge of his bed, contemplating them. "My hammock, is it a... hmm... kojkoa? I don't know... I don't remember well..."
Allum remembering this one naughty-boy.
"He means the Union. They take care of things in Martinaise."
"The only thing you're not is sober, Lieutenant."
Your mirror-brain is still firing off messages in the dark, confused as to what the hell you just said.
Is it? For a moment you doubt it's really your name. But then you guess so anyway. Who's to say.
The big guy takes the newscharm and shakes it in your face: "And *what*? We don't do tricks. Not on you, Harry."
"I'll keep calling you Klaasje."
But she has already placed her order.
Go ahead, try something!
"On the contrary, it is impossible to overestimate the importance of *herila's* murder weapon."
He bites his lip. "You're right, you're a drag. I won't be there for you, however bad you try to make yourself look -- I'll be extra careful."
There's no way to hear your breathing. Only that of the air inlet.
No, the corpse isn't moving. You're too *bored* to try and fiddle with it any further. The corpse is dead, that's all.
The trap is full of them. Silvery and green between their fingers.
"Good," the lieutenant marks, writing.
"I did not know that was even possible."
"It was nothing." He shakes his head. "Nothing, näkk-ling. Nothing! It was just a foolish hope, and I'm sorry I ever had it in me. Now..." He looks down at the ruined
"Okay." She takes out her paper and pens and paper balls
He's not okay with that, and doesn't plan to get along with you any better -- at least not any cops.
"Kiki, kiki," the little one asks after the others have left.
It's a mystery. How can it be? It's like someone left out all the *the time*. Why is that? Don't ask -- later.
"*Now*."
"Why is this so complex?"
The wind blows. The silence. The water gleams like a blade.
"What was that, officer?" The man looks over his shoulder.
You're very dangerous, *bratan*. Dangerous, even, at 37,000 ft. Above even the pilots.
The landscape around you shakes as the titanic strugglers make their way through the reeds...
No, you're going to blow. You need to get *high* and feel *wonderful*. Before you go to sleep. And now.
Nothing is unimportant, Sam Bo. Close your eyes and dreamt of the thundering soundtrack you heard earlier.
(OH MY GOD!)
He *is* suspicious, yes. Believers in Dolores Dei -- the innocence of humanism -- would do well to heed his warning.
Those words ring through your mind as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass.
There is something *so* vague about it. You feel like there's no *thing* here.
The pole has been carefully cut, the wiring runneth deep. The crew must have gathered in preparation.
All right! Let's consider the //facts* here. The bullet hole in Filippe's heart must be a fact.
The man in the portrait is imagining it. He's not a Burnt-Out Saviour, the way Kuuno could write that sentence.
You were a sad drunk who bought an ugly tie
He's here to catch a murderer.
If it comes off *right* it will be the last thing he does after this ugly mess.
"What about the boot size?"
She mumbles some kind of a reaction, but it's in her spent deep voice. It's not like she's surprised.
[$basement@do_you_kidding]],
Something keeps shifting in your vision: She's looking out the window, then the wall of the freight container, then at you. Then back to her...
"Is it? Oh no..." She bites her lip: "You're totally calling me *surprised* to hear that! Are you saying you're *not* surprised?"
"I don't really need that many toys for myself, it seems. Besides, how would my kid ever hurt that big toy again?"
And it's not even *safe* for him. It's not even *safe* for him to lie to you like that. You don't wanna to be in a place *where people see you*, do you?
"Don't ever ask me again."
Dedicated player. I know you're heart broken you lost it. But keep at it. You can't let the World's Most Suited Man drink from your flask.
Try the 'pig'.
That's actually not what I'm looking for, I just need an answer to one simple question.
The shape of a rock in the stratum processor is somewhat evident. A huge skull is perfectly symmetrical. The subject of copigrine doesn't seem like the kind of person who would want it.
In another world, a wall with a wall of books.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the add
"...try to find *an*arc for the program."
He touches the stinking corpse. "Look, I'm not gonna start *any more* murders, Harry. There's no need for it. At this point, it's probably safer that way."
You could try launching a *trade war* to crush the lieutenant's economy, or you could blow all that money on a *public education system* for your worker tokens...
"What I'm hearing is: he's
You're a total *psycopath*, he thinks -- which is ironic, seeing as how he's been trying to improve your moral fibre.
"Why did you write them all down then?"
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see the reflection of your face in it -- such as it is without *The Expression*. It's *just* a regular old face with a pimple.
"Doesn't matter. What matters is, that *pyrosopherist* is bringing his bath of *psychedelic* fumes to us."
She wants you to help her with something, but she doesn't want to flinch -- her life may depend on it. You shouldn't ask him anything else.
I am?
The *torque conundrum* was a code-word for an electromagnetic resonance imaging machine (with torsion coils) that could pick locks. The device was used to open the door...
She thinks it was a good metaphor. It so eloquently captures the essence of the dilemma you're in.
She is uncharacteristically quiet in the face of danger. Even in the face of death. Maybe it's worth standing up for your gun?
Fuck 'em, but don't *get* over it! Don't ever give up. Be stubborn as steel and come back with a *better* question.
Nothing is done about that.
He sees it. You can almost taste the carabineer's teeth as they chitin the jaw, trying to keep your balance...
"He just sleeps in the filthy room after the war. Always there's a fight to break. He's a fighter, after all. And this fight has only just begun."
Something's amiss, the light in the room has shifted. You hear a resonant *click* downstairs...
There's a little pause -- he gives you a look, not quite sure what to make of it.
"Ha, ha, yes." He continues laughing. "People in Martinaise make the connection to *Silent Spring* -- it's where the name is from."
Like fireworks.
'Yes, this is quite possibly a super secret location. Let's not give it away.'...'If it's him...'...'You look down.
There is no one here. There is no time to waste on this. You need to ask her about the needle NOW.
"Can you tell me any *ladylike* things about yourself? I mean, you're obviously a legend around here."
He shakes his head. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- I have no idea what this stuff even entails..."
What are you talking about -- pull your head out of the balloon first. You can't let this dude keep pushing the envelope.
Let him choose.
Wait, what about the other bikes?
There's a touch of something between his lips. Like two little birds sharing a shell shell of a sandwich. And
What was that about *poison*? You didn't say it was healthy...
You know, in the middle of all this commotion a very bothered and shaken driver appeared before you. He looked very confused. He didn't know what to say either.
He looks down. "Unfortunately I don't have to say any more. This is all speculation. Please proceed with your investigation."
Things really *went downhill* from there. He was too busy concentrating on the thought of the moment to notice the gap.
Like a small bird, it slowly - imperceptibly -- takes its wing. Then it makes itself at home again, leaving you cold...
"I don't know..." she looks around, shaking her head. "The people around here... I think they're all dead. They probably made the people at the church look worse than they actually were."
It's *everyone else* fault if I don't live up to my end of the bargain.
"Yeah. This is what the world wants."
In the inner sanctum of his mind there is nothing but darkness, no darkness... It's as if someone defecating right into your ear.
Yes! Though it's not usually so, but here you go: *Pheromones* *Magic*. *Knows you*. *Can't stand* the man with the sunglasses.
"I don't think he appreciates you meddling with the church."
Deneuve En Sabour, the most famous living person in japan, loves music. She spins records on a reel to
"God, I was a borscht - almost on the floor... when it happened. Well, we should have just asked him."
A familiar tremble, like your knuckles scratching against each other, as you approach the man by the window. It's very clear, you think -- but you don't want to make it sound like you *piss* -- or that anything bad has happened...
A curious emotional resonance. She means it.
The great district hums in the wind: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron. To Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the brown horizon...
"Why did he do it?"
"Don't know," he says. "What I know is -- he's made his way to the boat's stern. Wiggling. Or maybe crawling -- I'm not sure -- but he's a particular mystery -- something I've yet to piece together."
Come on. What are you waiting for? Ask about the stall! Maybe you should come back if you learn something relevant.
I'm sorry. (Told you to shut up and not say it.)
"Anyway, I need to talk to you about her..." He sounds annoyed now. "I didn't want to bother you with this, but the lieutenant just shot my gun down."
Somewhere on the edge of the island a Pleiades outdated automobile spawns with the words "Pleiades" emblazoned on the roof. In the East a Pleiades old-fashioned auto rims the streets. A Pleiades bookstore opens
In your hand you hold two different carsabins: a handsome red one and a drab cobalt blue one.
He might be, but that doesn't mean it's not *there*.
The carabineer stares at you, silent and brooding in his sleep. No one has noticed his trepidation.
She's not. It's impossible to hear a word she say. You are simply focused on the present moment of her utterance.
(Shake it, like you did last time.)
She's too worn to even *lie* -- it's the deep tendons and all.
PUSH THE BUTTON -- I DON'T HAVE MY GUN!
"*I* think I already did. You know the expression 'It can't be that bad?' Well, it could be..."
You're in. The light is here. You can feel it -- the mason jar lid has opened.
The two of you? In the middle of nowhere? Far away? Yet here you go, talking about the *bad guys*.
Your opinion of this case is too hazy to concentrate on right now. Focus on what you CAN focus on.
"Okay. How about the guitar? I was hoping that would play some modulating sound in the machine."
The weapon is set on a rack and its sights set on your chest. There's a magazine in the pistol's grip.
Something in you wants to immediately *forget* about that. As if it never happened. You may have really just said it...
Ssssssssire, you could learn more about the courier's identity through this *investigation*.
"It's a great idea for the Union. We can build some momentum and get more people buying our wares."
He's ranting about the Union Boss and blames the booth. It's pointless, he thinks, as it *never* does anything.
"That's it, then."
"This *doesn't* add up."
The man stares at the chipped grey stone etched into the granite. "You need these slides if you want the ghost to speak."
Didn't say anything.
Oh, *bratan*, you played the old man like a three-string banjo. He's stupid, but he has to obey the rules.
"What a bunch of fucks..." The man with sunglasses shakes his head. "What a bunch of *moribund* fucks you got on your team. Come to think of it, I don't have much to add to your complaint list -- besides the fact that you get *so* little, Harry."
No. Not quite. The rhythm is off. Not quite. Still, the punctuation marks are *exactly* what you're looking for.
COLLAPSING TENEMENTS This one has the most important of these tabs to himself. At last count he was *sitting* in 106th place!
Isn't it enough that you've talked with her?
"The pawnshop is open!" He fiddles with his pendant.
Whatever you're planning to do with this stupid phial of booze, you need to do it. You need to express yourself.
You! You and the seagull are just alike!
Some specks of dust shimmer in a faint beam of daylight falling from the window. Other than that, the room is dark.
You see the stage set up for the gathering. The giant screens are filled with static, emanating from the living room, where Lely has his giant Ferrule mechanical pencil.
Of all the things to be stuck looping it's *too* funny. Do we really need to be in this damn chair? You need to get out.
There is *no* shame in admitting the bullet was empty.
"If I may add, it appears you have it in your hands."
Punch some holes in his skull.
Then some. Better not to rush it.
"What do you mean by *cold-blooded*?"
As you're turning away from the gloom, the machine seems to be turning on a small source of light. A filament moves in the end of its cable, casting shadows on the door...
"About the science officer..."
The call to arms, he thinks, is unfounded. Perhaps we should just proceed with the suspicion that followed the first...
The glass under the yellow-painted roofing material is frosty from the wind. A few coins and a mysterious little glimmer of a stamp...
She doesn't seem to notice them. If anything, she sounds a little relieved they're gone.
The word lingers in the air of the yard, as far away dogs are barking and residents are leaving their homes for work.
You should get the hell out of here before you get hooked on this sissy detective story.
"Does it happen to be that the
Ow.
"Now you see how this works," he says, turning to you. "Do as you're told and I'll give you the item."
The broken toolbox lies face-down on the floor of the toolbox. The tools lie scattered around, scattered like locusts.
Don't... Don't talk to *Garte*. Keep your nose out of this *sensitive* business. You'll never know what they'll do to her if they know you worked with the SPECTRE.
"Yes -- and do let us know if you have any further questions. Kind regards, Cinderellis Dei."
"Aye, so here you are. It's late and the sun is going down. You should pack something light."
He shakes his head. "I have to say, Klaasje was quite stern about the body count. I wouldn't expect her to run a small neighborhood watch club."
"...in fact, this cell is the last thing we have left to do."
Too chaotic. Your mind is a chaotic place and you're not recognizing some of the things you see. The rifle is raised, pointed at his skull.
The courier shudders and looks down at its note. The corpse looks right next to the book.
Soona, the Cryptofascist
Great news.
Noid cranes his head up.
Wait... what if Kim is the architect?
A crumbling staircase winds its way down to the basement, filled with abandoned shafts and dead ends. An old shaft, used to store meteorite samples, still rumbles with activity.
There seems to be a *chaincutters* attachment. It seems like it may be missing the attached p
That's a 77 which means speed -- in minutes, it will be *all* over. The moment has arrived.
"I'm pretty sure I want to know what I'm doing
Your heart beats twice.
The gun, the only thing you have, the one you pulled the trigger on. The only thing you've *got* is your feet and your heart, which is a drug. But a good one. There's a silencing effect.
Your hand reaches deep into darkness under your clothes... You have no idea where to begin.
You hear that? The lieutenant keeps his usual stern expression while you casually mention the dead man's name.
You take the note. The faintest of sounds. "Pig," you hear it.
I really want to be able to cope with *no one*.
Those animals go to the Bronx Zoo.
Your hand shakes, blood is being pushed to your brow. You're sweating profusely.
"It was on the internet."
What a down-on-your-luck hero. You think it's appropriate to wear these rather than sleazy cop shoes.
They have not ruled him out.
"It's unfortunate -- we're just trying to do our job here. But as you can see, it's no joke. There's nothing else to do here -- not for the company, not for Revachol."
Should we ever face a totally unrealistic scenario like this, you would make a much more convincing hooker, *officer*.
She nods. "They were all crazy, but they believed in something -- in each other. That's who they were. If they didn't, they wouldn't have gone."
The creaks and groans around the door are obviously his. He's trying not to show them off too much.
You picture a cardboard cutout of a street grid before, right in the heart of the heartland -- with the exception of the A streets, which are not really marked at all. The RCM has never been to these places.
Oh no, those were quick, those were fun, that was a bad idea. You should have pulled over before.)
This is a very old toothbrush. The borscht was boiled. A toothbrush is impossible without a good bain...
"It's been good talking to you, sir, ma'am. I hope it's also been *wise* of you not to reveal yourself to me."
Because you're a better man.
You have no idea what it means, but the lieutenant seems to agree. He gives you a meaningful nod.
He nods. "Yeah, I understand. Let's keep it that way -- we'll have to deal with the boy ourselves, at least."
There's not much to say now, if you ask him. Even his eyes are slanted, the lashes framing his face.
He grimaces. "Maybe you should slow down, c'mon. Who knows what shit you'll find there..."
How is this not a *big deal*? Lest you think I'm some kind of a*priest*. Please, just trust me.
"Okay. What is it?"
"You're under arrest for the murder of my beloved Anne Le Thau. I'll punish you for this, one of the following nights I'll take you in for a *gander*, payable in blood alcohol concentration... Aye, it's certainly not the first such incident I'm aware of..."
Yes. Before you went to the seaside, there was a *grand strategy* hatched in your head. The squid's *plastic* might be able to help, but it's in a worse state now...
"Oh yeah... she does look like a professional negotiator. Little red phone -- there's a little sticker on it."
This is the *Vesper-Messina* motor carriage.
I knew it. I knew it!
Nope.
But all that's left is that broken pipe, just waiting for you to drag it up to the curb.
It's all very strange.
He stares at the dry grass, then at the branch in your hand. "So, you *could* buy some drugs. Seems like the only ones left are the outlawed
As you stare at the virtual wall, the store windows proudly displaying their wares, the young man spots a cigar puffing away at the back of his hand.
You're not imagining it. They would have to have a search warrant to enter here.
"Okay, so Kim is very good. The ***** knows his lines. Tell him."
Sure, why be interested in the world around us. It's not important.
Well, not thinking of drinking, the strong, insatiable beverage. But it's not *just* any beverage, it is a sacrament, a holy mystery distilled from the leaves of the sacred sacrament oak. Until you find the one you were hoping for...
Don't take it personally. Everyone has their little idiosyncrasies
He gives a flat no. "What am I supposed to do about it? Ask? Let me know, I'll do my best to assist whatever you need."
"And the man they hanged was named Filippe III, because it was the first major company I ever met..."
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was an economist and theoretical historian. He was a leading figure in the Graad side of the Turn of the Century Revolution, where he headed the Nine Day Government. Mazov is considered the father of scientific communism (mazovian thought or mazovianism).
The bay is littered with crumpled up vehicles waiting to be towed away. You see trucks full of ice cream and other sundae-related items.
It's a small thing, but it's *stolen* from a collection of Man from Hjelmdallers, written by Karl Shakowski in Mein Kampf. You can't make it up, he's not the one taking the form of someone who's sleeping with his own partner.
You were a fool to think there's anything interesting about that jacket. Why not just buy some jeans?
"There's something *more* than that."
You stare into your beer. Two cool bottles slowly pour out of it. It's incredible how long you've been staring, just staring...
"This doesn't change nothing! It's just my radar! Anyway, did you have any *interesting* things to say?"
"Yes -- if you don't see any suspicious activity. I'll call you in." He grabs his leg and shakes.
"I'm getting it -- it's just that you're not sure what this person is, but you could use a friend for a friend."
"You didn't hear me." He listens intently.
Just like that... a breeze of pain passes through your mind, pulsating through your entire body. Time to face it head on -- *knowing* the plan.
It's the only home you have now. Whatever else you have to do, make up for it.
"The machine isn't working. It's too big for the black jack with the pipes. This was a terrible idea."
The dicemaker nods at you, his voice carried on the airship's co-axial. "I'm not surprised it's not operable," he says.
Now you're in a mess. Maybe you shouldn't rush head-first into a store that seems downright full.
"Okay. Let's take a day off." (Look at the clock.)
Everything's okay, he thinks -- he just hasn't figured out how it happened yet. In the meantime, though, you've got to stay on this ship
The lieutenant looks at his notes and nods.
"Would you like to see me shave?"
"I do." (Give up.)
Now it's just you and the seagull -- against all of Mundi, even -- against the winds of Giuseppe. All of us.
"Right, I'll stick with the old one."
She says it as if she's ashamed she broke the news to you. That she does not want your brother to feel left out.
What's next?
Wait, did she just imply that you're *bad at this stuff*? You should ask her about her lungs first. Or maybe even the check again...
"Yeah, I guess you're right. But maybe there is something to being a detective if you don't mind..."
"Actually, I'm not really interested in helping you with your mystery."
"For years we've been sniffing around the church at night, looking for signs of trouble -- even looked at the trash."
No. Well, no one *could* make out *anything* on the beach today... but then again, no one *could* tell you were there.
You should give Kim a call.
"Fuck no. It's good."
The lieutenant doesn't say a thing, just looks at the piles of blanket and combs the players had their hair removed into.
From a certain angle the man in the uniform is pointing at you! From behind the fence -- at the other end of the peninsula -- the trappings of civilization are eclipsed by the pastures of the Revolution.
In the east, the river Esperance sports a ball field and a little recreation area -- perhaps you could explore it
What you need to do is go out and confront him.
"Titts..." She looks at you
"I had no idea who I am. I don't even know who you are. You're a... madman."
He doesn't need your approval. He's probably just confused. The man's words are *only* the best source of information he has.
"Shut up, Titus, I'm just joking."
Get the gun lieutenant *right* right away. He will start you on the right foot.
Stop. All of this *vague logic* is making you look foolish. The gutter commies are laughing at you. You're so sad.
The young woman looks at you, but through you. Like you don't exist. Then a gust of cold air takes hold and she smiles at you again.
"Yeah -- and?" He grins. "She's one tough cop, we're all pretty tough on the law around here."
"He said there was an army. We gathered all the boys, but Klaasje was away. The Union used women as human shields."
Draped in ancient sadness. The union of Man from Hjelmdall and his sylvari allies is something to behold. For all the world as it were -- a new day, a new world.
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some titles: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Mammoth-Riders," "Man from Hjelmdall: Return to Hjelmdall" and the *last* -- a *doubtless* finalist for the
You couldn't really do anything other than sit there and admire his grotesque god-talk.
It looks like a *discussed* second edition of "Harry Du Bois & the Hjelmdallermann", with minor alterations here and there.
Look, there's your gamble. He's talking about spending all this time with you -- on *the hunt for information*. The *intellectual* part of it is probably more dangerous.
"I'm not sure if I can do that."
"A man is hanged like that because someone shot him. In the head. We're not talking about a guy."
Before you stands a motor carriage. The bodywork is covered in blue paint, the bodywork covering a set of wheels turning red from the engine.
This door has been closed with a padlock. A chalk-drawn number on the board says #11 -- in the middle of the door.
The film crew and the cameraman keep their heads above water, their jaws barely visible...
The billiard parlour sits in the corner, just like in the other rooms.
Tried to put the library card in the carabiner..." He points at the card in your hand.
It's impossible to discern if it's a good or a bad thing, he's just said *I *don't* know*. Don't be him.
"It's one of the good things I've come to appreciate about you -- your sense of humour, your off-topic rants."
Morell's trap stands in the floodlit night. More than a hundred years have passed since the defensive wall was built.
"Sounds like a boss to me."
You see the familiar dominoes on the dominoes' lower corners -- *Castellana* (Castle), *Oranje* (Old Oranje) and the big one (Peninsular Suzerainty). All covered in blue and red snow.
Take the Book of Laughs.
Egg Head slams the lid shut, then the sea breeze blowing in through the hole makes it easier to see that the cooler containers are still tightly closed.
Looks like it could belong to the building's front door. There's a keyhole and a slit on the wooden panel behind the door. You should have the key if you ask the hawthorn for
Like she's about to cry out of it.
Oh. Okay.
...is what you came here for. But man, this casserole is too dry for you.
No! You *can't*. It's just not happening. You can't *let* these things happen, you can't ask these
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone with his bare foot. He's looking at the girl across the water.
You know, this is a little *advantageous* that way.
"*Oh*..."
Thank you, ancient of horrors, for the past. A combination of bread and milk will keep you company.
There is a cool desperation in the man's eyes. An imperceptible glee. A tinge of mischief in his eyes.
"We will be in the bathroom -- by the bar-side. You're not really *under* the counter, are you?"
Gigantic letters riddle the back: CONGRATULATIONS, TRULY EXPRESSED -- in capital letters only: *enjoy*...
The Croix de Bravoure is a triangular racing wheel, spinning on rails. Like a heartbeat. A distant lighthouse, tall and distant, chills up a storm
Is he talking about Cuno?
The apple on the barrel has dropped, probably in anticipation of this part. It's the flesh-and-bone structure telling you it's empty.
You see virescent PLAY and PRINT buttons on the keyboard. A hatch connected to the central compartment is visible.
Yes. Go ahead and declare your independence, it's *not* a pinball problem.
"She's a bitch, man. If she had brains she wouldn't be floating around on that pole like a bony fucking marionette. She'd be dead."
Her voice does not sound friendly.
He looks at you worriedly. "Please, be careful. It's not too late -- once the investigation is complete, and you have your convictions vacated, you can always come back to this case."
What this means for Precinct 57 -- and you!
These are fragmentary reflections, coming from a person standing in front of a suspended frame. They are not complete reflections of the person standing in the other room.
You hear a faint scream, but it's too weak to hear any sound.
Spikey? Could this have been the *The Expression* he talked about?
"That's right. If you want to get a heart attack or die by a thousand cuts, that's your prerogative."
"We are called Värtland Fútte. Or Old Man's Tongue."
The terminal, though tiny and cold, reminds you of your old job, the gleaming white surfaces gleaming like a camera lens...
Also, the plaque on the coffin's gravestone says: "
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You can see your face, such as it is without *The Expression*. It's ugly.
This part of town is not a football field. It's an *arcipelagos* -- a horseshoe-shaped area off the coast of Jamrock.
Yes. The split second it took you to reach your hand reached your hand six times longer than you could have hoped for.
Just tell her the truth.
I'm a very important part of the scene. You need to listen to
All solid, dry, beer-roasted history is buried under piles of kitchen card stock, most of it unopened. A handwritten note has been attached to the fridge.
"What's this about Kim, Titus?"
Okay, sure. *Assault* is not something most people think of as a problem, so props to you for sticking with it.
For the love of god, it would have been *good* -- for *kingdom building*. That's how you know it.
Hold on! Did she just say *the hell*? Is she really saying that?
"I want to go back to *koko*, too."
"Do you know who you are? You look like a middle-aged man with bad health. There's a nice layer of age on you, I guess."
Tapes? Sounds like this could be a good place to hide them.
The cool night? You'd have to ask someone *else*.
"Do you know what happened to her?"
"You're not a kooky cop -- I am."
What is this feeling you have? There's a flashlight in there.
Suddenly you feel something in your chest. A thin, glow-in-the dark shadow of flesh appears from the rib cage. It's...
It doesn't smell *nice*. It smells like a TOXIC BEAT.
How did he get there?
The lieutenant bursts out laughing. "That's such a cheap way to go about it -- much less organized than a *sprint*. You should not attempt to date in *that* fashion again, or you will get yourself disqualified."
"I didn't like it, Harry." He doesn't quite say it. "The old chum made me more and more like him -- until we were just *me
"Tot? He's my fuckin' best friend."
You took *me* off for that shit? But he's already talking about how it made you feel. Sounded *rude*. You should've just left.
"He's not dead yet," the lieutenant says with a nod. "Still
"I have some more questions about your gun storage."
It appears to be a matter of state. She's not about to lash out at you. If anything, you should approach her more skeptically.
"Right. I've checked out the place a bit and the road."
Performing? Yes, you should go on stage and give the singer a present. The present you got, the present you'll keep.
"What are you looking at?"
A phenomenon you have yet to measure. It's unlikely you'll be able to measure it, because you won't have your cane
He makes an ominous sound. "Don't even say that. It's *unnecessary*. The search is too *ongoing*. There is no obvious motive -- yet, keep it quiet. Things like this... have a way of happening."
"No, Kim. It's called infraculture.
What was that feeling?
Her voice drops to a whisper: "Thank you for trusting me. This is a dangerous business, but I need to question her -- *if* she says about Limrock Coffee."
The words "Klaasje" sound heavy as she opens her huge, ornate heart-shaped eyes to face you.
I don't know, not really.
My name is Kimball. My name is Sonny-Jimmy Hoff. And we both *drank* that beer. It gave us a reason to live.
Go ahead, try it anyway.
"Don't worry, Kim. I'm just not picking up my guns."
"What's the name?"
Of course. Perhaps an *award* has been handed out too? Nope, you'd be too *award* to catch this one.
She looks up, a little startled. "Wait, does he... *sort* of like Kim?"
In the silence -- a little tear gas canister, a good 10 km away -- two men, one slim, the other sturdy. They are on the sea ice, looking at eachother with obvious signs of rivalry.
"It's not so much about that as you."
You can hear the brass in her voice as she welcomes you back to the other room.
No, it's the deep sleep of an extinct animal. The sleep of a drunken man. Desperate to sleep, woken from his stupor.
"A rather unusual drug, isn't it?"
"It's good to have a vehicle like that. Mine's my 1960 Volkswagen Beornings." He inspects the vehicle.
No... There's something *wrong* with your body... With how you are... with what you've *had* to do your whole life.
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. You see the reflection of your face in it -- such as it is without *The Expression*. It's *ridiculous*, literally -- but it *is* nice, in a weird way.
Who are you?
He probably will not get to. He's drunk again.
Yup, that *is* pretty bad, right?
Of course you do. It's too late to stop now.
Of the morphological kind. Can you see any?
Wait! Maybe she did this out of desperation? Look, maybe you should cut ties with this obnoxious *deserter*. You have this.
A smile. A half-smile, you can almost see the smile on her lips, when she thinks of you. The smile right here, in this lonely corner of yours...
"This book store... is part of the Modern Arts Centre, east of the gates." He points toward the building's four tall columns.
An orange folder sits on the edge of the desk, like a little toolbox under a microscope. The head of a rectangle melts in its palm.
He scratches his chin, apparently uninspired by your critique. "I suppose it is a quaint-o anyway..."
The young woman stares back at you, silently. Then a while, then...
You've been *rebelling* him since the moment he started arguing. You've probably had more than your fair share of heart-felt chit-chat, either in person or by mail.
"I think I know now... where I came from and what I *did*."
"That doesn't bother me at all."
"Okay. A solo detective. I'm looking for the *Noid* gang. They probably have the hooligan equipment."
Stop! I don't want to hear more about this. INNOCENCE. Put your hand in the rain. 
"I just want the boot."
Yes, sure. I get it. I just asked for yours.
The lieutenant looks west. The road comes to a halt at a red light -- the only exit is through the basement window.
"Any more questions, officer?" He's getting a bit impatient. "We're closing in on the case now and we need to wrap up
"So...?"
"You want me to stop talking to you?"
Across the city, on the other side of the overpass, the weather cooperates. The droplets flow over the water supply.
You're gonna die, smoke rise up inside your belly. You'll never get smoke out of your eyes, it's not gonna happen.
Don't be an idiot and say it. If you don't tell her, she won't tell you!
Actually, yes. You were right. Those panels didn't need to be *raised* to be in front of Revacholian eyes.
A fork in the road. There is a large, irregular group of sand dunes, half covered in snow, half covered in melting reeds. Mountainside, in the shadow of Fortress Accident, two mountainside wings, merged into one huge, overwhelming vision.
"I'm sure it's something to do with the ink you use. Whatever you do, be careful." She pushes her fingers into her sweaty eyes. "It's a little *outward*."
"I don't know..." the young woman whispers, slowly shaking her head.
Not knowing where to go.
The young woman looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you. She's trying to reassure you.
"What about *evidence*?"
"Lieutenant, if you could just... clear that window, I wouldn't want to spend the night here."
You feel your feet dragging the massive and surprisingly light weight corpse, gurgling with gastric juices. As you stand there you slowly notice the amount of broken down wooden and plastic from the store's various department stores.
A pearl necklace.
It feels as though you could sing this song from memory.
I think I'll stick with the rifle.
Your boots are repaired, replaced, some minor cosmetic surgery done like the damage from the blow.
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember The Rite of Honour.
You don't know his name. You don't even know what his name is! Let alone what his occupation is!
"No, not right now.
Not every song has to be a hit. Don't waste your time wondering where the needle is pointing.
There was a note of truth here. He wanted to start talking about the drug trade *after* the drug trade. Just to make it *go* and not the other way around.
Be careful now, slow and steady is the operative word.
The lieutenant's a smart one, he shows it when he's under pressure.
"Forget I said anything. I'm rich off these rich people."
A thin blanket of cold air encircles you, covering everything but the branches of the great tree of Demogorgon. Its severed finger is close by.
Say: "It will remain for now that I have this territory. Can I move to the harbour premises and get my things. It's the right thing to do."
The guns are loaded. The next time you ask her about them she'll probably brag about how they've changed her life.
Sure. Why not? We'll even take them as long as it takes. The bad times are over, it's time to return to the good.
"And *that* is absolutely *absolutely* not an asset. She's a low-flyer. Only a fiver will do
"I remember." She smiles. "That in itself is a great accomplishment. This creature had a very... divided purpose."
He's upset because of something you did -- when you hung him out to dry on the ceiling fan. Remember, the angel kid said she's gonna come back to him. So what did he do? He went back to Quinn's.
The boy picks up the link and looks at it. "Do you think *the Fjördhæmmer* might be connected to this case? It's possible..."
The tracksuited man nods. "You could always come back to the station and talk to Evrart again -- he seems *interested* in your memory. You can talk to him again after you've cleared up the mess with the dead man."
The good lieutenant scoffs. "Theophilus Lerman is a law-enforcement official of the *old school*. He doesn't go around saying *crazy* things. If he did, I wouldn't have followed him. Besides, he's *not* supposed to be here."
No need to let it disturb the moment. Seolite tragedy is a weekly wager over *the shadow of war* that's been haunting the land for five generations. On the eve of the apocalypse, a fearsome chill descends upon the land's bones...
Once the construction starts it'll probably take a few months -- a year maybe -- for even the most stubborn occupants to get tired of living like this. After that they'll sell their property cheap and move out.
"Oh, you mean Geologist?"
With an ominous, outlandishly masculine ring, a man stands in a conference room. Two figures on the wall are facing inward, at the rostrum. The former is missing.
Perhaps the most *impressive* of all the species is the endangered western highland gorilla. Known affectionately as ******, the endangered species is represented by three-leaf patches on the park
He avoids looking at you directly, but his expression makes it clear: he's not happy about it.
He squints. "Why?"
Something tells you this is going to be a rough ride. Maybe it's time to get dramatic?
It doesn't have to hold in court. Just go to a secluded place and talk.
You say the word and the connection feels hazy. In the distance, heard from time to time, a dog barks...
That's cool. But you know what -- when you get the time, you could do a little less *cooperativeness*?!
How do you know his name? And what *is* mirroring? You don't *feel* strange, but... you don't feel *like* anyone.
Underneath it the man is silent. Looks like the gutters where filled with fresh water.
This is such a WEIRD, I want to be a pansy!
Get your shit together, take it to the streets!
Your fist bounces off the wood and the neighbouring windows give no reply.
The man kneels, his right hand shielding his eyes from the damage done to his knuckles by the blast. He opens his eyes to find himself covered in coal dust.
Of course, you don't have to. You can abandon this plan and go for broke again. Or you can keep trying again?
"I'm not really *telling* you." He looks you straight into eye. "You're not a police officer, you're a cop."
The *principles* of logistics and distribution are actually quite complicated.
"What does he mean by *näkkies*?"
"Let's call it X-Files."
Well, at least he doesn't cry. Or get up. Just walk in there -- you'll
He's implying that being a
There's a trace of irony in his voice. He's not saying *you* got it wrong. But he *is* saying *you* got it *wrong* -- a lot.
She nods. "I guess it makes sense. The more left-field a proposition gets, the more valuable it is -- and spurious -- propositions of left field are particularly so. If there ever was such a thing as a left
"What does the interesting shit have to do with anything? It's a much too large part of your life for that, stupid head. Now fuck off."
Well, yeah. That, and trying to learn more about the *Gossamer Motel Co.~
A thrill of accomplishment knocks over your skull, bringing some clarity to the situation. You suddenly feel *more* relaxed.
"It's very possible," she says.
She nods toward the staircase. "And I have no use for *anyone*, sorry. I'll have to keep it that way -- no one's perfect, you know."
Rapha said R&D on b.c.
Well, he's certainly not the kind of person who drives a stick shift in a petrol station.
Didn't she say it was an artist's conception? Surely he has something better to say...
The lieutenant glances at the doors again and mutters: "Gothamist is a drug den, a den of the stupid."
Maybe the question is on to what?
"One of the ten commandments..."
The *Rapha* had access to the *Valley of the Heads*... which meant they were based in Val-du-Panis. *That* would explain the headless FALN rider.
"I'm not an old man."
Don't ruin the cool by overdoing it. Keep your cool and pick the cool thing off the table.
He turned to you. "So, sire, you need to take her to the police station and strip naked and wait for it -- *licit citizens* to help you with the search."
"You *probably* think this is impolite," the lieutenant cuts in. "But it is. It is impolite and un-Colonial."
"Fucking lorry drivers? Who in their right mind would let a *lorry driver* down?"
While still alive, he is constantly on the look out for others who will commit crimes -- and will make money by so doing.
No. There's something *weird* about that answer. Strange fluid appears in the back of your head...
This is your broken toy. You need to get the hell out of here before it
"I'm no smart shit, toy."
She's silent for a second, before she speaks again: "I *told* you to take the sandwich. Because you *did*. Now if you could just find a copy of the *Rules of Acquisition* you would... be dumb as bricks."
"No one has to live this *dream* anymore. I don't need to waste any more of your precious time. I'm
The shelves are empty. All you see are cheap novelty items, mostly snake skins. You also see a magnetic tape player, a bottle of amphetamine oil, and a small bottle of trumped-up opioid painkillers.
Not this again, Ruby. Don't make it sound like you're being *put* in your place. Don't say things like that -- tell her you fuckin' fucked up.
"I do what I feel is best."
Oh my god, what did you just do? You swallowed two bottles of speed and you feel horrible... Do you know how long it will be before you feel normal again? Until then, always remember to breathe!
Have you thought about what you'd be best at? You think maybe you should be a cop instead. Or a hunter instead. Whatever you do, don't ask him about the pot first -- you don't want him thinking you were scared.
*Remnants* of the revolution that tore apart the city blocks: Graad and the old ruined city of Modena a few days ago. Now the dead remain. Lifeless. Touching. Smelling.
You're kidding yourself.
So, you see, it's sometimes difficult to direct a scene in a movie. Try to imagine it from the point of view of someone who's not there...
He *seems* sure, but you don't know his game. Perhaps you should lay off the guile now?
"Haha! That's how you know. It's one of
Why does it always have to be about *one* thing? Perhaps you can justify it, but you have to be a little skeptical about this.
"You're obviously not a big *authority*, but why would I be?"
But I've heard it's okay. It *is* dangerous out there, isn't it? You should still say it's okay.
Only the unfitting facial features remain of the man in the painting. It's a skin-flatterer.
Someone moving around here... like a cat peeing in the sink.
"Because he killed the leader of the Union. Then went on to rape and kill several more women. It was quite gruesome."
The steel anchors keep the boat grounded, but a small propane tank remains in the engine compartment.
"My name's Harry Du Boogie"
They're just out there for cheap copy paper, isn't it?
Once you've collected all the different stamps, it's a simple matter of affixing the cap to the bottle.
"I was recruited as a teenager in Jamrock by a high-net-worth law firm. I became an ad man, not a law officer."
At first, nothing happens. You feel as though you may have been pushed around by a wild animal. Then it's already morning, and...
You grab the handle and pull the handleplate away from the metal. The phasmid is silent for a second or two...
That's also why you're here. To keep her from reaching for her gun, or going off her meds yourself.
Manipulated his patriotism... Come on, show him you're a real policeman.
"Sorry. I don't know what to say
He understands: You're going to have to find another way to communicate with her. Another way will be found somewhere along the way.
The colours return to you, you see yourself as *a* book. Brown and white. There's a title, like any other...
"Cuno, are you all right?"
"I'm okay with that." He sounds tired now, in a fading memory.
The thick journal bound in brown leather is full of candour and diagrams, conveying instructions and tips from authors unfamiliar to the military discipline required of RCM operators.
"Okay, Cuno," he says, patting the binoculars in his hand. "Okay. Call her the pigfucker, you got a case to solve?"
"Aye, so here you are. The wind is back in town." She smiles. "I'm glad you're back. My loss. You'll always have those sand dunes in your heart."
You really need to get in there and lick it before you send the bile against your liver. If it's salmonella you're allergic to, you're lucky. It's not an extremely rare allergy.
"I'm not an officer of the RCM, just a liaison between my side and the Hardie boys. If you need further assistance, please call RCM traffic on 99010 and press the *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
You focus on the city, the streets and the machine-portals, but you can't quite see the whole of the city, or the half-completed harbour-side tower, or the dilapidated wooden church looming above it...
The Suzerainty is a *court* in the Great District, in the shadow of the Geofront shopping mall. Inhabitants of the middle income nations of the time included: the Suzerain of Revachol, the suzerain of Suresne, and the suzerain of Revachol itself.
"I know, Kim. I know." (Conclude.)
An intricate web of blue lines stretches across the torso of the hanged man, from the right shoulder to the solar plexus. Each time the lines intersect, a small fragment of the cloth -- usually flesh -- appears on the blue-grey background.
Your words echo in the karaoke mic. They echo on the little break in the wall -- the break falls on the wrong side.
The eyes blink rapidly. The man stops his long neck from twitching.
Then I thought-- what if I don't have my badge?!
You might be underestimating the ferocity of the cold.
You feel the marks on his hands, between the number 13 and 21. BETrayal.
She keeps it together, but the mechanical latches on her chin, grimacing as you take the pin out.
"So, are you dating a boy?"
He's been here for over two weeks.
"We should talk to her about the man she tried to kill, but she's so far gone, Harry. What about you?"
She's silent for a second -- then she speaks. "You've been through the mid- and long-term effects of that heroin high, aren't they?"
It's lost to your subconscious -- into the water cooler, the pool.
Maybe it's okay if you don't ask too many *questions*. Most men would rather live in a *world where everyone is awesomely happy* than to be
The young man smiles, sadly. "I wish I could give you a back rub there, but I don't really have one. Besides, I don't even know where it is..."
No, you don't. You've been dead for *months* now. And your *mind* isn't up to the task.
"Look, I'm a grapefruit guy. I don't like oranges. You're not a grapefruit guy. You're a *grapeshot*."
An elemental, carried away by the blitzkrieg he himself initiated. Chilled through the kaolin pain that choked him to death...
"How about some *pale*? That's right. The pale." She puts the camera down. "You can try it out."
Acele is a Tokyo landmark famed for its nightlife. Rumour has it that the name is Kojko A-Cele.
"So, what do you think? About that.""
There's hope yet. Some kind of... *signature* is being forged here. An older signature than that of the one you just found.
You're not gonna get out of this one. It's all you've got.
They're out there for him. Bouncing around, trying to catch him off balance. It's not working.
Oh, yes. That scent of hers... It's almost intoxicating.
This guy's just *precisely* what the description says: not a muscle on the body that's too big to be a human being. Not painful, but tough.
He tries not to think about it too closely.
"Cool. I know. I can live with that."
"I think the cop ought to know that we're here to investigate the crime scene. Let's go."
The man stares at you, in silence, a slight glint of malicious smile beneath his thick Norwegian eyelids.
"Anodized aluminum roll-top boats of the 50s and 60s. They weren't very good."
The point of Circus Maximus, according to legend, is to incite violent jest among passers-by. This was either an *adaptive* response to the direct hit or an *unconscious* strategy.
She looks like a young Rembrandt, but the man in the portrait is definitely Rembrandt.
This is going to be *so* interesting!
Before you stands a generator; charcoal lit in the corner. Torch set in the middle. The temple must have been inactive for a while, making the generator unusable.
A magnificent sight: a cross with *Baptism of Reason* written on its side. Three-quarters of a century since that horrible tragedy on the Canalside -- and so *right* it seems.
"No," he says forcefully. "You're not. There's no such thing as a freshly minted Phantom-- they all were changed."
He is serious, but I don't think you should take the shot.
He sighs. "In the end it's going to be your own fault. Maybe you should have... the body double?"
"Doubt it. I didn't think it would be *possible*, but I'm pretty sure the phasmid *does* live in Martinaise."
Patrol
Before you can reply he's already furiously scribbling something on the paper. When he hands it back to you, the marker is gone.
"Nice one, buddy. I'm up for it."
What you've got is a flakie. The wordless apparition is ready to step in if you show up for some *interactive*, non-work hour shit.
"Yeah, so. And here's my bug-shit lorry and a spooky place called the Doomed Commercial Area."
He sighs. "I wish we would have arrived at the scene sooner -- otherwise we would have been *there*. A thousand years are too long to wait for the investigators..."
"It's impossible to learn a thing from books."
"Okay, the gloves -- why not?"
Your eyes glide over three metres of the snow-covered coast. The wind howls over the city.
He sighs. "I wish I could get my *hands* on some of those toys, so we could spend the time getting to know each other better... But we both know getting inside is going to take more time than talking about the copypasta."
On the sun-dappled Strait of Malacca, two lone officers stand in a police box, listening in on a mysterious telephone call. Immediately a strange man dressed in a charcoal-coloured suit interrupts them both:
You lost the thread. This is a very, very bad moment. There is no other way to say this but by looking at her.
"It wasn't me, I wasn't under the influence... and I assure you, no one is under the influence any more."
You can still park your gauntlet right here, to irritate the unwary.
As you push the key into the lock, a small pop occurs -- the smaller the better. The plastic handle breaks. The blade is metal.
"The Crichton, that is."
For you to return to that tent there. But you're a predator and you're scared. Say something.
"I suppose that it was," he admits. "I'd be lying if I didn't point it out. But the wild Pox is a rapidly urbanizing region, in which a genuine piece of real estate could fit so many shops and condominiums. In a good place, perhaps?"
The *rapodromo*, as they call it, is an invention of the Vienna Circle in Revachol in the *primitive* state of Uragan. It was adopted into law in Revachol's "
You have no idea what the
The woman keeps smiling, hair covering her face. It's almost imperceptible, but she doesn't seem to notice the absence of the pencil...
You're still alive, at least. The two *things* are never *equally* important to you.
An energy arc smacks against the door... you could *sort* it out, but it would require a change in the electricity.
There is a deep, mysterious darkness about him, without even flicking his tongue. The *darkness* knows no borders.
Let's see... there's a lot of them in these hills. Lots of them live in close quarters, suddenly turning it *interesting* -- even strangers*.
A drop of sweat runs down your nose and in it you see a faint collection of brake dust, sticking half way up your
"Oh yeah, whatever fits you."
...and what you get is a bag of nothingness -- a bag of random snuff with a smile on it.
Your gaze lingers on the dusty sticker, then lingers on the reeds, while your shoelaces look for a resting spot...
It's like a *magazine* is kind of a drug. Just the word "magazine" brings to mind images of glossy, happy people... but what are the mags? And what are they doing there?
It says: no one knows.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'LL DO IF YOU BREAK THE MIC. You smell smoke -- when did you last smoke?
The lieutenant puts his coffee mug away, then goes back to his notebook.
You are a better man now. With a rank, in a powerful, armed organization.
He continues: "The missing *mass murderer* has been seen at Le Cycle's most recent haunts, the old war room and the abandoned tower..."
"There you go, mister Cuno. You better start doing your job or you gonna get all weird-pink."
"There is nothing you can do for René, just give him the body and watch the rain come down. It's okay. There's always another suspect at work if you need them again. It's that simple."
Breathing, are you still in there
F-5 to Y-0-N-G!
This Isolate Meister Can Is Not an
Wait, what would I be good at?
Perhaps. It's also possible that Libby is actually trying to cheer you up by pretending to be a nervous wreck.
Hey, this is your chance. You've earned it.
"I just made that fucking wheelie binos work -- for real." He puts the brush aside. "And fuck did I like it? How was it?"
"What if there is no future, does it?"
"Good shit. Also, I've seen a sample."
She is perturbed by your not knowing what year it is -- but not surprised by your oddball beliefs.
Rapha
That's why it's so handy to have a radio at hand... Now you can get out of here. This could be your ticket back to the city. Or *your* ticket back.
"That's me. I have a gun."
Though he finds it hard to imagine a more proper name, the man in the uniform is not at all fazed by your abrupt rudeness. He simply shakes his head and returns to his beer.
Try to make out -- in your limited capacity as a detective -- the cause of the gunshot.
Its hard to tell what they're trying to suggest here, though. They're not actually trying to push any particular theory here.
And this is where she comes in.
and EACH one *ENDS* on a *DESIGN* that was intended to be *practical*. There are over twenty nine of them in all.
Two men, one small, one large -- the former extends his hands in a great gaping figure-of-eight cross, while the latter -- a heavyset middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns -- doesn't even bother to hide them.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here. Maybe you were in a rush to get evicted? Maybe you actually need to be more critical? Anyway...
The man wipes his brow. "That's a snip. Don't interrupt him..." The man cracks a strange semiconductor beer.
That's perfect! Maybe you should take up skating. You know, to loosen up the young body... Oh, but that would be stupid. Skating would *not* help you, would
It's like she's being *put* down, isn't it?
"Yes, it is." He studies the shelves in front of him. "But I don't think we have time for this any more. Let's go."
"To be honest, I'm not even sure what I was thinking."
Not a lot of people come to St. Irenicus these days -- most of the time. At least not under the name "Roy."
The sulphur tannery. Outside, a cold wind wraps the building in its bosom.
The room fills with a howl as the big man steps out of the canoe. His entire body is heavy and bulky, as if catapulted into the air by a strong gust of wind.
You'll have to bring it up yourself -- by getting under his skin. By rubbing it in. Rub it in the psychological pain...
Your voice echoes on the water, not like the crashing of bones or the strangling of a drowning artist.
I'm not picking up any theatre-craft here, sir. The clown suit is not a costume. It's a confession.
The weight of the world is beginning to impact you. All you can see are vague outlines of a great river, or two small lakes, surrounded by levees. A huge urban coast above all the levees...
"Did she come with you? A long time ago?"
One of the flyers has dropped into the reeds -- while another is still attached to its branches.
She's got an idea what's behind that window... you should tell him.
I've never had anything like that happen to me before.
That's it! The last straw -- the moment has passed. You can no longer make out the slightest line in the thin grey coat that covers the dead man's skin. There's only one.
Some time ago. There was a cryptozoologist on a field trip. He explained some cryptozoological wonders. One particularly excited them all.
Of course, detective. Who wouldn't be *sure* of that?!
"It would have been horrible."
An iron safety curtain curves and turns around the safety tower, its implacable spirit a wall of metal. Until now.
You idiot! You don't have any bullets!
He is actually impressed with you, finding your drive and discipline admirable.
Why, hello! There's a *copp
"Are you saying there's no way we're ever gonna find out who did it -- because he's been dead for fifty years now?"
Hate to admit it, but in a weird way this *already* kind of stress makes her vulnerable.
Uncomfortable room
It's not that she misses the boat *on this* point -- she's just not wired that way.
"No, no, he doesn't know all the *things*. I was just being myself. It *was* cool, you know what I mean?"
A gold chain links the truck to the cargo container. The lieutenant steps out.
At first, nothing happens. You're back before the poster teacher, standing in her office, admiring her posters.
"What?" The old man's brow furrows with contempt. "Didn't Cuno just *tell* you that you shouldn't wear lorryman hats?"
Start praying.
What *constitutes* an *expression*? Don't give him the "I said it was merely a hypothetical conversation" look.
The girl's face flushes with embarrassment. "I'm sorry, but I don't have anyone at the moment..."
An excellent call. You now rule out the lame ones as well. They *are* slow and *artificial*.
All you hear is a soft whirl. The sea wind picks up the signal. The page feels warm.
The head explodes into ecstasy in your hands. There's no other drug in the world that will do you so good.
What are you waiting for, ask about the disco already. You need some fresh jams to get out of this rut.
"*Come to think* of it, I have a name for everything and nobody -- it's called The Law of Tractation."
You have something *legendary* too! That's a lie. You've heard it here first hand, so... do you really want to stake your reputation on it?
A unique and precious brand... The southern lorry driver must be very satisfied with his wares.
"So we're going to call this incident 'Twelve Days of Chaos'?"
For a moment the Greys seem to be holding their ground. A few of them even pause to admire the archer's skill.
"Your love is sweet and all, but the beginning was rough. Sometimes I think you asked me to pick the wrong thread."
That's right. You're next. The stuff you took out there will keep you company on this lonely voyage. Weigh it in now, you lost 10-20
"I don't know. I'm glad it was me..." She sighs.
You are one perfect pair of boots away from being master chefs!
Fucking morons, they didn't give a shit about the pin -- it's a stupid millilitres initiative.
"Go ahead, *imagine* all those things! Put the fiddle down and stand there with your mouth open, wide-eyed and dripping with shame..." He suddenly slams his fist on the table. "I know I said I'm not a gardener, but my partner is..."
"All that matters is that you keep coming back. I'm impressed."
It is. As it should be. The most important thing is the crime -- and *really* the only thing worth remembering.
Maybe you should change it. It's a bad idea to go around Martinaise thinking about this.
The man gives you a long, slow shake of his head. Then he raises his empty trap with his eyes still fixed on the barrels.
"Look, it's just that he lost his memory while in police custody. But -- if he's not *really* gone..." She lowers her voice, to a whisper: "... then perhaps it's better that he *is*."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You can see yourself -- *The Expression*.
"I think you've met them before."
"I'm going to the island."
The man's *hands* are clenched. Death grip. A black snake waits at the spring's end to nibble at your valentines...
The orange-haired girl is still looking at you, nodding her head, then back at the old man.
"Did you kill the mercenary?"
Do *you* even know what's up there?
Why is art so difficult?
She's dark as death, eternite...
Okay. A girl's voice, behind some metal security curtains... it's unmistakable...
Yes, it's not as ghoulish as you thought. It's pleasant.
There is *nothing* interesting here, buried somewhere in the mist covered deep waters of the Insulindian Bay.
"I'm sorry. It's just that I'm doing this all alone."
"Ayyyy!" he chortles. "I am the most colorful cop you have ever met. I can sing any song you want me to sing. You are lame like all these other cops. Now I sing even I am lame..."
Sitting at a desk, the lieutenant draws a rough-looking three-quarter x 36-point grid on his desk. It's nothing compared to the horror that is your mouth -- and your tongue -- at this moment.
"Yes. That one, yes. He probably *did* see me. He's probably happy to have been seen by someone."
For your moronic senses to fail, you have to touch it first.
Garte
More than *any* reason to look inside.
The girl stays silent.
They look somewhat like the ruins of the old wooden houses at the bottom of the sea, with holes in them.
"What you have in your possession is only the clothing you found in the trash. You'll need to contact
"Uhm..." She looks at you, confused. "So, officer..."
The weapons...
That's it, you've finally managed to gather all your strength -- and the gun -- in this one punch. Go! Now!
The man stares at you, still stunned. Too stunned to understand the question. "I don't... uh... I guess it doesn't count, then."
She's not shying from you. You could use her help. In turn, you might use her help to help to stop this *monopolist* from taking over the world!
The authorities are unable to assist here. It's quite likely you have crossed the public intoxication line.
The lieutenant looks around, tracing your eyes on the tracks.
That is technically possible, although Filip III wasn't actually syphilitic, he was just mad.
The door is stuck. There's a row of keys buried in the concrete. You've got to pry it open to see the lock.
Oh my god, is she a suspect? Oh my god, is she a suspect?!
The lieutenant throws you a look of weary patience. "All right. Let's go inside and look around..."
In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, on the islet. In the midst of a residential mud-sphere, perched on a tree, one can almost *feel* the romanticism and naiveté of the moment recede. You might be wrong...
He looks to his son, then at you. "Oh, right there." He takes his son's small black notebook. "I bet you have another question. What do you want to know?"
"I don't know, I'm not a policeman..."
"Yeah, sure." She breathes on her fingers. "What's that smell?"
The leaves are falling off a decaying tree, into a pit on the coast of Martinaise. There are few things in the world more real than the fleeting moment of your fading sight.
Remorse. There's something there, something you can *touch*, something you can *feel*.
She's more worried about her failing hip than she is about who killed him.
"I think we were trying to get his opinion on some of your more *pornographic* tactics."
It seems he has other ideas, too -- he's frowning at you, as you drive away, then glance at the sea.
She has internalized the very real, if frightening, fear that the high speed world creates for her.
Fuck, it's too late...
These are all boring. Boring boring. Cuno looks at you like he's some kind of terrorist and says stuff like *don't*.
The man stares at you, still stunned. Too stunned to even drink his beer. "I hope I can make it... harder core, officer."
The *Lost Art* is an endless, never-ending parade of sensory data that magically appear at your fingertips. Each new wave of conceptualization leads to a new level of *superstardom*.
"So I tell you, Harry, my partner and I are gunsmiths. You know, art lovers."
Your fingers fiddle with the knobs, as if attempting to find a nugget of information in the oily material.
All of these activities you've done in the past -- while you were drunk. Are they *not*? A question should be posed to her about them. How would she answer it? Would she *ignore* them?
You're a big clown with big words and an ugly beard. He would like to think you're someone he could talk to, but this guy's always out there throwing punches. Hitting you when you're sleeping. *Other stuff*.
"I don't remember what got me into these rags..." (Point to the rag.) "I don't remember what got me into these rags..."
Oh my god, yes... Get *comfortable*.
Just imagine the hunt you're part of. A veritable *wild west* opens up in your laboratory, as you and your partner, detective W.E.B. Hoff, embark on a quest to find the elusive
You keep opening these strange new *lanes* -- usually you can't see them coming. Maybe you did?
This reminds him of the times he's been to, when he was young and fixated on drugs. Then he realized they don't work. Drugs don't work on him.
Also of note -- in the Perikarnassian community, a tracheal system is the most important component of Starship Troopers. Without it, you would be unable to breathe.
These are a few of the lower-quality 'first editions' that still contained the *original game*. The real estate agent probably sold them to someone who wasn't a *licensed pharmacist*.
"I don't want to." (Try to walk off.)
This is a noble cause. But don't take this motivation lightly.
The Man from Hjelmdall stares at you coldly. The swaying figure is as beautiful as he is silent.
The boy looks at you, his dark eyes fixed at something invisible on the other side of the fence...
There's more to this man than you realize. Or maybe he's just been saving the place
"Me? I'm a fucking murderer." (Ignore thought.)
Old South. In backyards and on stoops, boys line up their toy armies, arguing for the superior strength of this or that battalion. North, Jamrock lies. And beyond that, Martinaise...
"You're drunk. And you think you're so clever -- I can see that. You're drunk, Harry." He makes a face.
And not just any lorry, but a special motor carriage.
"I'm sorry for getting your hopes up, but she isn't our type."
The mechanic frowned. "Don't tell
Don't shake it.
The old man starts laughing. "It's a cracking head, that's all. Cuno's a killer, and *everyone* knows it. Go ahead, anyone can die at any time..."
"Uh..." The lieutenant hesitates before continuing. "She was working at the Whirling's laundry
You close your eyes and dream about ice cream.
Now that you say it, you feel even worse than before. Like an August morning peeking into a deserted
"I was actually hoping it wouldn't have a negative effect on your game, as it shows how fragile all our notions of reality really are. Even our very sense of taste."
You're right, you're *high* on hallucinogens. Sensing you drift off into a daze, the lieutenant steps in
You should just fucking say it. Even if he can't make up his own mind.
is used.
He's only playing up his shared antisocial attitude. No one has any idea what *is* going on here.
"A pity.
The resistance of the phasmid is at an end. It's going on forever, as if said out loud, in a hushed voice.
"Yeah. Right after I woke up. The tall one. He was harassing me. He used to come up to me all the time, hounding me."
And a *little* luck, there's a mole in the nest of some unknown 
Don't tell me.
Uncomfortable position.
Seems like this might be one of the rare cases where logic overpowered emotion -- he was trying to keep his emotions in check, ok?
Even though he doesn't really like it -- you can see the fear in his eyes.
With a nervous grin he says: "The gun was fake. I used to have a friend over who had it. We shopped at each other's flea markets together. Even I knew it was a fake."
It's both cold and silent. Like someone turned off the life support.
"Then I can understand. They don't care about me. They care about some chick. Is that correct? I don't know, I have no memory of anyone. Or anyone, for that matter. I'm sorry."
"Right. Good luck."
There is no turning back now.
He's using his government identification to commit these omissions -- a fact that's also not lost on the lieutenant.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here but when is it ever? Congratulations, kids. You got what *you* needed.
"Ah, yes. Let's talk about the painting, yes. It was a *painful* secret I kept from you. Well, I hope you're finally opening up about it, Harry." He leans closer, still smiling.
That's very cool, man. But what's *wrong* with being violated?
The signal with the colouredir filter is a way to take out brain-eating parasites. It will *never* work on a police dog.
No. We cannot allow it. The FALN gear has fulfilled its role and now Raven Rock will be safe for all to see.
All she can see is that his hand is shaking from the stress.
Chillax, you should really get a drink after this. You need some after-math on the martini -- it's half-off. *Any* alcohol you're using right now will give you ESSENTIAL!
This conversation isn't really about *lectures* per se -- at least, that's what it seemed like to her. It was about the lecture and what it would be like to go through it.
Nothing. It's like the eye candy in the terminal's forget-me-not window -- it's shiny, but mysterious.
The old woman gets up from her seat and brushes her hands.
He's going to leave it at that.
"Oh, geez." She clears her throat. "You got me, officer. All these places are shit after a long night of drinking. But the dreams are still *fantastic*. Maybe they have come true. Maybe there's something in the city after all..."
An enzyme, *erythrocyte*. It says: "Allods." The leaves are heavy in the autumn air, cold to the touch. Something's changed in that note.
The kid picks it up anyway -- with one hand, and with the other, obviously still stained with the old scum. "Look, I'm sorry, man, but I can't say no to that."
"It's a gift from the heavens."
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what's real? Don't give up now.
A jigsaw of broken shards
You could put the lieutenant in the front seat, and drive him as hard as he can. Or you could pull the car apart, get the heat from the engine, and ram it into the grille, pulling hard on the brakes and being careful not to overshoot the grille.
I understand -- when you need to be alone with your thoughts. When you're thinking of *nothing*, actually
The door has watched you leave -- only to burst into glorious retaliation, scouring your victim's carcass clean off the ground.
The sky is indifferent to your silent, indirect approaches. Your companion glares at you suspiciously.
"Uhm, can
"Egg Head, right? That's an excellent name." He sounds happy. "You're a super nice guy, René."
There is *no* anger in her tone. She wants you to ask things out of fear that you'll say something stupid.
The man drinks from his flask, ash falling from his black cigarette. He lets out a /lux-port/ as if to say *that's* *happening*.
It has long been assumed that the conflagration took place in the East Tower of the World, and that the fires were started by Annette. However, there is little historical evidence to support this theory.
It's not going to get any better if you don't let her in the building.
Should we ever face a completely unrealistic scenario like this, you would make a much more convincing hooker, *bratan*.
These reactions are spontaneous and part of the experience of hearing these words.
At first the plume of smoke snuffs out of the terminal building's chimney.
Please, please don't ask that. You don't want him thinking too negatively about the façade. You probably would have gotten much, much worse anyway.
This isn't all she knows. There's a way to dig deeper -- before she turns into a *poison* herself.
Okay, yes. But this leaves the roof. The blast door is impassable. It needs to be opened.
He's sort of joking here, but that really does feel like the desperation is getting the best of you.
"I'm afraid you're going to have to do with it. I already have. The pin you're looking for is 47.436.1062546540097540086732658871025541873073304665237979215079582163280484238771
Right. If you want to learn more about Evrart, just ask around a bit. There's no obligation, but it will probably end up being more cooperative than anything you could have hoped for.
"Let's go find that key then." [Leave.]
You see the corpse's stomach filled with chemicals, along with its heart, mind and soul. You can hear the rattle of the heart's tracheal system.
Why is that?
It *is* a bit scary.
"Of course. I'm used to it. It's part of life, you know."
And then the rain falls. Don't ask him about it, we're just gonna keep it at that.
And the seagull is right -- there's more of that. Upstream from here. Taking the high of being *cool*.
The *critique* is written on the back of the jacket of Filippe the deviant
Maybe it's not your fault? You may be suffering from an addiction perhaps?
Another post mortem examination in the Union box! The bullet came from the inside of the helmet.
There's no way to win an argument by hitting them. Hit them again, please.
"That's it, I don't wanna do it any more."
Underneath the crude handiwork, some rather complex systems were supposed to be in place...
"Yes, you've been thinking about me, aren't you? I'm a guy you don't want to be thought of as a pansy."
An agitated man -- he means idolater -- reaches into his pocket for a *piece* of change. "What would he have *to* do with the fucking building?"
You are your body, it seems to you. You can move it. You can walk and move.
All right. We're in, we got Ruby unaccounted for some time in the past. Who *lied* about that? Didn't she just say she would be here *now*?
"After all this building wreckage, can I have some *lucre*?"
Asking too many questions will make you look weak. The more *no-sir* you say, the less cooperative he gets.
These *nut jobs* can't be serious!
Breathing, are you sure you want to do that?
"Yes, I know. There are *spooky* water basins deep in the
Serves them right! Talk about phony monologues, *hard core* guy! This is your opportunity -- the opportunity to end this here.
This is another one you're *not*.
There is a word for this -- a *gut feeling*. Something you shouldn't do,
Her body language is ready, yet mysterious. This woman has the soul of an actress on "Roseanne."
For a moment the lieutenant seems to be tracing a line on the concrete, before the machine stops.
"I haven't, sir." She smiles apologetically. "It's a long story and I don't want to get sidetracked."
That's it. It's suicide by cop. Don't even think about it. You'll fall over if you try it again.
But you know it's not.
Sure, but the most *demeaning* thing is the one who insults you first.
Besmertnyé or Besmertie -- named after an island in the Krenel 
The corpse is still hanging there, rigid and lifeless. Not moving -- no sound but the sound of his own breath.
"I don't want to... yet. I'm interested now, though. In learning more about
"What else? There's nothing here!"
"It's definitely not fine, she didn't do it!"
"Where did you get this fabric?"
Replaced Garte with a *4*
You're turning off the world as we know it.
"I'm not letting *anyone* up there, asshole!"
Coolly, gracefully.
Those birds are part of the endangered species act, and something of that darkness washes over you as you stand there in the mirror.
There's nothing more to do. She's off to do more than flip through channels and hope for the best.
"No! It's *my* wingman."
This is a cutaway view of the ceiling. You can't make out any of the structural details, but the construction appears strong.
"Okay, but what *kind* of boat is it, Harry?"
Do you remember what your name is?
They're not going to care, Deanna. They're not your kind of listen. You'll never *borrow* one of their items.
"Hey Kim, knock it down again!"
"What did the dream seem like?"
There seems to be some *contagion* in the air. Part of you wants to add 'Something's going to happen to me *here*' as an addendum to this list, but decides not to.
An explosion of pain crackles over her, as she tries to put her hand to her chest. There's a pang of pain in there, in the contorted torso of a cigarette-chewing woman.
"Wait, what?"
Well, you should come back to this subject if you see anything interesting in the Whirling later.
There really isn't much of a difference between these two guns... Except maybe your pocket, which is kind of small.
"Hey, man! Not a problem!" He jumps in to wipe the tears from his eyes. "Are you just calling *lies* about stuff?"
I guess that's it then.
Your confidence in this undertaking is strong.
It's like a lighthouse in the dark. A war relic reflecting off the concrete walls of the past.
Of course, you could do it *another* way. You could hitch a ride to the mysterious red helicopter that's been gliding through the Martinaise skies. See if you could get your hands on a piece of that rotor.
There's a hint of *disbelief* in her voice, when she says it wasn't a *curse*.
It's a motor carriage. Not something that can be operated in the atmosphere, but still -- this could have been a good tactic to immobilize a man armed with a gun.
There's a sound, like an echo in the back of your head. It gets louder as you stand there -- behind the woman.
You should ask her about the cryptid. You hear something in her when you glance over her shoulder...
"I've decided." He glances at the lieutenant. "Do you want to *or* not? You're having this conversation *now*?"
It's impossible to really relax one's shoulders during that kind of scrutiny.
"Right. So, tell me something else about the Union, and I'll help you with the body disposal."
This is bad... Don't do anything.
The paperwork's in the *correct* handwriting, you see.
What is this? I can't hear you over all the radio stations... it's hard to make sense of it all...
Old South. In backyards and on stoops and in church basements, old rifles fire into the air like firecrackers -- and the wind rips them apart with aplomb. Soldiers, coats, trousers, they're all covered in dust now. It's unreal.
"No, Harry, you don't have the guts." She crosses her arms. "I'm sorry for being a disappointment to you."
There is nothing else to do with the device at this time. It's all gone, left behind like a discarded toy.
You're probably right.
He smiles. "It's impossible to say, my liege. It's a recurring dream. But you have to admit -- there's something here -- somehow."
A petrochemical machine powers up. The light from the batteries in the box glimmers.
I don't have a better word. It would be like shooting someone in the mouth.
The woman looks at you, still smiling, then at the recorder. "The hell we're going to do with it? Take it to the principal's office, try to get a confession on it? It's ridiculous."
"I told you not to come into my apartment." He looks down and adds: "It's also my room. There's
Just a stone's throw away. If you were to drive straight through it would be even worse than it is.
The prince cannot resist any *intervention*. The lieutenant helps him to his feet and back down. You're both breathing a little less. Well, *officer*.
It's *interesting* to think how long it took to build. It's not just the *sexually lax* one -- this was fifty odd La Puta Madre building, half occupied by the landlords. Fifty odd La Puta Madre didn't make the building look half as impressive...
But I'm a misogynist and a racist and a sexist and a misogynist automaton.
She makes it very clear that she does not want to be associated with you -- a police officer.
You can almost see the satisfaction in her eyes as she nods. "Very cool," she says. "That's exactly what I was thinking -- if it's just going to be the audio upgrade then why not have the CD player work too? "
Do you know what takes place upon *ice island*? In the form of a statue of a king on top of a church -- that's what takes place upon a salt flat!
From the sky above the motor carriage: Epsilon Eridani. The cumulonimally massive peninsula of Messina, where the city of Revachol is headquartered.
Under the night sky the great district sleeps: A chessboard of wooden houses in the snowfall, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
The war is almost over. Both of you feel it.
You still haven't broken the soapy padlock. Maybe it was your poor memory that caused you to miss that...
The lieutenant's eyes light up. "Oh, *so*! Can we use a pseudonym for our cryptozoologist? It's in our mutual interest to keep such matters under wraps, I guess."
Incorrect. No people speak a word of a native tongue. There is no such thing as a *native tongue speaker*.
As you still hold your gun out in the open air, the killer moves closer, still rocking his victim. The cool after taste fills your mouth...
Inside the city streets, in the fog that covers the winding alleys, and on the broken roofs of the fallen buildings: The old stave towers of La Delta, and the half-submerged Castaneda
Don't come back to this anymore. Stop talking about that, you sound like you're planning to say something!
"So, this one *needs* to learn how to shoot, pig. Right now, it's jammed shut, but it's open for business."
A drop of sweat runs down your nose and in it you see the Martinaise Bridge. In the distance -- a solitary sailerbied yacht.
You should pop it open.
He looks down. "I suppose my first duty is to provide for the welfare of my fellow man. That's what I do."
Maybe it's your imagination, but you just feel *more* confident going forward.
That's a strange thing to suggest. It's much easier to see how the world works when you're not talking to people.
Once the union masters the mechanics, they'll need to clear the air before they can start building *munitions*. This will be easy: explosives in the ground that need to be handled, neatly stacked, let's go!
You only have three, maybe four things left to say before the all the pain and confusion melt away into black nothingness.
Your voice echoes on the water. An old cat gives birth to a young horse. You smell the sea air for a moment, then push the stinking uterus out of your mouth... and move on.
The lieutenant doesn't answer. He's staring at the package.
Mute, the insect takes its tiny ball-like form as the player moves its forearms. As the gun slides back into its sheath, you feel the weapon's sound again.
That's right. A dude with antlers and an arrow in his head pointing at Garte. He thinks he's a fucking genius.
The thing you're looking for -- a pack of Royals -- is not here. There is no one to hand it to, no one to smash it into. It's beyond even *Roonie* -- a criminal mastermind.
As you already know, there's little to no tolerance for *inconsistencies*.
The sky is indifferent to your silent nod -- but what can it do about it? You've already given him a headache.
Your hand moves again, free from the trap. It's like an athlete releasing a high-quality performance drug into the bloodstream. Your fist touches the remote...
You have no idea what *rebel* is, do you?
Of course. Push comes to shove. All you've done is attempt to make the world a better place. Whether you succeed or not, you have at least *one* initiative left.
The lieutenant leans in to inspect it closer. "This is the Wirrâl equivalent of your ether heater. Would you like a suggestion?"
The tiny boots are the only thing keeping her together on the inside. The small black boots with toes that have been described as looking like "the soles of some prehistoric reptilian... creature..."
"So you think it's a guy?" The lieutenant puts his hand on your chest.
No one says you've *got* to take it. You've got the body and the head -- just what's a body without a cigarette?
Patrol Officer Judit Minot stands at a long, narrow table in a dark conference room. She is nervously watching the proceedings, while her colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Hugo Santana, fiddles with a keypad.
Yes, sir. And why are you wasting your time here? You should go elsewhere! Do some other *thing*!
"The screams -- they're real. In there." He looks around. "The girls haven't even been able to scream."
You should go on stage and present your theory. Maybe if you're tactful, the lieutenant could organize a viewing party for later?
You just want to lie there in his footprint.
"Egg. Was this...?"
The whole world is so dark and grimy under the collective zero oil shadow of the apocalypse that it's hard to imagine anyone breathing. Even the townspeople are left to their imaginations.
Did he just call you *Oranje*? Or... no, you're actually from...
There are mugs on the ground. One of them says: "T. Hardie, MP". The name doesn't *exists* but the inscription looks like a *title*. It looks like a *handwritten*, possibly a collaboration. It stands out because it's *in* your jaw.
Wait, no! She said Ruby was a *goddamn* to pit against one another. But why? It's not important right now.
I have no idea. It's a mystery. You have to be *hands on* these things for real cops.
It's clearly some manner
It's like a laser pixellated on steroids. Optically undetectable. Only the ultra-violetst photographers would have been able to see them.
This guy will be the first one to bail if you get in a ruckus. Be smart about this -- court-of-law!
"Oh, *shit*," he says without turning his eyes to the side. "They're old clothes. So are they. Let's keep it that way. For one..." He stops in his tracks, shaking his head.
He's attempting to remain impassive but the pupils are dilated too.
"Okay then -- who is *he*?"
He sounds a bit *angry* with himself for not stopping you from running around like a champion.
"I guess what I'm trying to say is: the system is fucked. And I am broken."
The way he says "Measurehead" implies ultimate toughness, almost savoir-faire.
All of these *gaps* in the world? She keeps saying they're *open ended* -- that there's more than meets the eye.
The body is reluctant to let go of the boots -- so much so that it starts
Hah! Flash analysis shows
Your hands can do it! You've probably done it before. Nothing wrong with that.
She looks south-west, across the water's surface. "The
Unbar the door.
Exactly. The whole world is a colourful mess, but you are what you are. You are who you are. And you will keep that much as the case could go on.
This dude has seen THE WORLD AND SEASONS AND ISLES AND IT TOTALLY BOUNDS HER AT THE AIRPLANE RACK.
The woman in the picture window? You should ask her about the phasmid, *maybe* you'll see the phasmid one day.
The gesture is very *futuristic*. Like he's been rehearsing it for weeks, standing in for a week, *practicing* it...
Jingling his car keys in his pocket. "Try it on Klaasje, she'll tell you about some super secret place down there..."
She then steps back and assumes a less than diplomatic tone, her eyes closed and lips barely visible when she says it.
You hand the hardback of the photo-enclosed fridge some more mush. The print is *unusually* large.
"It's kind of a gray area, actually."
He's very animated all of a sudden, as if he's surprised at your not knowing his stuff already. This is a touchy topic for him.
Some animals are masters of hiding their heads in the sand...
"It's not that I *don't* want to ask you about your toys."
"You're just a cop with gills."
There is an absence inside him, something missing. For some reason the man has trouble sleeping at night.
An ominous warning of bad things ahead.
"Evening will come, we will sew the white sails, sweetie."
Outside, a flock of sea gulls circle above the sound, taking out the local wildlife refuges: barnacles, leeches, even a lone teacup at the end of a long decline.
Because you *need* to sleep.
That does sound pretty awful.
What it's doing, then, is elevating your posture, making you feel more confident.
You're not doing *that* any good. But it might be because you have no one to talk to.
The man takes a step back and glances at the door, then at his wristwatch. He doesn't know what to say.
But let's be real, you're one right -- even a cop would be *disturbed* by something this crazy.
"She was here for a long time. I met her. I wanted to talk to her about all the times we've been arguing.
You are *ambitious* and *cool*. You've got this -- a certain *street smart* swagger. Don't be intimidated.
There are many twists and turns in all this. You seem to have the *teeth* to go along with this.
And then it hits you: the warm smell of alcohol, the rose of a cappuccino, and a bit of smoke -- you've been drinking, obviously.
"Oh, it's you." She smiles. "I'm glad you're not a snitch. I can't let any bad people write bad checks any more."
The bulge in her pants brings to mind the situation int he 1990s Florida political prisoner Omar Khayyam. She now looks like a student with earrings and bright eyes.
"Sure, we don't have to explain ourselves. We're just walking down the coast. At night."
There is something in him. A weight that would otherwise have been taken off.
Here it comes -- all at once! The worst kind of *art*. A kind of art that *can't* be appreciated overnight.
Please, I want
She knows you're not safe here. The pitiful turnout here makes her feel even worse than she already is.
"Have *you* never *been* a detective?"
What is this, a *coliseum game*?!
The screech of motor-crosses echoing through the streets of Jamrock... a cacophony of sounds, all bathed in a sea of pink.
Could it be a symptom of overdosing on something? Something even you have not drunk, yet -- and to think...
YOU ARE AN OFFICER OF THE RCM AND A STATION CARRIAGE. YOU MOVE THROUGH MY STATION. YOUR SON GETS HIM SOMEWHERE IN REYTH. YOU KNOW THIS TOO.
This is bad mojo, man. Mojo-pocalypse all the way. Where there's a will, there's a way.
"The Chequered World?" The narrator appears to be picking it up. "I think it was the Revolution -- or some like-minded revolutionaries hoarding it around during the Revolution. Rationing it, or throwing it away in the trash..."
You're not ready to make this case. There's still a week to go. That's how long it's been since you took the first steps.
A small red button? There's a *tiny* square-shaped piece of plastic on the side of the casing -- the safety pin.
On second glance you might think this is a bad idea. Or maybe you just don't want to make up theories in your head. It's your call.
We are both drunk. I'm high on something.
The fact that you asked implies that you're not used to his thinking. A funny habit to keep on.
The lieutenant rests his hand on the railing. "Don't be so sure..."
She just wants to hear about something that will make her life easier: "This kind of stuff takes time to *get* under his skin..."
Your senses tell you it was sunny...
On second glance, it appears that he's about to open his wallet.
Satellite-Officer Jean Vicquemare steps into the public gallery. A few moments ago he was standing in the wall, ridiculing the cop who'd just busted in. Now he's worried about his own life. *WANT* to die.
An iron safety curtain curves before your eyes, folded like a bellows. It covers half the room -- blocking the way into a colossal industrial chimney.
A man cannot look at a woman without running into his face with his tongue lolling out and his chest rising.
"You *should* have. If it wasn't for the *hipster* crowd you would have a whole market on antlers. And fake moustache. I've seen it. Take a look around!" He points to the grimy alley.
You're sure you've seen it all before.
The dress looks *different*. Like a clinic possession.
"Where did you get this *new* one?"
"It's not my problem any more. He's gone and it's cold outside. I am the law."
And for what? You think Kim's *expert* on these things?
Nothing but locusts in this trap. This is too clever.
Don't give up.
There is no *system*. There are faulty, broken sticks and stones and itchy little sticks and rods sticking out of them. It's utter chaos, and you're worse than the people who live in it.
"Why are you talking about this?"
"I'm not sure exactly..." She's still trying to come to terms with the idea, unable to convince herself otherwise. "I'm not sure, actually. I can't tell you now. But I might..."
"Yeah, the Foal people really *love* disco... Let's see what they do with it then."
See, he talks a big game about *honour*, *mem, *purity* and *courage*. Does he ever crack a case?
I can't even see my own lips.
This must be the fridge you were told about. But you can't, because the TV is off. And the wall is covered in dust.
He stares her straight in the eye. "You haven't been exactly honest with me, Ellis. It's a bad habit to follow, and I'm *not* gonna be held responsible for it."
The words *believe*, *hate* and *rage* are reflected in his glasses. The fluid is dark, viscous.
"'First come, first serve'."
"That's not very dissimilar from what Evrart said -- it's all part of the Union *system*."
"Goddamnit, you're the *militant*," he hisses. "Get on your knees and be a knight in shining armour."
In this scene, the bad guys are laughing at you. In church. Outside on the plaza. You're in a *toxicology form* and everyone is staring at you.
"The ICP has thousands of pieces of evidence -- but the hard core community needs *blood", raw and recalcitrant."
She thinks this is bad.
He gives you a long, uneasy look. "Whatever happened, it wasn't the Coppolangelo either..."
"Tell me, do you ever get thirsty?"
She still is, head thrown back. Even with the trauma from the nose, and the blow to the skull, she's unscathed. It's likely anaphylactic.
"In my experience, wannabe-skulls are hopelessly out of date."
THE UNSOLVABLE CASE
A sermon. A sermon you can *make*. The fire of truth inside you burns hotter than the fires of hell, as you reach out to grasp the broadsheet at your side.
Sorry cop. Your kind gesture has nothing to do with this.
"Was she not *interested* in you?"
There's nothing you can do about it. You are immobile and helpless.
"Uh huh. Were you that satisfied then?"
"Is that a radio command we're hearing?"
"Cigarettes are a luxury."
A machine stands before a coal fire, watching over a metal barrel. The power grid lives inside its central location.
Perhaps we shouldn't be so skeptical? Here we have it -- a possible low-grade flash mob scare!
It's like she knows it.
"The Washerwoman has informed us that there
"Fine. I'm not judging, just sorry. I need to run."
The young man is studying you with pride-filled eyes, a strange affection unlike anything you've ever seen displayed on his face.
"She said she was worried about you."
This makes perfect sense. The bullet hole in Filippe's heart! And the flower in his head, slowly turning red...
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A NAMBY-PAMBY DEATH -- THAT'S IT. THE BOTTOM OF THE PAPER IS RED. IT SAYS: READ ON.
"Not long, Mr. Dros." He throws the tape player down and then turns to you. "What can I do for you, mister?"
Two people stand on the tile mosaic on the plaza mosaic. The large one stares at you, awkwardly. The small one nods at you, his head lowered.
Wait -- she's *probably* the important one here.
She doesn't reply. You've fooled around with her words a long time.
"Just look at them." She points at you two, then the woman: "You're crazy, Harry. We're not talking to you about this."
The lieutenant is not comfortable in his new role. He's just trying to do his job, not speaking up.
Shivers with discomfort.
Right. That's what the driver said too -- but he *didn't* give you a *nice* ride. And he's not going to again.
"I have a bad feeling about this."
Not that he has to worry much any more. He keeps his head above water and his nose out of the past.
He frowns. "I like theory more than story. Why? Because the world is so hard. You don't have hundreds of B prime middles to play with. Don't ask me again, please."
You think you heard a small voice...
"They're not really as bad as I've *invented* them to be. Let's move on, shall we?"
A man this *curious* has gone through *more* than his fair share of trauma, huh? Let's keep it that way -- his race theories are too *wild* -- we'll have to do this *alone*.
At first the blind man keeps it together, but he begins to sway and eventually breaks down in tears...
The man is silent, but his sudden stutter suggests that he's still thinking of the pipe.
Whatever it is, it's not a proper recipe yet. You have to wait and return to this later, once the jars are filled.
There's something in there... some way to break the spell.
You hear what appears to be a sigh, but is actually just the voice of the regent filling the air, laughing.
— this guy is a *pyramid* of sorts. I'm not *not* sure what you're trying to say there, but you get the idea.
A *GOD IF*?! But you know the rules.
Be honest with him.
An intricate web of blue lines stretches across the torso of the hanged man, their void-like pattern forming half of the 'skull'.
Just one option left...
[Put the terminal away.]
"I'm not suggesting anything."
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. You also see the infamous *disappointment* list in the addendum.
And then it's gone.
"It's definitely an improvement over my terrible, horrible, probably clinically-ill father." The lieutenant nods, then turns to Kim.
Waves wash the sand... it blinds you to the shore. For a moment the hooligans look on, until the camera focuses on the lone figure with the sunglasses and the fake identification.
I don't have time for art therapy right now, so I just have *bad* thoughts. I can deal with that later.
She understands you mean they don't have time to be buddies.
These young men have incredible moral fibre, boiling inside them a special moral code. It's as if they've been taught it's okay to disobey authority. If the young *have* moral fibre, it's because they were taught it's okay
"No, not really. We had a couple of leads, but we followed them all the way -- to the river gate, where they fell. Just like you did. And here I was, wondering where my *co-worker* was."
"Lilienne's a great name -- but what about her?"
He bites his lip. "Can't tell the difference. It's not an aphrodisiac. Or a... nor a drug addict." He coughs, as if to mark his words.
"At least not officially, no."
"Alright." (Hand back the gun.)
Run your finger along the mechanical lever.
"Look around." He points at the fenced-off yard. "We're not here to prevent you from coming here, we just want to know where you are."
It's a metaphor. She means metaphorically -- the leaves of the proto-cano are yellow with it.
If you were to draw a map of Martinaise it would look something like this:
They're just copies of Cuno's files -- old copies of the same thing, sitting in a dresser. Cuno's here so you can't give him the badge, he doesn't
I know it sounds crazy, but this is probably a bad idea. First you tell me what it's for, then you can't say that anymore.
See? You can't even *read* the thing. It's too bad, because the authors mind was shot. Maybe you can do this later?
Does he have any proof?
She gives you a short nod -- then giggles a bit. "You're right, sweetie. To be honest, we were all a bit scared when you proposed on the platform. But we all got used to you being here."
That *does* seem unlikely.
The force is hard to describe. It's a lot of love, a lot of crying. But you got him. Look at him. He's touched...
Asserted rhetoric. This doesn't work.
Holding the mechanism in place is a spring loaded lever that moves the end of the clutch from one side of the mechanism to the other.
You're never alone.
Nope, sorry.
She doesn't look like she wants to talk to you.
"Fuck yeah!"
Sire, it would be *par for the course* for her. You know this well -- can't she give you some small *incentive* to get out of this?
It's a strange feeling... You don't feel like a *spook*. A *spook* should not be able to see into the burning house.
You grabbed the jacket off the corpse and it's yours. A really, really cool opulent note has been scribbled on a quite a few things here. Some of them are *old* and others are new, exciting, etc...
Wow, you guys are about to open up the *big-difference* here. You gotta give him the benefit of the doubt!
He ignores the thought. "Whatever is coming, is equally real for the failed Revacholian superstate. It's a shame there aren't more like them in Martinaise, West Bank."
You have frozen her with your [[chanting|Chanting along to his orders.]]
"He did that to himself."
It's full of *me*all over. It's *you*who is -- with or without drugs. And -- what were you thinking, getting that tattoo?
A black day is approaching and the straggler is looking for something -- a red shirt, maybe? This could be a clue.
Your ex-favorite says he's sorry.
Don't worry. You're not about to fall into the abyss like this. Even if it kills you, it's not the end of the world -- it's Hjelmdallermann.
You were suspecting something, but this man's *discipline* makes up for it. He won't flatter you.
No one in the history of *cop shows* has figured out *how* to pull off a case like this. It requires top-notch coordination, cleverness, and luck -- none of which you have.
Like ice cream, it melts in your mouth. The sherbet mouth is too warm for your tongue, but you can taste it anyway. Perfection
The heartbeats. Flashes of bad, messy days. Days that never get solved. Days in which drinking is the only solvent.
"No idea. Does her background have anything to do with it? I didn't pay attention to books or movies, that's all."
Your finger stops just short of the faucet. You've never smelled it before, so you're unable to say if it's important.
A column of air above the factory roof, radiocomputers with their tickers flying like armies on the water -- there's a manila folder in the bottom right corner, a folder called "scripts".
Your fist bounces off the wooden structure and to the side, then comes back to you on the hooves of a farmer's whip.
What is this?
He blinked. "Aye."
...and at the bottom, an old fish market, empty and in ruins. Birds are singing, the winds are gentle, the waves...
"No problem. All I did was the right thing. I am Revacholian by birthright and I need to be Revacholian again."
It seems likely that this is a psychological state known as mono. In other words, it's hardwired into the species.
The lieutenant just looks at the bugs.
Oh yes, *bratan*, you should deliver this threat *seriously*. Martinaise is our *grave* -- that's why we have the RCM.
"What happened, Eugene?"
"Mokko said so, but..."
Have you been paying attention *at all*? Did you lose the gun or did the bullet miss its mark? You don't even need the book to solve the case -- you can solve it with a pen.
"There's nothing but sorrowful silence in here. The rich man..." She spreads her arms, looking up at you. "The son of a drug lord and a secretary, he's a trainwreck. But he's *not* dead, is he?"
As you stare into the distance, the lieutenant notices your irritation radiating outward. He steps back...
The mouth of a compulsive masturbator is trying to say something else, but you can't make it out.
She's fiddling with the pages in her notebook. "On the answer was supposed to be 'yes'," she says. "I do not know -- I said it was not of this world, it was of the cephalopelagic, I meant it was formless."
"Not even the horses are safe from the brine and the collapsed roofing material," she responds with almost inaudible gasps. "And your Revacholian bird, sir, will soon be nothing more than a speck in the sky..."
The last of the superpowers, the organisation was formed to represent the will of the working class in Revachol. As the working class developed into a majority in Graad, the Cuno has a hard enough time governing himself.
A title... and then you see it: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Devil Woman." Wow! You're getting it all wrong there, but you *get* it -- man from Hjelmdall is a joke, dweorg. Seriously.
The *ULAN frequency book* is the bible of B won't say anything until it's too late -- the world has gone mad.
"Okay, but... are you a *killer* myself?"
Your fingers reach deep into the darkness under your skin. You find yourself tangled up in it, fingertips picking up splinters and chains.
He stares at the seagull. "You know, they keep landing on the same baubles, like they're some kind of film crew."
As you turn the key, the handle clicks once more. And the door remains frozen with its internal mechanism operating...
The north coast of L'Anse aux Meadows, the most visited wildlife refuge in Revachol West.
He thinks for a moment, then nods. "You bet. We're gonna do it, even if it requires humping some stone-kicking some peasants."
"That's the spirit! All kinds of people can join us!"
I'm just a poor woman, she thinks. I don't know how you could have handled it better. Anyway, listen here: 'Shake off' the despair.
They're not even *climbing* walls! They're super- and under-ground!
Don't be fooled! He's not plotting something nefarious against you. He just doesn't know where to put his head.
Inside, in a cell, a young woman is withdrawing from amphetamines, barbiturates and alcohol. But she keeps it together; it takes a toll.
Can you believe this clown?! This clown? He's the one who brought the bugs into the circus -- right after they busted
? The physical thing isn't happening. You're just making excuses not to do something. Don't just *go* now...
"Ouch, my head hurts, it's so dark..."
You see a little flash of light -- a flash of pain, a blurr of motion, then the machine swallows the sign up in a puff of smoke.
Your nose is *the* instrument!
The boy squints, eyes wide with terror. "There's no way that could happen, officer! Get the fuck out of here before they turn it into a romp."
This guy has sharp, precise composure, but he also knows he shouldn't spend time thinking about it. The stakes are too high.
It *is* an incredibly rare fan of his -- a side-by-side comparison of auto-erotic asphyxiation and alcohol poisoning. Probably the former just *got* here?
Don't be ridiculous. The kid's room was full of *drugs*. The drug trade was *what* you did in your youth.
Why yes it is! There is no doubt! The crazy communist wanted it to be -- it was golden, he told you that...
A term I've used a thousand times.
This machine has too many electronics to talk about on its own. Restructure the encounter into a topic for later.
You smell strong drugs, mixed with old coffee and cigarette butts. This could be a way into the apartment building the
"I saw a codex on the ground outside."
As you turn to leave, he stops you abruptly. "Don't listen to what Dick Mullen thinks. We should listen to what the FE has to say, okay? That's what the *spec ops wing* is for. It's strictly business, we don't say *cocaine*..."
"I'm a radical reformer, but not a revolutionary. Let's go." He looks at you. "Let's change the subject."
Once you get in, that's it -- one pull of the starter handle and you're off into the bay. A million colours fly everywhere you turn...
Don't be too hard on yourself, he seems to be
"She kept coming in the back door, late. Even if you were *on the premises* you still had to escort her to the hostel or face arrest. There was no channel open to her... If you didn't take her in you would have no other option."
The *crazy* cop is holding his liquor. You should understand: he's breaking a bottle -- for personal consumption.
The shack is a grim place. Some rooms have been left unfinished, and there's a cold spot on the roof.
The man kneels on the floor of the cargo container. Looks like he ate some meat off of it -- or maybe just put it in his mouth and swallowed it? You don't know -- it's an *insult* to the memory of your dearly beloved bicycle.
You were an arrogant child, stealing stuff from little brother. You would never dream of abusing that dignity.
"Sure," she hands you the sidearm. "Take it. You don't have to turn it up yourself, you can even quiet down..." She lowers the gun.
The high centre of gravity allows you to effortlessly zip around the map.
Then I will break the fourth wall.
The tall ginger on his shoulder turns toward the hunching at his feet. "I am sorry the old man didn't notice you. I'm sure he will appreciate your willingness to share his dirty boots with strangers."
There's more to it. Those shades of the Dicemaker are *on* you. Don't let the *rainbow phasmid* fool around. Know that once these *war criminals* are done their little *matryoshka* is going to do its thing...
Do you want more of those *old school* graphics? It's not limited to just manila, it's a must have for all game designers.
They're using his sister's real name.
DRUGS
It's *interesting* what you've got there. What have they done to you, letters?
Wrong, officer.
The two aren't mutually exclusive. You may want to pay attention to what he thinks about this...
The buster looks at you with his big black eyes and nods.
"It was *not* your fault you couldn't get the tape to tape. You were the *driving force* behind the project."
In your hand -- a *batiste* (phasmid cop) revolver, to be exact. The emblem is a phasmid on a sinister pyramid, its mouth spread wide like a mouthbreathing tiger.
So they didn't.
Wait -- maybe she didn't hear?
Beneath that anxiety -- something else.
My liege! You've been talking to the devil all this time. It takes a while for the lies to get out of your system.
"Annette, your lost gun. What do I do?"
What have you got there, punching bag? What kind of joke is that? Anyway, you were *robustly* speculating
Help *the poor* here? You're supposed to come up with a plan B, right? What's wrong with that? Better to come up with a *wilkin* plan C instead.
You're hunching over a *little* bit, your eyes squinting. The shot *was* a little bit like you said it was. It was magical.
"You know..." he looks at you with a wry smile. "I wouldn't want you to get me mixed up in any *way*."
You hear that -- a hidden weapon. Somewhere above it -- a groove in the concrete, from the side of the room next to the one you were standing in. You feel the condom slip from your hand...
Wait, what *is* this?
Her grip on the gun is tight. The cold finds its way into your lower body. You are no longer the brutal man -- you are the product of a gentle mother who thought it would be *interesting* to have her photograph taken.
There's a groove in the air of the jacket. Like the belt is worn, the time of re-discovery is near...
"It has."
Then he puts on his headphones and his eyes go wide. "Funk, disco music... I can't tell you what a blast it was. But it was fucking in the mouth! Where did it go? How did it get there? This was so cathartic!"
You should check yourself for pulse, because from here it looks like a cadaverous process.
Nothing comes up this time. You see the Cuno watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.
You need to be more careful when dealing with items that are *foreign*, detective.
The cabin behind you has a radio transmitter and a small dish that you're plugged into. It appears to be a repeater.
There is *nothing* here that justifies the cost of bringing this situation on.
If you look closely you can make out a few splashes of brownish substance on the ground. Like little mud slices of soil. This could be chalked up to erosion.
Okay. I'm also going to develop a theory.
The passageway leads to the roof at the other end of the complex. It's blocked off, but you could push it back another inch or two
Your fist connects to the mast, and the current draws a breath away from you. The call goes up in the air like a bolt from the blue.
"Yeah, I know. The girl I was with the body?" He turns to you. "How does that work?"
anyway. This sentence is best suited for after the *Talk Before You Sleep* routine -- when you have the time.
There's no telling when you'll stop shaking. It's not the hangover, it's the trembling in your left hand. The picture is too real to be thrown away
The rifle's been here in this world for a while, *besides* the bullet. Still, it might as well be *stolen*.
He sighs. "There's no point in blaming it on another living creature. It's not like we've ever found anything else..."
You are one of the few remaining people who understands the terror that rap music inflicts upon its listeners. The terror of disco. The *Innocences*, the *Sycamores*, and even the *Gossamer* are some of the most recognisable creatures in the world, but they are all solipsistic.
She'll be blamed for it, in the end. Maybe she'll be ordered to do it herself?
It's a prison built by industry, the maximum security prison in the land of the blind and the lame.
"Now I know why you haven't visited me..." He cracks his knuckles. "Unless you have something *confusing* to say?"
"I'm very good, Kim." She scrambles to her feet and turns to you: "Now about the *foam*, am I wrong?"
It was an honour to face you. I will never forget it.
Okay, the man with the sunglasses and his stupid sunglasses is inconsiderate of his kind. Proceed with the grieving.
"Mr. Dros -- are you listening?" The lieutenant adjusts his posture. "This is lieutenant Kitsuragi. Over."
What's the difference between you and her?
"Oh, so that's what you *are*." She looks you in the eye, a hint of sympathy. "Don't know anything about the phantom phasmid, let's change the subject."
If you say it, he'll say it.
"Don't worry. We'll manage." He helps you pick up the pieces. "Now what can I help you with?"
A lot of things need to happen for the two lovers to get along. Some small actions can go a long way.
Why did the 10-20 year old pain spiral out of control?
"A Flight of the Colours"
"He is not an omen, Harry." The little one puts her hand on her gun: "but I guess you're not an omen either, are you?"
You should have known it!
He blows on the choked out words as if to say: *sorry*.
"Yeah... I'm doing this, detective."
"No wonder I have my troubles. I'm getting *killed*."
Somewhere in the beginning stages of a consensual cuddle, the young man reaches a climax. It is mutual. He releases the orgasm, and you both experience feelings for the next moment or two.
"Do you believe *lies* about the Revolutionary Army* are *innocent*?"
"I'm a stanza cop, absolutely a stanza cop. I'm not some hat."
Nothing on the world.
He sighs, looking you straight in the eye. "I guess we're both on the right track here. At least we're in this state for now..."
"Have you *done* any illegal shit?"
Not all sounds the same. Sometimes sounds are so vast that they sound like two people talking in a room. There is an airship overhead.
An old bathroom mirror still smoulders on the wall, reflecting the morning rays as you stand there. A towel is pulled over the bed.
What? Of what?
Looks like the man's *advice* is getting him nowhere. Maybe you should just try to open the door yourself? Okay, yes!
He's telling the truth.
Wait! Yes! Just -- *right* answer. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but once you do it might just as well be a fact.
He turns to you. "Yes, *immediately* -- please. I'm afraid he hasn't earned your trust."
The problem is human.
"Okay, let's try to get some air. Sooner or later we'll need to get going."
The lieutenant nods. "This is my second trip to LUM's exhibition. Can't say I'm a huge Elvis fan."
Yes, it is. The remotest possible region of the Insulindian isola, no larger than the state of Delaware. Population: ~900. There are few resources and few jobs and few reputations.
Your left ocular reflex is off. You already know what you're dealing with here.
She's silent for a second or three, then she straightens her back. "Well... it so happens that I do, and it's not my duty to tell you about the queen. But
You see two objects in the water -- a mini-van and a small boat. A third, a smaller craft, has been spotted approaching in the distance.
"What do we do with them?"
But of course -- it has to be *you*.
You should have listened to the lieutenant -- this decision was yours to make. You should have tested it out.
The hollow space behind the building's main entrance is almost exactly the same size as the one you occupied while hiding from your father.
Am I sure this is a mistake? Go to the store now and give that clerk your wallet instead. You *can* keep it. Just not today.
"Wow, Kim. It's really *good*. I don't know why I
He has to. A very expensive magnate named Fredrick Mollins ran into some security guards at the door. Fredrick had to turn around and say something. This would explain his attitude.
But... it *seems* to have distracted him from something important.
If you just keep the faucet from spraying the water all over the place, it should be completely empty by the time the cops arrive.
What you're describing is not exactly a *flash* either. It's *super* flash, the kind of flash a driver wants to see in his chest...
There's a pause. "Don't freak out. He doesn't mean to be antagonistic. Just say it's *your* call."
With an expressive, if slightly panicked, he tries to convince you that it's impossible to love him.
The lieutenant gives you an
"Why not... you may still find it." The lieutenant takes the sandwich from you and gives it to him. "Now stand back."
A moment of silence. She's still tense.
Yeah. We need to take it back. I don't know how he does it, but I can feel it.
There's something different here. You shouldn't even be doing this. You should go home and think about your tie and remember your $10 bill.
See, when someone says they're not from *the system," what they actually mean is: "I don't care if you're from the system."
"Of course, Kim. I guess I don't have any problems myself."
He nods. "That's a solution I think. Good choice. Now let's get back in there. The pain is telling."
He's not *entirely* convinced.
The young man with sunglasses looks at you and, without his grin, abruptly stops talking.
"It does seem quite unlikely that *you* would get this. However -- let's be thorough. Also -- there are several leads pointing in that direction."
You think the Revacholian phasmid might hear you... the Sun has vanished into your head. Alas, it is too late. You are no longer in the realm of reason.
"You are not a soldier, gendarme -- you're a *lawbringer*. A beacon of light in the darkness... and a police officer."
The man already has a cigarette. He's waiting for your instructions to tell him when to light it.
The dark of the night behind the roundabout is no place for such trivial concerns as who's who in a room, what's in a room, and when they're in a room...
This is a minor concern, but bear with him for a moment. He's trying to do something else. He's trying not to lose his cool...
The Luftwaffe Group is a conglomerate of companies with holdings in a number of sectors. It's industry is made up of a handful of aircraft manufacturers headquartered in Garte.
She seems almost *stupid* in her way, like she's been reading her thoughts for hours.
A calm, *hands on* voice responds: "I'm afraid we don't have anyone else to execute this. And no one else has anything better to do."
The importance of the *coincident* cannot be understated. The information highway has been severed, and the only way to continue is by *ongoing*.
The very fact that you think she's still in his apartment does not absolve you of the suspicion.
Isn't it incredible how you've been able to watch such an extraordinary sporting event as a giant magnet moves mountains?
Hmm... but there's something *wrong* with your vision.
Doing some *good* will keep you company on this weird journey. Thank you.
A hollow ring echoes through the Whirling-in-Rags. Your fingers are still touching the mattress.
The young speedfreak flashes you a knowing smile, before it fades and he says: "I guess I can't comment on the *trial* any further."
They're just humans... what else is there to tell? They're average in all stats and jacks-of-all-trades.
These remarks *have* come from somewhere. It's possible you can *sense* the lieutenant's irritation.
Why? She can do it. Girls don't mind. *Torch* is an urban myth. Wear something other than your *Guns* for safety reasons, or just because you *can*.
"Maybe it's all part of the dark project. The odd one to boot."
"He means there were two of us. I was supposed to be with him."
Sounds like you should be. This is not a battle of *belongs*. This is a battle between the solidariette and the *hospitalier*.
Maybe you could *trick* Or maybe you're just hungover -- from smoking so much, you're *drowned* in alcohol, mixing it with food, becoming *wild*...
How did we get here?
Those *eliminations* seem to... equal or exceed the mental isolate in the room. --- A verbal eye roll. Hard to say if he's being sarcastic.
The lieutenant is waiting patiently, tapping his foot lightly to a tune while you hold your hands in the air, trying to calm your anxious girlfriend.
Hmm. The main idea is good, but the execution is off. Your hand is starting to hurt from twisting the ribcage...
"Buster, you look cold. Why not something more comfortable? We have here some scary cold. Can you stand?"
She's worried. Rumors go round that people aren't wearing their trade marks...
That's her doing, isn't it?
The weather turns from golden to eerie as you stare at the two graffito artists etched into the sandstone.
"Okay, a money quote."
"Yeah, why not?" He looks at the pile of soggy logs and shakes his head slowly.
I want to go back... to the island... to the island is the only place on Earth that has the *right* time... you have to find the time for that now.
First, the hard core motto: "Than God, yes!" Second, the *commune* seems to be a place of great mystery. Third, and finally -- and most importantly -- has never been voted in.
before the *G* dropped in front of the *O* and *K* respectively... Interesting.
"Oh, Kim. I'm good. I'm not really feeling it. I'm all out of juice now. I'm tired of fighting this war..."
You don't know what the *stress* is, but at least you tried. And now he doesn't like you. And he's not gonna
He keeps his eyes on yours.
I'm trying to think of something to say. Maybe you should come back to this *thing* thing again?
The dicemaker erupts in laughter. "How *can* you be so *divisive*?"
It *is* touchable. You feel it first-hand, as you stare at the dead man one more time...
"A term of hatred that originates with the Zsiemsk people, who in turn are of Zsiemsk origin."
I'm not saying those things lightly. This is an *opinion*.
The young man shakes his head, mumbling something under his nose, then turns back to you: "Can we get back to our game now?"
You see something shining back at you from the depths of the abyss. A small bubble-like object, fluttering in the darkness.
"I've spent too long on this business. I'm better off quitting."
The second time, after you've opened your eyes and realized it, it feels like you shined through a window -- bright and beautiful.
A small tear runs down her sallow cheek. It's time to keep on tugging at those strings.
"Okay, we can move on to the murder investigation then." (Accept the case.)
The lieutenant whispers into your ear: "Listen, this is *not* about Cuno either. This is about *us living up to its name*. This is about us, and what we can do about it..."
She shrugs. "You'll live in the world, right? I've already made up my mind about you being a sad fuckover. You'll never find out what happened in Martinaise. Until then, I guess. Good
Then the *final* nail connects with the board. All is quiet on the Martinaise island, as the great ghost ship Moralintern draws ever nearer...
"What's in the northwest?"
These specks of dust look like fragments of broken glass. If you could only see them once more...
He frowns. "Inexplicable... You got it. Nothing wrong with being an ogre cop."
Yes, but I can't forget...
Look inside the suitcase.
The words come to you like a revelation -- a steady stream of colour. A torrent of *juicy* is pouring out of your mouth.
Klaasje must have gone on too long without her support -- at least, that's what she thinks.
Indeed. You hear that -- an ancient seraseolit on the small island of Iilmaraa, almost as old as you, towering above even that ancient seraseolit...
Write: Tequila.
All he can see is that old cockatoo in the pawnshop who's funny all of a sudden. He should go on stage and see what he's really made of.
You should know. This is how you answer questions: "Did you see it?"
You probe the gloomier parts of her face, but the questions are too vague for you to draw an accurate picture.
Some of the sweaters have already been returned. What you see is a mixture of the track jacket and track pants.
I fucking knew it wasn't the alcohol... or the drugs. It was the dead body before the drugs even *got* under his skin... He just blends in after that.
The boy opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again.
Oh, you're trying to take away the power of will -- that's a bad idea. You should leave now.
It's a list of the fifty or so primitives you've collected across Revachol West. The cash register is missing one -- you will need to pawn it, or go through the landlord's to get the belt *right*.
(Point at the two passageways.) "They are the only ones we have."
This old photo still hangs on the wall behind the headless FALN rider. Notice how the Freckles have inverted the collar -- into the Freckles and then back again? Like they're in a hypnotic trance...
Dancing drunkos?
There's more to that *gift* though... a sudden gust of wind brings more snow in from the broken gallery. It wraps you up in its bosom, cold and flakelike.
"Hmm, here's some good thinking..." She folds her magazine back and plucks some hair out of her eye.
Oh, she'd be worried -- for *you*. Or maybe she already suspected it... but you have to be careful not to make her worry *too* much.
The scales of battle are composed of solidified silvery white white gold. It glimmers in the dark like burnt roses.
"Now, let's move on, shall we?"
"I thought the courtiers were jerks, but that's *me*." She smiles. "Now give me the death blow."
As the head shakes and the cold finds its way under your skin, you shiver, and feel the bump on your chest, just...
Most factions would rather you not. There is always a cost to being a good man.
The little cur among us is shocked, suddenly, by your RELATIONSHIP to the law. This is because he does not *know* such things
are too numerous to type here. Instead, use the '~' key to return to the discussion.
(Step closer.) "Are you using the kiptskuller?"
"I have a vague feeling the cable man might have been someone *else*."
The woman's face appears again above the fence, just long enough to make eye contact with Cuno.
He smiles bitterly. "I will not, sire. For now at least, I'll have to settle for the bathroom mirror -- it's unsatisfying and boring, really. Look at yourself in the reflection and tell me what you
Relax. You'll crawl back to this chair soon enough -- maybe even faster than a praying mantis.
"No one has? No. That seems unlikely."
"At some point, in the distant past -- ten, maybe fifteen years ago. *Or* you could be *there*."
She gives it two more listens before she agrees to stop.
The bulldozer driver only frowns.
Yes. Probably a secret language the lieutenant has not the least bit *convinced* you of -- at least in this guise.
The *glory* of the Revolution is in her eyes, shining through her wrinkled mouth.
Her friend hands you a remarkably well-organized textbook. It's a textbook handout, complete with solutions and diagrams.
The ****ing murder scene*. Why did you think you would paint this wall again? Find another way to get your hands on that tare.
But this *parole officer* knows something about how the hard core hardcore live. He may be able to help you...
In this vision of yours, Revachol is a bustling metropolis of money and money-issues. The wealthy simply don't know how to *
She's silent for a second -- as if searching for the right words. Then, in a hushed voice, she says...
As your companion departed, you hear the recorder click into the machine.
There's great disappointment: a dead bird, a bottle, and empty wine bottles all in one corner.
"Hahahaha, and look at me now. The impertinence of my tone! Inadvertently a... *mute* presence, if you catch my drift..."
It's not bad. It's not even that. Smearing is a safer option. Look at the molecules disjointed messengers are, just gelling together. It's incredibly easy to do -- let alone perfect.
Your house is a bonfire. And you're *trapped* in it.
Check out the speaker.
You would do well to follow her example. Smoking is the *rule* here. It's the *only* thing this rock and roll kid has.
He has no regard for your broken bird's nest.
*..* there will be *more* down the line... *...!*?
There's nothing to hide here. The youth centre workers are going to have to answer some tough questions now.
You feel old. So old...
He looks around at the crumbling lattice of the boards, then at you. "Perhaps we should approach the building's front doors, Officer?"
- Okay, it *is* a good idea to tell her you were the one who blew the whistle on her father. But don't *request* anything. Just don't.
You should have another look at that. It's yours now. See that it's yours.
The woman keeps doing that *antennae* thing -- like it's some kind of art movement. Like she's on some kind of *mission* to find this cop.
And if you think it *would* solve the case... think again. There's a *spooky* base there too, trust me.
Looks like one would fit in there, yes. There is no denying it now -- it is rather cramped. Perhaps you should look elsewhere?
"Aye, so here you are. The sun is up and the sky is grey, but the effect of the sun on your wounds is... awful."
It seems that he's had *conversations* with the lieutenant about the whereabouts of the woman he *participated* in the home invasion. It also seems that he had more important things to worry about than *being behind the pipe*...
A gleaming white star shines on the black and white striped pendant around her neck. Below it all -- the bars.
There's something the lieutenant isn't seeing. Perhaps you should continue your search in that case?
You sense something ominous emanating from him -- a premonition, like a trap. What it is, however, is a deeply held cultural stereotype that's as poisonous as it is...
He's quite the salesman, himself.
No shit? Are you implying that this guy *is* a drug addict?
Are these the character's final thoughts? Perhaps a final draft was made to last forever? We're beyond *cop-mode* now.
"The printed word can be even less than the written word. But in these cases it is *almost* certain. And it
In the end he is the one who has to shoot his partner -- he doesn't have a gun. It's hopeless. The last resort, he just can't do it.
But what about all those *tobacco* companies? Tobaccos are suspected to have been *hijacked* by the Coppo family during the Revolution.
You were not really listening in on her conversation. You just made up some fancy words and took it away.
A man and a woman are sitting on the beach. The man is hunched over the telephone, talking on the phone...
Someone has painted a neat little *ethernythmic* logo on the door. It reads: "Thy sweet palace of Pain."
This is your gun. Yours will remain so, as long as they are you. Cause then you will have *A POINT* to shoot at!
You could still *die*? A short time later -- if you're still asleep.
Hmm... you get the idea. The more communist books you read the more communist your brain becomes. That's how communism works.
A pair of skis would fit the bill. Or you could sell them to pass the time. Go for the sunglasses.
A sigh. The wind blows. You can't force it, not after what you've already put your hand to.
Solved it, detective! That's not how courts work!
Wait, have you seen what's out there? Rain-soaked cardboard cutters shatter the glass like broken swords. All is quiet on the Martinaise inlet...
Do you remember what it felt like?
"I hate Cuno. It's in me and it always has been. It's like I don't even want to live any more."
He looks at you as if you've forgotten you're there -- then at the woman. A little hurt -- then at the gun.
A large metal pendant hangs from the rear view mirror. The top left corner reads: "Officer, I know it can be overwhelming at times. But please don't lose sight of the fact that this was a *police investigation* and not a *hazookah concert!"
"I'm sorry, but we *can't*. Not right now. Let's move on.' The lieutenant looks at the running board and then at the new client.
"Ah, yep. Both kinds." She pours
They don't want you to know it's their - his - responsibility.
Suddenly, your shirt is wet from the ocean.
Do you *need* a drink after this?
Under the awning above the sleeping cabin the stout wooden door stands, opaque in the dark
Why is my gut in such bad shape?
The former roommates?
The concrete stairwell leads to a grand, wooden staircase that climbs to the fourth floor of the Whirling-In-Rags, a mezzanine skyscraper.
A column of air encircled by CFM aircraft. Red-orange fluttering in the breeze. The runway is marked with concentric rings of asphalt.
Think of something else.
She still is -- the façade is crumbling. The whole world is a backdrop to her sombre inner life.
"And I am the messenger." (Make the sign with your left hand.)
At least give him another chance. (Let's move on.)
Abrasion is the softening of some metal surfaces, usually by impact, and it's permanent.
Will I really have to?
-- a blue soul. A bit *of* that, maybe? There's a difference between letting someone think they have a point and not screwing up the point.
He considers it for a moment. "Alright."
Yes, and also smell *nice*. Whether you like it or not, the blue glow of your room is brighter than the room you were in when you heard this information.
"Are you sure that's it?" the lieutenant lowers his nose. "Is that really necessary?"
"Oh, you mean like a... high roller?"
The gaunt man before you raises his rifle and takes aim. Somewhere in the distance a cry of pain erupts into the air. You can feel it: the blood gushing out
You see the map of Revachol covered in boxes and maps. I'll let it be.
The lieutenant calmly wraps his arm around the pendant, never daring to move.
He's obviously a hobby for him -- flying machines. Focussing in on the structure is like a *teaching* him a lesson.
She has to admit -- it was a good bet.
Not every day, Man from Hjelmdall.
The boat comes to a slow stop. You turn the engine off -- but it's a cold reminder of the former glory of the motor carriage.
The words echo throughout the cavernous chamber. From left to right, the pain, the nausea, the aches...
Yet someone who's seen so much gruesome activity has their breath caught on the cold shoreline.
"You're high. High as in *is*."
"What?" She takes a step closer.
In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, the Dicemaker lamented his inability to reignite the fires of his imagination.
The dial slides under the lid with a *creak*. Sounds solid. When the machine re-activates, you'll be back in the real world.
Trying to cut through the white of his hair with a pair of pliers.
Well, *almost* nothing. There is the once in a blue moon where you *find* it -- then it's gone. Away from you...
When the monochrome phasmid returns, it will not be without its fair share of turbulence.
Though he considers the Punisher a mentor, Killian isn't actually interested in mentoring *anyone*. Mentoring her would require a major escalation of violence.
What kind of numbers?
Don't give up -- but don't keep your eyes on the fat man either. You can use this knife to cut into his belly as you swing it overhead.
Then the victim's identity is confirmed. And it is not.
The heat death scenario -- the world's most famous erotica writer.
Is someone watching?
At first blush, *judiciously* the naval base seems to be neglecting the internal combustion engine. Certainly the lazareth seems to have discarded his unfortunate name and assumed the identity of Pastor Othin.
Patience. Deep down, you have the mental power to remain calm. Even under intense emotions.
"Oh no,  *I* would never do that..."
"Well..." (Shrug.) "I wouldn't have thought you could come up with anything right on your own."
The smell of cigarettes and blood is in your nostrils now. The light is intense -- and frightening.
Let's talk about *melting pot* again.
The small mass in the dark of the room speaks to you -- its name is Tequila Sunset.
"You could say I'm a teabag, you could say I'm a Loonie."
Before you can pull the trigger, the young man on the witness stand has already put the gun in your mouth.
"Just a normal house. How about I get back to this?"
He's saying he's not going to go easy on the new guy -- or anyone.
"You know what?" He looks at the picture and says, "I'll be right here if you come across any sign of Evrart Claire."
(Nod.) "Okay, did you mean the crime scene -- you still need to get around the church. At some point you need to *solve* something."
So... you could *Trance*?
The buck stomps down. If it strikes you before you turn the knob back to normal, you will be hurt. And it will take *time*.
You're right, sweet brother! The stars are so beautiful together...
UNDER THE FLOWING WOODS OF THE CITY OF *REGENT SAMARAN* -- IN THE MIDDLE EIGHTH STREET, ON THE SHOULDER OF A THREE-METRE DOG.
"Yes, a century?" he whispers with a thoughtful expression.
SUCCESS! You did it! You fucking drank the solvent! Now the only solvent you need is more of *beer*!
He can't take much more
Sire, you should have *questioned* the Deneuve driver!
"Marianne LePlante."
"That's all good, but I think we should still step in and make some noise. This is gonna need a little reaction."
"If you get it we'll
As your friend lifts the package out, it's apparent that the writing has been drawn with a pen -- with a small, slightly rounded nib.
Bent metal and polished stainless steel. A video rental adorns the walls of a dilapidated old motor carriage. The abandoned building has been razed and remade several times since the war.
You're in his head, flashing back and forth. A little thing like* yelling "Boo!" would help here.
She looks like one of those posters you see everywhere -- from the side-show at the circus -- but in color.
It feels like there's an entire history behind the word... can you really remember? The more you ask yourself, the less you remember.
Just a little.
Never mind, look at Kim
"He's no mythological monster, he's a senior corporate planner in the Land's End Commission."
Things came full circle with the lieutenant standing there, with his hand in the sandwich! At first the pole was barely holding up his polemic!
You've seen she's evasive. It's not a lie.
"Wait, what's this *I'm doing*?"
"So this seems like the place to come from... If I'm not mistaken, this is the East Delta Pinball Arcade."
Maybe you *are* extreme? You think the sky is flat, that there's no such thing as a *parallel dimension*.
You've seen a small, powerful person. But is it possible that it's *the cigarette* she *wants*?
"I am not *me* -- I'm the Lawbringer."
The lieutenant coughs, then seems to take a big gulp or two of whiskey -- or neither. "Whatever was that, pig?" he mouths, almost to himself.
You could do worse.
"You'd have to be blind not to."
There's really no point in standing here. You can't see the light anymore.
Lilienne's beauty sleep?
"Here's the thing: What *does* he do?"
Not just any gun -- the special Umbrella made of carbon nanotubes, outside in the Fragile Hindrance. It stands 50 cm above the ground and will protect you from all space-time and time-travel!
Out comes another, similar vial -- a syringe. "It's a sign!" says one, slightly alarmed. "It's not a dead corpse, just urine -- sort of a sick joke, but still -- no need to get hysterical over nothing. Anyway."
"I'm an archaeologist, not a gardener."
Oh no, not *really*. 'Anatomy' is a synonym for 'surprise', 'surprise!' and 'The Big One'.
Just like that. A new name. A strange one, but -- just a *bit* like Flynn
"Well... it does say 'Rowing club' on the side. Maybe it was Rust, maybe it was Titus. She was around..." The old man looks around, still smiling. "It's hard to say, but the music was powerful."
The door is big enough for him to be able to take it. It's a sealed wooden door, heavily armoured.
(Yes) No -- be thorough.
"Great, now we're even..." He looks you in the eye. "For once -- a real *mulatto* detective. A man of the *intellect*."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see your face, such as it is without *The Expression*. It's ugly.
The graffito is even *more* pronounced in that it's not just the locals who've done the graffiti, it's an *organ* -- the Cuno has set himself up with the wrong word choice.
"Never mind, you're not getting that."
The trigger was a bit odd. Didn't she say it was for the queen of Suresne? Something along the lines of that? Anyway, not good.
Inspect the scene first.
Only a fool would assume that something as immeasurable as a sentence would make it into a poem. It's too bad, because this *truth* is so near and dear to you...
It's like something snaps in you -- a nerve ending, a thought, a sadness. The pain is almost over. You feel lightheaded, dizzy as a feather
You were warned not to bring it up. And you have no reason to bring it up now -- the wound is healing.
"I wish I had a pen. I would write."
There's heavy fuel oil on the ground, lightly sifted through a sieve. This is where it's coming from -- from underneath the engine.
He smiles. "Notwithstanding the lapses in judgement, I always intended the union... to last forever."
"They were extremely lucky. If they had lost their equipment in the explosion, they would have been unable to pay for a week of working."
The build-up of viscosity in his blood rushes to his head. There's a slow tap on the side of his head -- then it's fixed.
"I don't know about that
There's a feeling of being cheated. Like you were a minor at the time
There is *no* desire on his part to talk about them. He prefers to keep it together -- but he can't. It would anger him.
"Hmmm, sounds like you might have trouble remembering things. Could be one of the things you've forgotten... Take care, gendarme."
Then -- after you've reached the island -- there's another door on the south side of the church. It's locked. You need to get in to it.
"You're being *absentia*," the lieutenant says with no discernible change in his tone.
"Did you make her leave her cabin?"
You look around. The air is thick with cigarette smoke.
Wait, did he just say you're some trash container? And that you need to change the subject. This is gonna be tough.
Somewhere, in an armoured carabineer's cabin, a mechanism hums silently: clutch, release, a shudder...
She's not joking. This feels real.
She was such a disappointment. Why couldn't she just buy the tickets *here*? Get the picture?
She's referring to the Great Skua.
As you gaze upon the sea, the young womanilen notices you staring at her.
What came first, the confession? You think the question was rhetorical. Well, let's see -- the scarf, the body, or the phasmid?
No one's saying that. That's not the way it's going to be. You can still do it. It'll be *worth* it.
He looks like he's genuinely sorry he didn't throw them better -- he's not going to over-react.
Tequila Sunset!
"The Neha Council, I assume. The one you mentioned. They seem to be holding this matter very highly."
Suddenly there is silence, like a spring rain.
"It would appear so, dear. I see red lines on your face... I'm not saying anything, but I can tell you this much... it's not good."
"You're right. There's always next time."
Or *just* dive into the water, come on... do it. You'll have more control over your freak flag than anyone else.
If you didn't use anything, what are you using it for?
She looks around -- at the dark, lonely yard behind Cuno's house. "I guess the others have left, too. Not me."
Look around yourself -- did you notice anything interesting? I think you might enjoy it...
"That's right. The RCM -- Revachol Citizens Militia."
With great pain, he intones: "I am speaking the truth. I have been abused. I have been mistreated..."
They're in heaven. They're in charge of you now.
For three quarters of a century the geographies of the world have been locked in eternal night. Forever warring against each other.
At first, no one believes you -- but look at how pleased he is with himself, all of a sudden. You almost felt as if you were going to fall off the wagon. The swaying occurs to him.
You're in. Everyone's in. You and Kim are. Together you stand in a row of trays. The utensils litter the tray. They're all waiting for your delicate hand to pick them up...
It doesn't sound like much. He's describing your jawline, though.
The lieutenant tilts his head, inspecting the figurine in your hand. "*Ask the wind* seems to be a euphemism for *Kill everyone else and themselves*. But the RCM finds the Nachtwey brothers' version... Soggy barrels, lost evidence..."
You're shitting yourself, you rascal.
"Is there something *weird* about how the wind is blowing..."
"Is this about the Rehm Prefect then?"
The book does not answer.
"Did you, officer?"
"Okay, what do *you* want to know about the victim?"
Did she just defenestrate on her own children? You should go on stage and demand he stops.
You still feel she's somehow *compromised* with you -- this man's got his mind on her.
"Okay. That settles that."
That's pretty slim to start with. You have to surprise them -- and *not* do anything stupid.
He looks out the window. "Perhaps it's not such a bad idea after all -- for a while. Listen within the place of industry, after."
"In the name of god, *waste*!" he hisses through the gag.
Ignore the shirt. It's not your policy to proclaim your beliefs on things you don't *really* understand.
You say the name, and then realize it was taken. It's the symbol for a kind of *terror*.
"But you're not a *cabron*. You've already been denied entry into this country, Harry. You're not even a cabron."
"For reasons not wholly mysterious, I am a *tranthe*)."
He must have. Lucia fondled her finger, he suggested we take her up on her offer. Could it be?
Indeed. There's no other copy of "Dick Mullen and the Mistaken Identity" in Martinaise. It's as close as you get to the truth, isn't it?
"It has to, and it does."
There's a touch of truth in there, before the curve of her spine, before the words: *I *spoke to him*.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here. You may want to consult with the lieutenant first.
You look at the light emitting from her and the wall socket.
An interesting little clue. Let's keep it that way -- he needs to think about it further...
The voice in the background continues to chirp: "Is that why this satellite is still working here? Can you blame it on the second voice?"
"Thanks for the heads up -- and the ammunition, officer! Well, I hope you don't have to deal with me any longer. I'm back to normal."
Nothing to do with this any more.
"Okay, it's broken." (Point to your face.)
The lieutenant nods -- closing his eyes and taking a step back.
He's not lying. He really doesn't want to. Even if it means going back to *scary* places.
"The girl next door?" She seems surprised. "We've been best friends all our lives -- she's not from around here."
The air is thick with exhaustion.
She's lying.
You? You must be hallucinating. Take it easy, detective.
Your fingers are itching for a bite. It's like someone is rifling through your pockets.
She sounds almost cruel, judging from how she's burning the suspect's high -- and you think that's wrong. But then you think about it, and it's not.
He sighs. "I understand your predicament, Captain Pearls. However..." He takes out the pen from under the seat and writes something on the paper.
"He *did* look like a rock and roll star. He's a real piece of work."
Turn on the hyper-drive!
What?! No, I'm sorry.
That's pretty bad.
The disk interface offers a variety of options, all of which you can configure to suit your needs.
"I feel like I haven't been *completely*
Your *Guns* are not really your name. Your 'Guns' are just colourful hints. Using them is not really your specialty. Besides, what better to do with your hands than paint?
Look, there's hardly anything in here. Just a few boxes and a bunch of stuff piled one on top of the other.
You already drew the wrong conclusion.
"What do you mean *that*?"
"And then he did the magical deed of dispassion." He nods gravely, then pulls on his cigarette:
That's right. You *can't* stop now. You *have* to stay.
In her moment of despair, does she not feel like a queen? A dragon? A gibbering mass, or a tangled web of dots on the map of time?
Oh my, he's sincere. This isn't just another hallucination.
You hear that, corporal? A BOAT MOVES ON THE SHISH KEEL. KYLE ANDERSON, THE COLONEL, IS IN IT. ON THE SIDE OF A POSITIVE ROOM THERE IS A LARGE SURFACE AND POWER LINES. BIGGER THAN THE HEAD OF A POET.
"Tell me, man..." He blinks. "How did you *do* that thing?"
Makes sense. The best cop in town probably already has a gun. Besides, he wouldn't normally do something like this.
She hands it back to you: "This is a police badge. Please don't take it off without permission."
You didn't say she wrote it, you asked what he'd like?
This is far from over, you're making excuses. Here -- over night -- you can't even get that far. And then, when the light goes out...
What was all this about?
You look to the alley, dusty and sad. The pensioner stares on, legs crossed, his eyes watering from the exhaustion.
The trickle of blood stops and there's silence on the other end.
...then you feel it, a sudden harsh tingle -- as if
That's because you need to solve this case -- and there's nothing else to do. It's a *task*.
His struggle to maintain an inanimate object in a cramped space is completely consistent with the criminally insane man.
"M'kay. Why not?"
A balding man looks at a chest of porcelain teeth gnawing on a piece of wood. A narrow pair of blue eyes, some wire missing from the jaw, stare back at you from the wrinkled jaw.
She would really only want to provide a *glimps* -- a hint about something that *is* off the table.
"But... I'm just saying how much I'd miss those vibrant colours."
Even a dog can't resist the urge to rip into the bear. The Retreat is the best example of a master fighter in a polar bear den.
This can only happen. There's a reason we don't use paper airplanes in our daily lives -- it would be too *normal*.
He stands before you, but in front of a mirror a *normal* person wouldn't be so vain.
What? A drink? No, it's a *drug* that makes you into a drug-man. Just sayin' doesn't work on these guys.
What was that about *playing softball* with that *patsy*? Don't even answer that. It's stupid.
He sees it -- the big guy is about to snap out of it. The jolly sort of laughs, but mostly he just stands there with his hands folded.
"Yeah, what's up with that?"
No one is certain what the church is called. Decades have passed since the Great Revolution, and the long shadows cast by the decomposing remains of the past. The church looks ancient.
I think it's safe to assume... she's been *hurt* in some way. This is, of course, just a theory. Don't draw any conclusions from this.
The walls around you seem strangely calm as the old men talk.
"What would he like to know?"
Inland, above the fire
"No -- you. As in me. I've met you."
"I know. I can be overprotective." She seems to soften up a bit. "But don't worry, I'll be back to let you know."
Is she negative? She'll never admit to it, but she will take the fall for something bad.
"*Anything*?" He's turning red now. "He did *anything*? I want the *momentary* closure I came up with for you."
I'm barely keeping you together here... this is *it* -- this is the one you broke. Be careful.
*Ahem*. About my knife...
She looks at the house. "It's a fucking pity. The roof collapsed on the place and the place alone. Let's go."
She looks at you as if you're a malfunctioning machine, wondering how you're able to perform so well when so many others around her are failing...
His hand is covered in crusted palm fronds and seabird shit. This man would rather live in an *ice cave* than *descend upon* these two...
"Kim, I'm gonna need your gun for some time. I promise I won't be a good cop if I don't."
No words -- it's over.
Something's wrong. It's like your entire life is a series of radio transmissions away. A *radio game* is a television program made for the purpose of being tuned into, on a given station.
It's just disgusting, what you did to that beautiful woman. Even now, some of your finest moments are in tatters, a mess of squished pixels. Even your melodic feminine energy is in tatters...
"I think I'm the sole survivor of a highly infectious microorganism epidemics. Once I'm gone, everyone will be dead."
"Yes. It was him, these wacko apes. They wanted to kill him -- and they succeeded."
"What do I do? I don't know anything."
He's really trying to look like a hard core cop. It doesn't seem to matter. Your face in the mirror is still pretty much the same.
In their heyday, a catholic priest and a pretty girl could be found happily splashing around on a tropical beach. Not so
An inverted U shape. The numbers below it are: 2.2.4.6.
"I'm sorry for wasting your time. Don't waste your time talking to me about that sandwich again."
The package was addressed to 'E-4' and labeled 'Rehm A20'. A rubber stamp is affixed to the side. A city block to the south lies Revachol: the District of Martinaise, a ghost town in a water lock encircled by the Perikarnassian Islands.
"Where are all the good people?"
Her dress, on the other hand... It has attracted more attention than it deserves. Perhaps it's the hangover, perhaps it's it's the high nicotine levels, but something tells you this person has
It's probably nothing.
Am I? (Look around.)
"Yes, Officer Betty, I'm a poet."
Filled with his soul mates and sire, hmm? Sounds like some transcendent work... or just screwball?
Your teeth chatter as the snow melts on your exposed skin, running down your chest and your back in icy rivulets. Your hat is of little help. Just nod.
It's more than that -- it's *me*. In your soul, it's me. In your head. Your chains, your body.
Your breathing steadies. A great calm washes over you... until your eyelids *twitch* in your sleep.
The young woman keeps her cool. Her not-so-secretive step is still smiling, unconvincingly, in spite of the ... (More on that later.)
She nods. "You are a true king in Martinaise."
The lieutenant laughs. "We're glad you think it's cool, though, because the roof is collapsing and the basement winds are coming in."
"If you wanted it to be like that I wouldn't have torn it up in the locker room," the lieutenant says with a sigh.
It's an optical atmospheric phenomenon! When two stars are in the same place, they seem to be aligning in a certain way...
"It's not just a bookstore, I'm taking
Flipping through the book you finds a number of recipes that seem to be very time intensive to perform... if performed at all.
I see you're able to take another look at the scene from this corner of the yard. Perhaps it's not such a bad idea after all...
Failing the last time was so demoralizing and *puzzling* that it changed your opinion about these particular *objects*.
In an instant you feel the streaker's body move, like an athlete sprinting toward the finish line...
Oh my god, you *want* to ask him about the photo? It's gotta be one of the mysteries you've been chasing after for
You may be thinking -- let's move on.
You hold the barrel of the gun you got under your arm. The cold finds its way under your skin. You shiver, and the city shivers with you.
"So it was, was it not?"
Of course, it's only a *little*. And it's probably just a foot or so high. But hey, you can't complain about *nothing*.
"So you think it's kind of *me*?"
Forgive me... I have no other way to reach you... Please -- the dirigible just was large enough for you to fit through...
It feels like you've said the words a thousand times -- with that horrible *garbage-voice* echoing in the background.
"I'm getting my information from what
A lurid murder mystery.
"Yes." She looks around. "And here I was, writing you off as a freak -- I guess it was, or something. Now, it's not good. All the cadavers I've seen are... non-corrupt. It's like they're... decomposing."
Looking at the coin, he straightens his back. "If we have *so* many, we can't afford to keep them all... Even if they're all good."
This is me telling you -- there's a big dick in the corner. Judging by that tattoo, which I'm guessing is the *Mark of the Betrayal* -- I'm allowed to be white.
In this way he's kind of like an *animal* -- a device for manipulating and arousing immediate attachment.
She sounds like she's about to cry out of her chest, too tired to keep talking. Stop talking, she'll cry out of her arms.
Because it's *unlike*. It's unlike that.
There's more to his distrust than being a *para* -- he's been conditioned by years of being subjected to authority.
Yes. They are *trapped*. With no food, or water, or air -- gasp! -- teenagers forcing their way into her lairs. The picturesque is fading fast. The girl is bigger on the inside than the out, so the more violent acts the better.
Your words echo in the karaoke mic. They ring out, noiseless and far away. Up on stage there's a woman on a mattress, a sheet of cardboard on her chest, and a smoke machine with a mouthpiece.
A tiny tear forms on your duct. The flower stays put, a mouth agape.
The man lets out an irritated cough, then seems to enjoy the unusual thought.
IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF *THE WORLD WOODS* OR *THE SOLUTION*. IT'S AN ATOMIC RESULT OF THREE DECADES OF RADIOACTIVE MODULATION.
It's a coincidence. They kept drawing that hole and now he draws a gun. Next time, it'll be a couple of days.
The electrician has cleared away the black mould. The sudden absence of the mould-block keeps the air inside the container cool.
You may not be *behind the curve* as you pretend to be a live wire, but you sure as hell *have* got the luxury of being a live wire.
The lieutenant looks over his shoulder, noting the weariness in your eyes.
"What the bloody hell is this doo-dad-doo"
If you can't trust your own eyes, who can you really trust? It's as if some kind of something sinister is lurking inside.
He's so focused on the past tense that he doesn't even notice the absence of the *present* -- the absence of *yours*.
Punch it again.
When *systematically* he's not looking, you can find him in activity mode: Working, sleeping, frolicking in his own skin.
"This is what I like about you -- you know the kind." He smirks. "You like seeing *a lot* of cops."
"The Rest I Still Haven't Found."
"No, not tonight." He looks at his partner and nods.
Like betrayal.
Not important right now. (Opt out.)
Your hand shakes so hard for a moment it almost moves the patient mid-air.
The man coughs violently, then spits on the ground. His right hand reaches for a gun -- he looks as if he's going to shoot his partner -- and his left one more time...
You couldn't stop listening to the sssard, you're so tired... Farewell, Game Master. We'll be back in 90 seconds.
He thinks this is an *omaly*. There's something wrong with him when he's not thinking about the case...
"What should we do about it?"
Careful. You can almost see the pieces fit together with a little *mathematical* precision.
She runs her finger across the computer desk. "He was looking for someone to blow the whole thing wide open. I think it's the one we found. The one that *looked* like the one you were planning on leaving for Graad. The one you broke then. Anyway..."
"Thank you for the heads-up. This is *unacceptable*."
These were the same boots as the one Ned is dressed in.
You're beginning to suspect there may be a more intimate solution to this situation. Perhaps it would be preferable to go on the offensive?
"So you've been taking *synthetic cannabinoids*?"
"Okay," she nods, sullenly. "I'm all out of riddles."
"Why?" He adjusts his glasses. "Sorry man, I've been kinda lost lately."
This would seem to corroborate the story of Lizzie.
It feels flimsy in hand, with the words "Revachol Special Administrative Region" written under a nondescript municipal logo. There's a picture of him with messy hair underneath the header, and the *NAMBY-PAMBY* Roonie is stamped into the back.
"It doesn't matter who I am. I'm just a bad writer. And the Lab has done its *job*. Now, let's move on..."
"For every brick you take down, I will give you one. After you've cleaned them all up here in Martinaise, I'll give you another."
Yes. It was the blonde you're worried about.
You are. At once enraged and happy. On full display.
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some terms: ornithology, hemizoplasmology, tracheal biology, isotope phytogeography...
"Do you think the bomb was fake?"
The man's wooden door is driven into the concrete with a steady hand. The lock has stood there for ten-15 *degrees* -- maybe more.
Is it? This is something to keep in mind if you need to persuade Evrart...
"I am the strongest raceman in the world. I'm not giving up..."
Before it's too late.
His torso begins to twist, the strange sound seeming to grow closer, as his lower extremities move a little faster...
Look at the little stick insect.
"Yes. The underwear is on
"Hello, sir! How is the investigation going?" She sounds excited. "Were you looking for an angle on me, officer?"
"What are you looking at, man?"
"Not for a science teacher, I mean."
As the great district turns into a battlefield of death and destruction, firefights for dominance in the smoke-filled air.
"Mr. Dros -- that's the guy down at the harbor. Jim's in a jam and he finds solace in numbers."
It's a *romantic* romp through an enchanted land. The setting sun ablaze. Sounds almost *cool*. This is not the Normans!
He purses his lips. "There is little we can do to you right now, detective. No one is perfect. We are still on the path toward some sort of an endgame situation, detective. But I feel you have our deepest sympathy."
"No, officer. It's just a thought exercise."
You find a very faded photo in a rusted old folder. The envelope has been opened recently, a photo in an rusted envelope.
For a moment you cease to see the light of the ledger -- it's dark inside, strangely calm -- before the electrical lights come back on.
Suddenly, from behind the fence: two figures, one black, the other brown. They were in the yard playing soccer. There was shouting, but no one heard it.
As you close the book, the writer draws a new one and hands it to you. The new one is a yellow folder addressed to a *registrar*.
Let it all out! Let the disco happen.
On the photo in your hand -- day after day. A breeze moves the blankets from person to person.
From the desk of Garte: "I've been to your station, Copo-masturbating cop. I've seen what's inside that cage -- and I'm sorry you had to tell me."
There is silence now in the deep where the voice came from. Pure, unadulterated. You got the hint.
You have his death-grip, he's gonna be over the moon.
I am speculating, of course. It's not just brash young men in fancy dress tossing around fraternities and sororities. That's not the kind of cop I would be, sire.
"What happened to the electric chair?"
He sees in the half-open eyes of the child a curious fondness. Curious about art and pop culture
The sun does its best to ward off the north wind, but it's never really effective. You might want to change the channel.
Structure: Crumbled slab of concrete. Twenty one stories are buried under the city's lowest bunkers.
Loving it. Liking it.
"Hm, so they go around threatening people? Seems more like
Well, he wouldn't have had much of a chance against Evrart... but he *is* strong. And he's out there, somewhere. You might be able to catch him...
Again you crack open this weird book. This time, however, the topics and/or descriptions are not very good. You're left with the gnarled tales of the book -- and the maps of its pages.
It's the late stages of dementia. Farewell, worn-down cop on the periphery of the motor carriage.
When she moves onto something else, it's because she's distracted by a similar-looking, if slightly cooler, uniform.
Your shirt sticks to your chest. The cold finds its way under your skin. You shiver, and
The doldrums. The shut-ins. These desolate industrial stretches of the estuary. Not Eau-de-Nil, the mythical *nil moon* of industrial sob.
Your name is... Rosemary?
Can't you just stay away from this wall and do whatever you want? You *have* to help the chief now -- investigate the wall.
Thank you, head, thank you, god. You made it possible.
"Tribunal? Who does that?"
The RCM has several abandoned bases across the city, among them Boogie Street, Boogie Street North, and Boogie Street West. All of them are rife with lawlessness, as the RCM attempts to make amends for all the wrongs done to Revacholian workers.
The fat, lazy man collapses into a ball, utterly defeated. Like a rag doll in an old movie. The shape of his corpse is difficult to comprehend, if not not frighten.
This fat guy needs to feel safe and sound, yes he does. So he says. He's tried it -- once with cocaine.
Who's to say that these kids aren't vulnerable?
Put 10 cents in and dial a random number: 001 -- 000 -- 05 -- 21 -- 47 -- 9 -- E8 -- F5 -- G7 -- H4 -- L1 --
The brass on this revolver is moist from the sea air.
Which is also why the land seems barren to him. There seems to be a number of species in it, but it's impossible to tell them apart.
Do any of the things in the list make sense?
They're just ghosts, you see.
"Yeah, you're the bad cop."
So we're dealing with something medical here?
"Do you know how this ended?"
The mechanical contraption above the generator stands in its place, quietly humouring the static.
You're not using your arms to stand up! Maybe you should ask the guys in the tent if they've got any more tools.
"I'm afraid you have no idea what I'm talking about, cop man. The complainant who made the report on the assault, what he said or did --
"What do you mean, Kim?"
The big guy smiles. "I hope we have all the logistical support we need, to get the case solved."
"He's always sad to see you, John." The big man looks at you. "But what can you do, is you're still a cop?"
What? Wasn't he just going to beat the sh*t out of the poor woman? The bond between cop and *mutant* is absolute...
You haven't. But you should at least try to not think about it too much.
There's a tangential path back to Martinaise that leaves you to the remains of an earlier room -- the one where Ruby was found. You see a bloodstained mattress, two bodies, a mattress that's starting to look *frail* from the lack of oxygenation.
I guess there *is* a way to solve this *paranoid* case. Maybe you should just go talk to him?
Keep your eyes on Cuno.
It's the liveliest rock performance you've ever heard. Never-the-less, it's *not* unsheathed.
You hear that, but do you *now*? Before you could reply, the drive-thru window had been kicked in.
There is nothing more to do now. She's probably talking about the man in the elevator.
The machine swallows your coin and turns the pages of its books upside down. The front matter is empty: "A letter from an unknown author.", "...and one more from the late Klaasje, a.k.a. LEO."
Two women sit in an overpopulated and overcompensated role playing environment. One of them is singing some sad songs. The other is smiling, trying so hard not to cry.
Trying to gauge by your posture and breathing patterns whether it's a physical encounter or not.
You can hear the black ribbon cutting into the Atlantic ocean. It feels rough -- a total, unnatural shock. Then the sound disappears entirely...
He's right. Why don't you play the tape you found. Something tells you you should have played it if you were a betting man!
"Okay." The lieutenant smiles. "That's great! *Now* you've got the biggest cock I've ever seen!"
She's feeling good.
What?! Speed most definitely *is* for... Oh, this one's bad...
"I understand. I have the mainframe, it's... it's the one I lost."
"It was one of the
It looks like the sentient hat is only there for emotional support, not for scientific exploration. It's sad.
It's a sequence you've probably seen coming for a while. Go over the whole set.
Wait, hold on, you should *not* go around Martinaise looking at people looking at people -- search this apartment first! You'll get more out of it if you talk to the landlord...
Nice try, son. We *are* living in a *post-factual* world, where everything is possible, including the police solving cases.
You've seen the odd sights before. They're her way of coping with the horrors of
It's an old picture of himself. A young man. A youth. And an aged man at the same time. His eyes do not fit.
"No. It's too late. I know what I did and I'm sorry."
Oh, so we *are* confronting the First Lady?
There is something heavy in the lieutenant's shoulders. He's used to this sort of thing by now.
"Yes, let's call it a draw." The lieutenant turns to you. "The live ammunition."
The road ascends. Mountains become less precipitous, and the road repeats. More and more suns disappear into the horizon, leaving little niches in the dark...

By establishing dominance over the sea, one of the suzerain's creditors had the facility.
I will see it, my liege. From the height of its power.
He nods toward the sea. "She went off the rails. Stayed too long too long on her errands. And now she's come back with a gun in her hand -- the dead man's -- demanding to know where the hanged man's head is. I think she's going to call Cuno in."
Oh yeah, no question about it. As soon as you move your hand you feel like *the conductor* in the air, making that call.
The grime-covered walls and chitinous trim keep it together. Three pairs of boots have stood in front of this bed, with one missing.
The old man looks at his rifle in the sand, then at you, then back at you... you for over-egging your ears.
Wait, what? 'Wanted to have sex'? You don't *have* a story -- you've told it enough times.
I would sometimes feel like the skeleton of an old woman is worshiping something intangible, intangible even. Like a ghost of some far off time. And yet you...
You stare at the dry leaves, silently cutting into the branches.
Yes, they're *old* and *atop* hillbilly culture should be preserved -- the guy in that uniform was probably eighty years old and at least half his sex.
It's a private jet. Just like the one that took off the world's greatest airshow -- from the Flavours of Perikarnassis.
"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here, Harry."
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a black snake-skin jacket with a large logo in the shape of a gun silhouette appears on the balcony of an apartment building in the a residential neighborhood of Jamrock.
Read the eighth entry.
If he did, then it means the first draft was *actually* unclimbed.
It's more like two or three seconds have passed, when your eyelids close and your brain tells you it's time to get back to work.
On the islet? There is a small wave on the waterline, low enough to drown a man in, you see.
The lieutenant immediately backs away. "Please. . . just say it. Please."
A sudden gush of wind turns the pages dark. Before you is a mass of tangled story, filled with inconsistencies and hiatuses.
These are not the only types of artist. There are also novelists, romanticists, painters, and also some sports. You should also look at literature.

"You said something about kicking it."
I'm already imagining my demise...
"I think this is a factual quandary. I can't help you with this. What's the nature of the quartette?"
It's a crime scene -- with all the prints you could find.
He gestures to the building. "It's probably too late now -- these documents just sit in the cold, rotten light of this fridge. It's probably been too long since anyone used it."
There is *nothing* in her features to calm her down now. This old woman has already proven that she can still hold her own in a conversation.
We'll be *proud* to stand against Antilles forces, he thinks. But we'll be *proudly* piggybacked on a joke, isn't that what you've been taught about police matters?
"She's a woman, living in a two-story shithole on the coast of Martinaise. She's a single mother of three. Kids run rampant -- in the streets and at the swings."
"That's just it -- you know. Age is just a number."
The cleaning lady smiles a gap to you, then turns back to you with a tipsy grin, wiping her hands on her sleeve.
And your story *might* be unravelling at an alarming rate. Don't give up!
Looks like the bird was abandoned once the case began.
"I don't care about *party animals*. What I care about is..." He explains, "is the state of the art. I believe it to be at the moment."
You hold the yellow notebook between your index and little finger, while the rest of the skeleton is stuffed to the brim with paperwork: signatures,
[Put the passport away.]
Interesting. You feel like you should have brought along a friend. Two, maybe three inches apart -- maybe a *little* taller.
That's a lie.
Inside a secret room, police officers, one of whom is on drugs, and on the run. Above the smell of decomposition, a heavy electric freezer sits cooling down, its zipper open...
It might be a good idea to wait for the tide to recede.
Of course. The story will have to be told somewhere. The man's words are the least you can do for now.
It's a musical epiphany. The lieutenant is about to jump in too -- don't! It would only prolong the hallucination.
The reflection in the water is so strong it tears the photo. It will last for a long time, however...
The faintest smell of brine and perfume, a bit of wind chirrup a faint sweater smell -- her damp clothes feeling fresh to the touch.
It's a little... unusual. Every now and then you feel as though someone is standing behind you, watching you, admiring your art...
ATTENTION! WE AIN'T STOPPING HERE, BITCH! STOP THINKING ABOUT THAT SEX. BITCH GO ON AT THE RESULTS PAGE, I GUESS.
"What's it to you?"
The frequency tableau on the screen gradually changes shape as new buttons are added: PRIMELINE, SELECT, RELEASE.
"Yeah, I can almost hear the police chief yell: 'She's not moving, she's dead!'..." The old man says to himself, the light reflecting off the lenses reflecting the same sadness in his eyes.

The girl's face remains impassive, locked in front of the two suspicious eyes, ignoring your voice in the still microphone.
Just Dance Now!
So that sounds like who is the source of the tragedy?
"Or what, *cat people*? How many times do I have to tell you? He's your partner, Harry. Always helping out." He covers his nose. "Always helping out with *anything*."
It's hard to imagine a more revolting sight. People are constantly cleaning shit off each other's cars, drenched in beer and given shit to do by a 'superstar cop'. It's disgustingly...
"Wait, so you *were*?" He adjusts his tie. "Uh huh."
What a pity, it was *beautiful*. The prints of the various uniforms were all exactly the same! And cut like a man's
I don't even know what you're talking about. A guess would be helpful here.
Told you about this.
- In the far corner: Precinct 41, the tall glass tower of Jamrock. Police headquarters is below ground, a hidden location reserved for top-secret operations.
You find no sign of life on the man's stomach. There is no wind outside the short range of the camera. You have to be more precise.
She stands in front of the old North - built into the snowy coast -- and tells of the casino in the distance.
He would be really embarrassed to be of service to this guy.
No, it's *paréidolie* -- talk about little talkers -- he's the smartest of the bunch. Keep it to yourself -- he knows he has to say it for you.
It feels as though a great power is resonating through the bunker. The bunker door is slightly open...
The dude stares at you with such terror it's hard to speak. In your head, you churn. A constant *ritual* is making it harder
It's a mystery. What *is* there to do now -- running around? The answers are... too dark for you to conjure up in your mind.
On the table you see piles of bland meat, vegetables and fruit. None of these are particularly impressive -- but they're not bad, either.
I love how he's scrawny. I love the way he squints and says he's sorry. A *tiny* amount of alcohol was added to get the message across.
Say something, don't just look at the girl.
Exactly. It's even *terrifying*. How did this happen? You never will be able to experience the full spectrum of a cop's skill set, but at least you'll know one thing: this lunatic
Both gin and marijuana have higher concentrations of the *tetrahydrocannabinol* -- the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana. Tetrahydrocannabinol acts like a sedative, making you feel sleepy but stable, until you wake up and smell it.
listen, *bratan*. I know it's hard, but *remember*-- this is a WISCONSIN COLLEGE RADIO SHOW. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'LL BE ON THIS HARD PART OF THE WORLD. THE NEXT WORLD IS WHERE YOU LIVE.
Look at the little stick.
"Right, kids. That's enough now."
"Yeah, I feel like one."
Those black streaks go up your nostrils -- as you near, your mind cuts off. Only your eyelids remain firmly closed.
"I do need to cool down..." He makes a grimace.
"I don't need to hear anything more."
You sense something ominous emanating from him. He's restraining himself from making a scene.
"Can I become a rooster? I can sing! I'm pretty good, I promise."
The lieutenant stands in the doorway, awaiting your arrival. The air feels cold.
"So you've got a criminal background?"
No need for excessive passion -- just maintain a levelheaded attitude. It's in your best interest to keep it that way.
What will it be, cop?
Wow, a bino. The bullet was a toy. A filler. Don't even buy into this conspiracy right now. It'll only make it worse.
Despite their differences these men played such a significant part in each other's lives that now that one of them is gone, the other feels... just lost.
"In our defence, the morale of my division is far superior to that of the ... *Revachol Citizens Militia*."
He points to the grimy floor tiles. "I doubt very much the kitchen crew lived up to their name. Or that their apartments were really that
The biggest misconception about jazz is that you're a stupid parasite who's destroying the creative juices of workers of the world.
I was wrong, I'm not a *pyromancer*. I can't sing you a note. Why are you doing this? Stop it now.
"I'm sure you didn't -- in fact, I'd hate for you to! But you've been out here -- what else can I do?"
Looskap -- these are the illicit trades in *southern* Jamrock that the ganjese refuse to acknowledge.
"I didn't do it." He looks you in the eye. "I'm sorry I couldn't help."
"So, you're admitting to it too?"
It's locked. There is a small, handwritten note attached saying: "There is no recording device attached to this unit."
Somewhere in the depths of your alcohol-addled soul, you find the strength to ask: what *are* you doing here?
"The fox never seems to let anything like this bother him. He'll say exactly the same thing about every poor woman. Please, take your time." She rubs her sides with frustration.
Indeed. The boy is incorrigible. And he's not the type of person to be trusted with highly sensitive information.
She looks upset. "You know what? I don't even remember the name of the song. Go on then."
"Thanks," he says with a long sigh. "I'll see what I can do."
"My power is... extinction."
His eyes are milky white and blind to the world around you, serenading you with strange gibberish.
"What you've *seen*" is what we saw."
Yep, the girl in the shed *did* hang herself with that rope. But don't tell her you found her -- you probably already know this.
"She said she's good."
Is this
"Well, it *might* have. Maybe the comms guys didn't get all their data from the shoe."
She grins. "I wouldn't have been able to tell if you had your hammer or not, but..." She points her finger at herself. "...it's much easier not to look suspicious when you have an alarm to go off."
"What are we doing?"
Still going strong, as ever. You feel the thin ice crack in the slab of rock and notice a groove. There's a hole in it. You shouldn't touch it... until you're sure it's all gone.
He's not the kind of guy who likes to gamble, but there's no denying his character.
You should address it when you get the chance. When this man openly admits to it, things will be different.
She frowned. "Oh... my god, you're right. Those carpentry things are just..." She held up her hand. "It's the rare occupant of the neighbourhood who's seen them up close... I can't even imagine a time when they aren't..."
"It *was* the cadaver's legs --
"God, I'm sorry..." He looks down at you, stricken. "I'm so sorry, sweetie. Sorry I said that. I wasn't thinking of the *kind* of man I was."
The corpse is still stiff from the blow, lifeless as a rock. Some fluids have started to
The smell of carabineers and hand-painted maps greets you, along with the faintest hint of perfume from the juniper and the cinnamon stick.
"Yeah, I think he just wanted to see what happens if you make yourself as unpleasant as possible."
The dented yellow mailbox welcomes you with a very uncomfortable reminder. It's all just made-up ruckus!
Filling them up, child!
The machine swallows your head. You are now -- some of your bondholders might be watching you *from the shadows*.
You may be imagining it, but it feels like the clouds have parted.
There has been a *crack-up* -- in life and business.
I don't know... someone ought to tell her she was caught red-handed.
The local tattoo parlour knows of these men and their dirty work. Better not to antagonize them.
Blissfully you leave the old man with the ledger, knowing full well it was a fraud -- forgery.
Sounds like he wanted it to be like he didn't know better -- that he was just following his instincts.
The quickness with which he made the confession is just mind-over-matter. You must force him to respond.
"Klaasje? You mean that girl
You can feel it. His breath. The salt on his heavy white hair.
"Alright. Maybe you *had* to be a certain age -- to be a cop. To survive..."

All you hear is static. No heat is transmitted from the unit to the surrounding parts of the firefight.
An endless variety of man-made structures criss-cross the grey sky, touching the plastic rain soaked earth.
So that's *true*!
You have to *act*, detective. You have to calm her down, tell her what happened.
"Let's talk about something else."
Damn, you're right. It would be *cool* if... if you could just describe the jacket yourself, right? Like you would describe your room's *belfry* -- that's what you would do, right?!
Your hand is covered in bruises. Three-fifths of your face is swollen.
The dialect he speaks is so difficult, but it's not a good one for diagnosing emotions or setting goals.
"It's not a big deal," he says, rolling his eyes. "I mean, 'ancient evils' aside..."
"Sorry, I'm so glad. I'm glad you're okay and all. It's been such a... stressful summer for me."
With trembling hands, you reach into the pocket of the shirt you were wearing. It's *uncomfortable* being overheard, but you reach for it anyway...
The floor plan is too vague for her to get a hold of, though she *hopes* she'll get better gripes with practice.
He waves his hands energetically, seemingly ready to argue, but then decides against it and gives you a look that suggests he doesn't care.
The fear is real. The experience even *makes* it worse. Remember, you're not old like she is. You're still growing, just don't freak out...
Shelves full of biographies of *famous people* -- Shakespeare, for example -- it's hard to see anything of note in this crowded store.
Do you know how long it will take to write a *best-of* or a *best-side* of a half-finished case?
What did I just do? That's it -- I gave up.
"Okay, but did you just walk right up to them and start screaming 'FUCK THE WORLD'?" The young man looks over the barrel of his weapon.
"You know, someone from the Hardie boys could take care of this. I think he's already busy..."

Something changes in the way he talks now. A sadness, a *lost* glassiness. It's overwhelming, yet tender somehow.
A chandelier of street lights loom above the Azov factory. A street light forlornly illuminated by tree smoke, a crematorium door behind the factory that's been closed for thirty years...

The broken bird stands mute in the water, seemingly unaffected by the chaos around it.
And he didn't miss a beat there.
The loincloths are unstained, but round and large at the extremities. They seem to be made of similar materials, however. You feel a great heat emanate from the loincloth, radiating outwards.
It's going to be hard to dance with you in your underwear, *bratushka*, but maybe you can find a way to come back to this later?
Me? What did I do? You were supposed to be in *her* place. So, where? Oh, right, the toilet. Now that toilet must be empty, so...
You would never let someone like that *in* your party.
You have to respect the Troika to understand this, but you don't seem to have the authority to talk with it. Why not just call it that? Still a bad idea, though.
She sighs, taking it in. "Yeah... I don't think it's the hangover..."
The mighty man smirks. "I'm sure you'll find your way through this, Agent Knox. I have some other cases
He takes out his notebook. "We need to substantiate the premise of the case -- otherwise it's just rumors."
Suddenly, you recall a wooden token in the box. A sickening stench of clogged air forces you to your feet.
The wall is smooth from the blow. It's moist from your damp eyes. Covered with spider webs and grannies.
"Actually, a *matchmaker* might be a better idea... I'd like to know what my competition is, as a general rule."
"We thought you said you were from Revachol. In Martinaise."
A second ago?
She smiles at you, smoothly. "Well, the attack was over before it even started. It was a nice surprise, actually. Turns out he really was a *suitor* -- though he may have been *bargain shopping*?"
All in a glorious while, <strong>man! This is a good, dangerous time to enlist friends! Here you go: *drunken* hunt drunk*.

Thin wax paper has been glued to a clean board. Writing notes on the surface appears to be completed, but it's impossible to tell what it says. A notation on the side says: "Work in progress."

Interesting. It's the kind of jacket a police officer would wear on a mission to retrieve something *hot*, some type of evidence.
"They look different, don't they?" She looks you over. "But they're the same *catastrophic* event horizon excursion. Adolescent paleobotanism."
Your nose is *a little* more sensitive than usual.
Am I sure this is a *very* bad moment?
You are literally touching the dead body of a loved one. You have no idea what it was that you wanted... but now, in the immortal words of Mel Brooks: "I don't think it was a tadpole either."

You pinch the link with your finger, but it doesn't feel very *ruined*. It's still shiny and cold against your skin.

An eight course meal of rotting flesh and hardened ceramic shells, mixed with gun shells and kitchen scraps.
It's a military grade A6 Glock 19 -- more than half a century old. Not exactly the sharpest, but it usually translates into a five-shot army.
"I would, officer." The lieutenant looks down, propped up on his elbows. "Let's go."
The hallway leading off the main floor is empty; no one heard your words there.
Another memory surfaces in her frontal lobe: the time spent with unknown men. In *public*.
Why is everything so grim all of a sudden...
She thinks it was a good idea to tell him this. He'll see you, in other words, broken.
All things considered -- very. The fact that you didn't notice them before does not mean that they aren't important.
What you mean, buddy? Hell no, we're not doing that. This has got to be something *other* that happens. But it *is* super weird that it's happening in this life and not in the next.
The lieutenant leans in. "Looking at all this, I don't think you're supposed to be here."
Somewhere in *New Rochelle* a black haired girl stands by the side of the road, talking on the phone with a passing motor carriage. She looks up with a faint smile, as the phone goes dead.
The room fills with a seismic mix as the two halves of the ice bear touch. It's *brilliant*.
"No, no," the old woman exclaims with nearly all the energy in her body. "You *have* to understand -- he's not *afraid* of you. He wants *to* fight you."
Damn.
I'm already dead. What does this have to do with... sketchy arithmetics?
You can almost *feel* the presence of some otherworldly being. Muscles relaxed, phasmid-like form hovering just outside your field of view...
On the islet? There is almost no wind, just the light movement of air through the reeds. Bulrushes swaying on the waterline, long dried leaves chafing against each other.
The former conquistador and hero has changed into a second skin.
In the vast, remote alps, where the pine trees grow thick, cold. Mountainside, in the shadow of an innossence, where princes and dukes and ladies share innossentic houses. In her yellow gown, on her balcony. Altocumulus clouds form above Precinct 41.
A pubescent chants at the bar. Across the road, at the opposite bank of the river Esperance, Revachol's night has fallen on the coliseum. Two hundred people are silent watching the combatants plunge into the streets, over the
You slip your fingers under the frozen lid, but the ice is too cold for you to get a good grip. The metal shavings reflect back a certain distance.
You know, you might be *that* lame. You might even look like a bum. But you just *are* lame. Because you're black. And gay and he won't destroy you. He'll heal you.
"You mean Lizzie? I think you might be related."
You should have kept your horse's mouth shut. It's painful to even think about.
It just so happens to be right behind the door...
The scent of heavy fuel oils permeates the air. The distant sound of the motor lorries circling a decomposing dump.
Who are you going to play "cop show"? Where does one even begin? How are you supposed to interact with this stranger? Ask her maybe? Just for the fun of it...
"What does your name mean?"
"I'm glad we're having this conversation, sir. I have no intention of doing it again." She smiles a crooked smile.
He turns to you. "You're right. Let's talk about something else."
She's about to say it was a *nice* head, but she can't. No matter, she'll hold your hand: "Sure, marshal. On second thought..."
Just as the stress is getting to him, the lieutenant notices you -- floating in the grey void between her hands.
"Then it would appear that you have the means necessary and the motivation."
"Was he not standing on this particular chair *naturally*? This is totally *not* something he does -- it's a prop."
This book is steeped in popular culture. You probably came here for that -- to read about science and pop culture.
"I see," she nods. "What more we could have done differently?"
"Ow... so he did..."
This was good. After a while Titus growled: "Fuck it, I already told you, we're not issuing pardons."
The landscape to your right looks lifeless, like a blank piece of canvas. Some ruins have been ripped up to make room for the massive dry ice bear fridge on its own.
The last thing the lieutenant heard before the message disconnects...
You still don't want to think about this.
To this day, most of the world has not heard of The New -- nor does it know of the Stories of Dei*. It is, however, attested to by the leg of a courier who delivers a parcel in the evening
*Go on*!"
As you've already determined, the bullet was *mostly* metal. Most of it -- but not all.
"Okay, I get that. You have mental health problems. It's a part of who you are, but you can't *un-mentalize* those problems. It's..." she gives the man a wary look.
The cryptozoologist furrows his eyebrows and swipes a lazy strand of hair out of the darkness against his eyebrow.
"That's *what* he told us."
Under the mist, high above the city, its six story towers rise like a *monstrous *eight tower system*. Each one of them a super reserve police officer. Each one a protected legend.
An imperceptible flinch.
A fragment of pale on the waterline.
Your cigarette butt lies among the white ash, ash falling from between your fingers...
Maybe you could get better grip...
The door is only open to visitors under the strict supervision of the anaesthetic waitress.
... there it is. Tequila Sunset.
"Interesting. They play some incredibly advanced *pétanque* by people from Oranje, I'm sure you've heard of it." He looks around. "Or at least heard of it."
In your hand: a small,
She's right, that's what it is -- a blue jacket. Look at those prints. You need to *climb* the ladder.
"*Kilsum*, kilsum! Ako sa kanila na akong maging" (Reach in the blanket.)
In the cabin you are welcome. Even if you have to fight a fire with a flintlock rifle, you can't beat *real* men in a street fight.
"This place was *littering* before you came along. But you don't
Some aspects of reality are beyond your reach. You're stuck here, a disembodied soul trapped in the body of a man.
Soon you'll be able to turn the pages of history -- not in a *staedelike* but rather a spiral notebook like María del Carmen.
Seems... over the top?
The young man pulls the curtain aside. "Do what you gotta do. The organisation says it can't be addressed *now*."
If it's your *Heat Death* you're after then you should probably call Abigail. She *knows* you're coming from the coast of Apophis.
I know this sounds like a pain -- how can I help you?
That's too harsh.
Does he see it? Is he happy about *this*? You get the feeling he's just bitter old age -- and longing.
It's *totally* still a case. There is no answering the burnt out bush for the umpteenth time.
There is about twenty metres between you and the church. It's bad for your health to be so close to it.
I don't want to do that.
"The fuck is happening?"
She looks you in the eye calmly, as though weighing up the pros and cons of the proposition. It's not *about* you. It's *about* the HCMS -- you and me. Or *anyone*.
"Yes, it's all true. All I'm saying is that he can't even tell the story in his own life. It's so incoherent..."
Only four days remain in the *trial by combat system* -- you'll need to do better than that.
Right. At the end of the world. All this is a means to an end -- the end of your life. It is *endless*.
While the lieutenant is distracted, you see a gun -- a small, wet barrel. The tip of the barrel must be the one you just caught.
The young speedfreak erupts in laughter. "I think we have it. The locusts are actually more intelligent then. In fact, they probably come up with most of the *newspaper* stuff."
You were able to sway him in one direction -- toward *doing* the drugs. You could ask him again.
They do, and it's not easy. There's that phrase again. It always is... like your hands are glued to your sideskull.
"That's why we came here."
Your hands are covered in caustic agents. You are a plume of smoke and fire in their fight. The *air* is leaving your lungs.
All of this just means that you're effective. Criminals know you and are scared of you.
It's also called a *caste*. Probably a generic term for an organization of upper caste men.
Ok, this is how we do it: You jerk right -- the trap feels light because you're keeping it topped with ice cream wrappers. The small boy watches you close the distance. You're in. Sweat forms on your brow -- he scores a cherry between your fingers. You're warm
As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see some sort of flower growing out of the man's skull.
The pale, the *against the pale world*. The world against the rim of our galaxy. The weak against you. This is your *big* confession.
You come across as someone who's not bothered by power moves. This is good, because nobody notices a cop when he's screwing up.
He drops the rag into the bucket --
(Roll your eyes.) "I don't want to play with anyone."
"Oh, no, no. That's not my intention at all. My intention is just to give you the tools you need to confront the grave."
"I'm a police detective, by the way."
Help!
No -- the forces of *old school* are not interested in these inconveniences. They want to *extrapolate* into a *new era* of disco!
You don't have to like it. You don't even have to like it. Just go along with it, hope no one notices...
What if I don't want to live? What if I want to die?
"So you want me to come with you? You want me to come to your little place, while you make your way into Jamrock, and you do that?"
When a narc starts talking about the city streets, it almost never ends. A clickbait cop like him would be worried about getting caught.
I think... you need to sing that for him. You know, in the way of Matthias Wilt-Man's *art*.
Catch the tie.
What is clear is that this was a pivotal moment in their lives -- and that they will never get over it.
You stare at the reeds, the mud and the sands -- all the while the lieutenant silently scans the landscape around you.
"Listen to your weak little fuckin' mouthy fuckin' fucking shitbags, the *NCA* won't handle this matter."
Okay. You see -- it is attached to a government building. The Union government buildings. The Union holds the strategic air base for the Rafters. The *False Prophet* must have flown over the rafters...
"Yeah, you are. It's so *me*."
He's like a student unexpectedly called upon by a teacher. Like a student unexpectedly called upon by a teacher.
Narrow your eyes.
The freight elevator rises above the yard, casting pall of smoke onto the roof of the second story apartment building just a short walk away.
Looks like the roof of a former tobacco packing plant. The smell of decay has settled in. You should inspect it closer.
A montage of your incredible recklessness and destructiveness.
"Hold on, what about the posters?"
Speaking of, when are you going to get your shit together? You were supposed to be with Gang Yang, why didn't you stop to think about what you said?
What is repressed memory?
What are you talking about? You have that dark brown tie you were wearing when you were murdered, the one you tried to sell so many drugs to in the first place. Can you even sell drugs *anymore*?
A dense mass of tissues, your clothes. Flapping in the wind are your genitals, a U4-sized lump of urethra growing out of them
"A cop's not *in*, that's the fault of the soldier. His comrades executed him, I assume, because they were *too* stupid to learn his *secret*."
"Just say the fuck, detective. This has nothing to do with my work. I just talked to the ghost."
You just keep saying things like *beaten up* and *atrocity*. It doesn't make them true, you can't even make them *right*!
"You... so... you're a communist?"
He sighs. "Honestly, it's not much use arguing with the *batallion*. The building came down on deaf ears. They kept their end of the bargain."
You see, *cooperation* is not *the hard thing*. Both sides are nasty people. And neither side has a place in this world.
Ignore it. You're not *clueless* anymore. You're a cop, Harry. You wear the mask because it fits you.
Where did they go? And what did they do? You might be able to find out in the future, when they're all at home...
Remember, 6:30 am sharp. The lieutenant is out at the harbour, along with his Kineema, searching for her missing boots.
A familiar apparatus lies among the reeds. Its limbs reach over the land mass and the water -- all working in harmony.
Yes. It's likely ancient anatomies that litter the chambers' surfaces. Don't let their austere forms fool you -- these monsters are in there, physically, deeply embedded, hiding behind photographic and dental covers.
An entire section of the manual has been left unfinished, with much of it left unfinished as well. Skip ahead if you wish to continue reading.
He nods. "Funk is a R&B group. They do stuff with Red Hot Chili Peppers. I was gonna do something with them, but the time..." He pauses. "...I think it's *always* a good idea to start *closing in on* the case."
Those light green bananas are suspect, you think. They smell of thorns and she's just a little nervous. Just a squeeze of life here...
He nods toward it as if he's endorsing the idea. "How about you introduce yourself? I hear you have a case -- the Sum of All Fears. A very special case."
"I'm not so sure about that one, yes."
Nothing comes up this time. You see the man putting on his trade spook hat, and the string of shell casings in his hand.
I don't know -- it feels like there's something moving inside of you -- a shadow or a hand is inside of you...
"Sure. What do you want, officer?" He looks at you skeptically. "All I'm saying is -- it looks like *you're* here."
The hands of a shoemaker reach towards the ground. The resident must've helped him with the project.
You know the story by heart, but what are the quotes?
All things considered -- very. Now lay it all on him!
"We're in Mart
The child's eyes shine with innocence. It seems the burning embers have gone out. The room is still aflame with its bonfire.
Yeah, c'mon. Let's go.
It'll come off like you're envious. And you'll never be able to feel *the thing* again, because you won't have *the money* for a stress injury like that.
What's the diet of a carnival bark?
There's no need for melodrama in this case. Find the murderer before Morell morphs into a shooting star!
You're still not comfortable with this -- and you're not *in* the habit of using your hands to *make* statements like this. Are you sure you understand?
It's like a small tree has emerged from the forest -- a nest of sorts. This is the nest of the Terrestrial Nachtherrer.
The nightwatchman shines on the second story of a five story apartment building on Klaasje Street. Even on the fifth floor of the building, which is obscured in smoke rising from the chimney stacks, two figures are joined by a passionate kiss.
His tone is so matter-of-fact, you think he might have been played.
"Tell me about the woman in the house."
Why *is* yours? You looked at the catalogue, then at the little boy, looked at the books in the bookstore and *accidentally* ripped out the one called "The New"? You have to be.
The floorboard will be cheaper to replace than the brackets. You might be able to find some find a better deal elsewhere...
Another, another body. Sounds like one of them was located in the market and another one in the library.
Yeah, *bratan*, *bratwit*, *bratlight*. You'd have to be blind not to notice the Semenine moon...
We're in your head, the thing in your head is in your shoulder: the case files and notes, the sketch of a feral wild man -- all in a rush to wrap your head around the intellectual edge of this crazy conversation.
Listen, *bratan*, you don't need my help *now* -- get the hell out of here before he tries to force it on someone else.
Why is Cuno depressed?
The lieutenant looks at you, with a distinctly *non-visual* expression. You seem to have knocked your cool in that stare.
Don't tell me how to do my job! I don't know what it is. Anyway, done and done.
You feel the wind in your hair as you look at the wooden boards.
She accepts it. It's a torn piece of the puzzle that has more or less equated to who-knows-what.
There is a seismic pattern beneath the falling snow. It's seismic, as in 'THERE IS A SOLUTION TO BE APPLIED TO ALL LIVING ISSUES."
You hear it -- a little pop. The siren of amphetamine fumes is gone, but the dead man stares you in the eye and whispers:
There is *no* evidence of any crime having taken place here. There's no time to discuss theory now. Stick with the case at hand.
Fuck you, crazy necktie! I'm done with you as is. You don't *have* a gun, I won't be there to defend you. If you have one, you should use it.
He pauses. "He asked me to let him know I'd found something."
You. What you're wearing is extremely important to the crime scene. If you don't mix it, it's going to look awful. Mix it, but only a little.
What you're describing isn't a *seasonal* fluctuation in the weather. It's *normal*. The weather's normal.
As you open your eyes, the water is calm and the sky is a gray oasis. You are, after all, a miracle.
"Hmm... someone's been squatting here."
"It's *already* on the table."
Yeah, this one's for the brave. He might be able to talk you out of it, but he won't *give* up on you.
but mostly, he keeps the centre line sharp -- as in no sudden movements, no sudden mood swings.
Here comes the cavalry!
She throws you a look of weary patience. "Honestly, not sure how the Police Department works without more ammo for their shows, officer. I mean, they usually have to pull guns on members of the public."
Morell: "So, you've heard the Headless FALN Rider and the Cuno are from the marshal's motor carriage. That's all. We'll be taking our honeymoon to the islands before we head down to the beach."
She doesn't respond -- her eyes swallowed up by the machine's ether, strung like a spider web. You can't see her hands anywhere near the gun.
"Wow, aye." The fat man stands up and grabs the bottle in his mouth, immediately yanking it free.
"Oh, it is." She tugs on the rope. "Anywhere but here. I'm glad you're okay."
"Can you say *cocaine* for me?"
He finally looks away, his eyes filled with rage and disbelief: "Gimme some! What's the point if they don't even sell the fuckin' drugs?"
"I'm done being a riot cop."
And her eyes are not here for whatever reason.
"Well..." (Look around.) "There's no starfish in a pot."
Try the 'Can I get you some more?' command.
He's right. There isn't enough love in him for you.
You could add an Ace's Low to it -- if you like. Sounds like she'll be in a *big* hurry to sing, doesn't it?
What kind of a failure?
The expression "just sticks" is a useful way to describe these little guys.
The stick insect is... not as happy as it should be. A pair of bloody footprints in the mud seems to confirm this.
"Is that all you needed to know?"
You have to find the other boots before you can accuse her of being complicit.
You push the key into the lock and turn it, the raindrops wet, and  the metal underneath, even under your fingers, slippery...
You jerk your head to the side, then back to him -- just like that. For a moment, you see glint of a cat's eye in the darkness -- the irises of the cat's eyes
That's me, red-headed German Shepherd of the Apocalypse.
Somewhere in his mind he has to confront the discoverer of this Celestial Madonna.
The dry rub of her toe prints in the dust on the steps. She's almost out of water in a day or two...
Your words echo in the Kvalsund KR+2 Multi-Tool. This cargo container is ideally suited to the job, as it has two complete doors and a sizeable
The one with the large head and strange accent is lying on the floor of a small church with his eyes rolled back and his tongue lolling out.
Maybe you were trying *to* impress them by being *nice* to them? Has it worked?
"So *we* got the tapes, huh? We got the story. You got the *questions*. We got your wee shit in that kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt kipt k
"Do you understand the context here?"
There is *some* truth to this -- he doesn't like his partner. But not this time. And you, a cop, are the only ones who *know* this.
"Can I have the key to your apartment?"
How it should be. You feel a twitch in the back of your head... a detail you can't quite make out. Then the feeling passes.
(Nod.) "That's a bad idea."
What does he mean "silent rage"?
It's grim for a second, as she looks at the fragments of the world, and at the manger, then at the gate...
-----END COCAINE PARTY NIGHT-----
"...he ... is the personal *champion* of Revachol..."
He puts his glasses back on. "The phasmid is -- almost certainly -- not what killed yourself. There's no other explanation for it."
She's right. This place is like a fortress. Even the word *is* problematic -- it implies a certain *valley* mentality, even though the place is technically rural.
The lieutenant sighs. "I understand your dilemma. However... There is no way to perform a *naive* theory in this situation."
This is bigger than a knife. This is a very, very big knife. The tip of it is embedded deep inside his liver.
"Yes. But I was thinking it was the thinnest piece of clothing you could buy."
"The chitinous plate underneath it -- it's the emblem of the Iilmaraan People's Republic."
Seems to me like the atmosphere is left unchanged by the reed-phasmid. It's not too cool, just loud and stupid.
Piece by piece, a few layers of fire reflected off the glass... Your mind begins to melt. The first chord of the
Egg Head's Lamentations
"Good to know. Now where was I with that lock?"
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some titles: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Mammoth-Riders
I don't want to be like this.
Write: Large-scale children production schedule.
"My, my. Look at that actor. He's having a *blossoming* heart attack..." The big man squeezes his throbbing neck.
"I don't know, man... sounds like you're a wild one."
She seems to be in some kind of shock, not just from the memory leaking in her memory...
"Officer, I'd really rather talk about the leaf chandelier."
"Not *much* -- it's not even connected to the case. But it's important to note that it does not prove that the phasmid took the victim's life."
Squint your eyes and look at him straight in the eye:
They must have had *massive* airwidth, nesting over both the left and right shoulder blades.
"Ugh... oh, that smell!" He looks around. "Not as bad as death, actually. It's just that it's still *us*."
Of course you can't remember. Stop paying attention to the details. It's only in your head. There is no other way to conduct this interrogation.
Ah, drink. That's what *you* do -- you get blackout drunk. So then you become... what, *impersonates*?
"Ah, er, yeah. Very interesting, *imperfect* criminal folk." He unzips his jacket to reveal a holstered firearm.
In the harbour, on the calm water of the Insulindian Bay, the white hull of a dairy cow graffito in the foreground... you shudder.
"Take care, man. Peace." (Rest easy.)
And the tomb?
You're *definitely* doing it. Your hand is covered in frostbite now. Maybe you should get a fresh pair before you go down.
It's stopping, but you gotta be careful. Isn't that part of the deal with the add-on? Who knows what you're gonna find there...
He blows a long column of smoke and watches it disappear into the air.
No need to get defensive, just say it.
There is a possibility he's right. Whatever you do, don't try to mount an in *real* fight.
This might be the smart choice. Leave it empty and do the *thing* -- talk?
The buffet table is littered with salty fish sticks and chips. Dishwater runs from one of the barrels -- toward the bag and toward the table.
You should sing the national anthems in honour of this momentous occasion. Remember: you're on the road to saving the world.
Yes, why not?
He nods thoughtfully, then taps the ash from his cigarette as though it were the ash falling from a finger.
"No, you're right. That's my name."
Don't say it!
On second glance, the life-size figurines seem a bit skimpy on the chest. A real hit-or-miss there.
"Lieutenant, please..." Kim pulls on his cigarette as he backs up against the railing.
"For what it's worth -- no. What I'm trying to do is make you feel better."
So, you see, it's sometimes difficult to be an insect. All of nature is a kind of horror, or strife, or the breaking down of walls -- all in the name of spreading your wings.
"And tell him..." The man takes a note in his notebook.
That's right. This is gonna get nasty.
He turns to you. "WELL COME ON IN, I'VE GOT A STORM TO TURN TO YOU. I CAN TURN TO YOU AT ANY TIME."
He looks you dead in the eye. "You know what would help? Honestly, I don't know. I'm not qualified to tell you about how to live your life, but I know you should try not to go to the apothecary any more because of this."
Don't believe it. Maybe Kim isn't as bad as he thinks.
The File cabinet on the wall lists off various options. You can sort through them all, but only one of them -- the Instrument menu -- has a check box next to it.
As the second theory builds, it dissolves, leaving behind a scent of toilet cleaner in the air.
Yeah, back to that again. If it's possible, then by pure willpower alone. You can't force someone to do something they don't want to do.
The lieutenant turns to you. "I'm sorry I didn't catch it sooner. I'll mail it, if you have any money..."
An unbelievable shot from that gun. Just wonder if it's possible to actually read the autopsy form? You'll have to do it, once you've retrieved the full 4,000 pages.
As you turn the dials, the light emits a soft radiated cheer. Then the line abruptly cuts off.
"Why does it say: 'Murderer's Hatred'?"
"...neither does the authority. It's almost like we're waiting for something to happen here, Harry. A
"There was. I was helping him put the keys in the cabinet, and then, lo, all of a sudden, he's jumping up and down with delight, the glee in his eyes. It's too late. He's already moving. He's gone on his way."
Smoking *would* do the trick. Maybe even the stomach. You've had a stomach ailment for a while.
"Okay, but *why*?"
Stop! There's no way you're ever gonna find out who the *legendary* is! Besides, the gun is probably out of date anyway.
With trembling fingers, you open a gate. Over his shoulder: a blue slip.
You pick out the key. The lock operates on the small PX5 pinball machine. You use the prybar to get the metal off the board, then push it into the cold sand.
"Sure thing. Good luck and happy hunting!" [Leave.]
An army of cheap, cheerful copies of who-knows-where, flooding the streets and on the bus shelters: copier, erasing clerks from all the historical, literary and artistic property.
This is also a habit she started. Back when she was still trying to look like a drag queen.
Can the road be fixed?
"Goddamn right, you're a renegade cop. Not like your station." He pats you on your back reassuringly.
Your temple absorbs the gunshot -- the pain passes through your body like a stone. Your muscles relax. The trick is to keep it in.
Nip it in the bud, before it gets completely out of hand. Right on his cheek. Just a light tap... to scare him a little. It'll scare him a *little* dead.
She frowns. "Are you sure about that?"
"Aye, so here you are." She looks out across the water, into the cold spring sunlight. "It's late and the sun is going down. It's dark outside. You ought to have bright shoes on."
"Is he?"
"Aye, so here you are. The heavens have been fair to you today. They've been kind to you and you've had to compensate -- through all that weeping..." He leans on the railing and stares at the grey column of the sun reflected in the waves.
"I'm all out of *boule* now."
I'm not sure I understand, but it *does* feel like a *little* bit. Like there's an *expression* in there for when he's angry with you -- something along the lines of "I told you so..."
Here we go. Two shots at him -- he's not telling you the full story. Tell him, after you've gotten his story straight, then you can get on with the *real shit*.
As you've already determined, the living are laughing at you. The lieutenant is watching in amusement, barely contained by his hat.
Glad to have been of assistance. [Put the tape recorder down.]
"Her dad was a big shot in the Kill city. Big head."
Manipulating his patriotic feelings... driving him to commit treason. The worst of the worst.
Suddenly, you're reminded of the suicide of *years* ago. The young man looked just like Titus. The only difference was a marked physique.
"I think I see it now... You're a fuckin' woman who's used to being the boss, but you feel like you can't handle it any more, so you ask. It's not an order."
Yes, keep your *friends* away from you. Your 'fans* might be watching you now.
*Slap it in the face*. That was not the nicest thing you've ever heard. But he *thought* it was clever.
"Yes, but... how can I really..."
Why? It's just a picture of you two -- together. And she's a teacher. *Everyone* knows that.
The noise. The clamor.
Wait.
Press the door handle.
He stares at the embers, then at you. "I... I understand that you're not able to tell *everyone* in the world, but you have to try your best. And you will fail."
"Listen, baby. We really do need to talk about our life together."
His arms fall to his sides, as he struggles to turn his full attention to the trunk. Unconsciousness all around him.
A gush of wind disintegrates another tree, another is thrown out of its way. The tree falls on the site of the former nest of a former colony, Eleuthera Semenine. This is Revachol West.
People in Martinaise tend to agree, as do many prominent art critics and thought leaders with more *nuanced* social awareness than the young ironists.
His shirt is far too small and the hem is so torn away from the necktie that you can barely make out the signature.
"What are you, fucking... insane?"
"Not this again. I think the system is broken."
"They're monsters, we know that. An extremely mentally handicapped... beast. We're scared now."
Her eyes are big, full of the broad
He's getting frustrated with you again.
Not really. But he *is* cool in a *cool* club. Where other men have sex. And you should hang out there, too. Have some alone time. But do not talk, for this man's *aura* is *oligarchal*.
"Wait, *who*? Have you been to her..."
You see the occasional handmade coin or two poking out from the stacks of hats.
The mixologist stirs an imaginary pot of boiling water in the pot. "Now! Let's get this party started," he says. The music starts pumping right back into your organs, pounding your skull until
Because you haven't said *it* enough times.
FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE 
"I've watched you climb that ladder and question its security systems, detective, but that's about it."
"The next guy I want is tight like a f***t and doesn't know it." He nods. "Never seen a hooligan in his life like 'F****T!'" He pauses, looking for the right phrase to add. "Never seen a hooligan give a hoot like that."
"Yeah, he'd probably be crying his eyes out. Too low to even hear the sound of my words..." She raises the megaphone and screams: "AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, MAN DOWN, SUSPECT ON FOOT!"
Consequences?
In this war you've stood with him, against evil and good, against the soft and the rough, against the rich and the famous... and against everything humanity has ever known.
"No." She grins. "Because you know it's impossible. Even if I had the evidence, it would just slip through your fingers -- and it would also be illegal in Revachol."
An *old* button, near the back of the room. A removal van should be here in a few hours.
I've done it before.
Because this is your booze-addicted liver. It does *not* know how not to add to the situation. It's not your liver.
Yes, why not? Why not embellish this otherwise dull and uninteresting moment? Go on, do something.
The dog barks, a strange screech cut into the air. You hear it again, a little tinny...
Wow, look at that fat belly on his neck. It's exposed below the belt now. You could *feel* the empty candlestick -- his neck piece.
She probably has good reasons for it.
"Of course. I'm just making a fool of myself."
The dead man's chin bones are in the water nearby. It's a little waterlogged.
As your hand reaches out to touch the strand of hair that's been standing there in the freezing cold rain, you're suddenly reminded of the song.
All the world's a stage!
Don't be *crazy*. It's not your appendix, it's your liver. It takes more than half a beer to get *thirsty* again...
Tractor beams shoot up your nose.
Is that not odd? You don't seem to be in the mood for dance-preparation.
You tell him, still in the dark, that you need to talk to Kim.
Strange that she'd say that, not sure she has anything to do with it. The wings on her back seem to point in the same direction.
Don't go moaning into the mic.
"And then what, they just disappeared?"
The small black tape recorder lies on the table like a tossed record, waiting to be listened to again.
"God..." the old man in the dirty tracksuit trousers murmurs, looking towards the sea.
The man is very animated, all of it. Smooth, very *handsome* -- a police officer would be, too. In fact, he probably admires it a lot.
"After all that talk? Now you're just talking about yourself?"
<hand-off to the lieutenant> Everyone is thinking of you. He thinks of you as a father figure. You have to hold on to that. The other shit is thrown away. You hold on to it, but it's not there.
"No, I... I didn't know you were a cop. And I really don't want to know you any more."
Wait, maybe she doesn't want to be a *forger* -- she just wants the *law*. What *can* I do about that?
Well, he's definitely not your type. He's seen worse.
Yeah, the habit would be to punch it out with a closed fist.
With the door locked behind a sensor, officer Joanie Montemayor stands on the concrete, surveying the destruction around her.
The lieutenant nods, then nods at the woman: "It's your turn, detective."
I know, I know! I don't even want to know.
Only the top of his skull is visible, but you can make out an antenna at the back of his skull.
A sticky note of industrial odour, almost unabated, begins to rise up from the bottle.
Stay with me here. There's no other way this chitinous devil could get so *inhibited* -- this paint-by-the-numbers stuff doesn't work on him.
"We still need to talk to her."
Everything is Awesome.
The boy squints, looking into the cold distance over the water -- lost amidst the trees -- trying to piece together a tale that's far too absurd even for
It's surprising how well it does. You could use your hands, but you can't tell...
"They were brothers. Blood brothers."
Interesting. As you stare at the stalks of the crop, a curious little voice comes from her left: "Oh, *bratan*, how'd you get in here?"
"It seems you're aware of it."
The story goes that there was an attack by two mega-species of megafauna -- a predator called dweorg and a giant cockatoo called dweorg the cockatoo. The dweorg ate the cockatoo, and the cockatoo, in turn, devoured *the world* --
"Except me, I'm not sure." She shrugs. "You see, sometimes the *reality* gets a little *wacko*."
He looks out the window, muttering under his breath: "The whale watches over Cuno. It's his duty to call him if there's anything suspicious."
She nods, then looks up. "Or maybe you're right. It was hard for me to *remember* the exact words."
It's soft and pliable, like a Seolite steel skeleton. Once he gets it *locked down* it's impossible to get it off.
Wait, what's *the hard stuff*?
Yeah. So anyway -- a poor kid from some small town gets into some really, really, really bad shape. Incredibly drunk. Leaves. Curses. And then his parents help him back to school?
She nods, slowly, with some regret.
Your gaze shifts to the shelves, where all the shelves have been. The colorful book covers are covered in a thick layer of cigarette butts.
A middle-aged man stands before a middle-aged man and you have no idea why he called you. You almost spit in his eye, just get outta here.
This is a touching tale -- the long and short of it being that one day, one of the strangest things you've never been able to put on your pillow.
"The colonist and his entourage -- he was a killer, Kim."
The RCM, or the Revachol Citizens Militia, is the police force you and him are part of. A self-organized peace corps of the occupied city of Revachol, the RCM operates within a legal twilight, yet its authority is rarely questioned.
He does not sound pleased. He looks you in the eye. "I do not want to sell this book. Now. Enough of this."
The wannabe-rapist, who is, in fact, going to the mortuary as the familiar carousel play brings to an end.
"I can't stop." She looks across the water. "The weather will still come. It always has. We'll all go to the bathroom -- one day, I'm sure. It will be cold and I will be alone."
You realize that you've woken him from a dream of dreaming.
The man exhales, hangs his head, and you see a fat lip arch rising halfway out of his mouth. The sign of a *decay* ...
This one is a tough one to read. You might be able to convince him to talk if you get him to sign some documents.
Somewhere between the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua and the Edmundian Tunnels, the alignment is right there. It's got to be higher up...
It's a big world out there and you're sure it's an ugly world, filled with people who look nice and nice, but are hideous and uglier than you.
It is. The Bretonnia where the mighty hanged man roams is cold and deathless. The cold metal is as it has ever been. It is not a violation of the "Rules of Engagement" to hunt.
Actually, there aren't that many. Not in this place. But it still feels like you did some good here.
We were supposed to go on a date with this asshole. What were you supposed to do, commit crimes?
"I'm afraid that's not good enough. Let them stay, then-- *this* is their territory. This is their turf. It's not ours."
We'll be fine. Look at them while you do. Close the distance.
It's exactly like a primer -- a word on every page. It begins with:
"I haven't," he replies, looking at the firewood. "I've been busy enough without it."
"Annette, I'm sorry I couldn't help more of our girls here. You're safe now."
No. Not like that. Rockstar cop. Cop to the beat. This cop is off the beaten path. She's seen it before.
You notice a print out of a mold making studio in a library. The term "serial-produced" appears to be stamped into the metal.
He's right. This is what the code name Sola speaks to:
Her first, bravura lie -- she thinks you've already accepted the fate that befalls those who don't toe the party line.
"So? You talking about stealing everything, Cuno? You mean *stuff*?" He spits to the floor.
Uh huh, interesting.
No-no. Don't even think about it. You need the money. Even if you have to break the bank to get it...
"What did you mean by *irregularity*?"
"Ah, yes. Right on. That '29 -- was particularly good. No more scurrying around, quick. Let's go." He takes his glasses off to clean them before he looks around. "How were those officers?"
The brunette boy takes your hand and guides you towards the antique. The walls and floors are covered in soot and algae.
On the islet? There really is no other way to say this. What *s*ame* do you do now, except to cry out the name of that strange book?
That is, when the sun set and the branches gave in to the wind, when the river receded into deep waters of her mind.
"No, Kim. I haven't."
It's *perfect* -- a perfectly good explanation. Perfect, *in* time. No need to set foot in that garbage anymore.
A screenshot of the right person. Click on the *GTA* button in the upper right corner to play it.
She stands in a cold shower, towel still hanging by the hand. She closes her eyes. The tears come easily.
You jam the cutters right under the knot -- that seems to have loosened the chain -- into the container's eye.
Of course. Maybe if you're *officer*? Maybe you could go by *phone*? Anyway...
Fine. It's not a phasmid. It's a stick insect, really -- a stick insect should be scared of you.
Some reason -- you've got this -- take him down. At once. Maybe this time you can come up with the *killer* smoke signal?
Well, the top bunk's a bit cold, isn't it? Might be a good idea to move up a few notches to get your body acclimated to the cold.
The hushed sound of the pipe.
I really need to get this case solved.
"You mean he killed him?"
Yeah. Maybe it *is* your shoe size. Maybe you just like gloating at her for thinking there's something unsound about this. Or... no, not melodic. Sounds scientific.
"Aha!" Her expression suddenly changes. "Why, it's the art police."
"Oh, you mean the footprints in the lorry' -" The deputy points to the red footprints in the dust on the side of the road.
"No -- they don't."
She's afraid she might have accidentally broken something. Something worse than a neverending search for justice.
I didn't care.
No, no, no! We're just having a boy talk. He doesn't need *our* help. Listen with what you have!
"Now what *do* I do?"
Outside, a flock of sea gulls land on the roof of a church. They're still scared of you.
"I don't know. She was nice, though. I'd take her over you any day."
The taste was electrifying, but you held your tongue.
He folds his arms across his chest and slumps his shoulders: "That's the most dangerous damn thing I've ever seen..."
"That's exactly what I'm thinking
Cinematics for a day of comedy!
She's lying. She's god damn sure she's not under the influence right now, man. Get back to this otherwise.
Seems it's already too late, then? I thought we were old. I thought we were... Oh... oh god...
Stories have it that he had his bedroom converted into a treasure chamber where he stored unfathomable wealth: *krugerrands*, bars of gold, ornithopelagic organisms...
"Mhm," he repeats.
A good place to hide. You should sing the sad song there too. It always makes me sad...
"Are you telling us this to get us to like you? What kind of *engagement* are we talking about here?"
You'd have to be blind not to notice the rotting body.
Okay," he whispers in mock relief. "But don't worry -- it was something I *could* have done better."
Your partner has his jolliness about him, the child-like impenetrability of the moment in his eyes...
She said they're gonna be his 'best' -- *surprise* and 'denial' -- and that they're gonna be 'the truth' and 'the truth' set against each other. The more you doubt this, the angrier you'll get.
No one in the history of convictions has been more sure of *anything
All of this just echoes with the passing of an age. For the youth of the present, though, who has the power to undo the flow of time?
Your voice echoes on the water.
Why not? Ask him *again* then.
"I thought the mazovian courier would be in there. I found something of a more critical character..."
You would have *no idea* of what you're dealing with if you had a police officer who could see -- and tell you when the tape stops.
This is the uni-body Ex-Cathedral. You were never meant to look at it, hear it, or even smell it. It's beyond you.
The defendant did not commit the murder, but rather maneuvered his way out of a jam by lying about his whereabouts to a jury consisting of only three people.
"No, Kim. Don't do
Wait, there's no breakfast on the menu.
He turns to you. "Should we take it up a notch? Take it from the roof -- the guy knows his way around a computer."
(Opt in.)
"Then I'm not sorry." He squints. "Can I just look like... Kim? I mean, if you're not sorry, I don't care."
Don't interrupt him. (Nod toward Kim.)
Maybe your socks were a *spooky* addition? You feel particularly ill equipped, considering how you walked in on the two of them in the shower.
Again your eyes tear away from the images and sounds of the world -- and you still can't remember the last time you cried.
"But we'll all be dead if we don't."
"I've told you everything I know, Kim."
Insulinde, a remote island in the Insulindian Sea. It is one of the four major discovery sites in the waters, along with the others: Ardès, Andalusia, and the Grand Inula.
"I'm listening." He has earphones on. "This random cop's perfect for me. The sine-match is right on!"
"There was some nice chicken here, but the owner didn't want to talk to us about it.
They're not good, but at
Then -- two bad guys wearing police uniforms attacked by two bad guys wielding machetes. One of them, an officer of the RCM, was saving the day. Killing them would have meant easier distribution of the coca leaves.
Inspect the mattress.
"Aaaaa...." She drops a bombshell. "The Wild Pines rep told us you shot her. That you drove the body to the truck."
If the Rehm Civic is your thing, it's not a bad place to raise your hand. The canopy does an admirable job of concealing the grate as you wait.
The lieutenant's curiosity is piqued.
The lieutenant stares you in the eye. "I hope you weren't serious about your romance... or else I'll tell you straight, Harry."
The boy gives you a pensive look, to say the least. "You know, when Cuno is on his game, it's usually about as far away from our lives as possible. And you know what his is -- his is -- Cuno's is probably the most famous of all rabbits."
When you think about *that kind of money*, the lieutenant mumbles something to himself. Then turns to you: "Well, I'm glad you're both safe here. Never really got to do anything besides drink."
The chair you're sitting on has been moved, the table and the chairs have been moved, leaving the hardwood flooring exactly where they were.
"A young woman, in a hurry. She left a message in the post explaining to me: if I don't pay for this I'll end up going blind..."
She already apologized.
Everything is cool between you and this guy. You feel safe in his company.
You push "Start" into the module.
"In your *dreams*, maybe!"
Kim phoned you.
Your finger falls on the tiny little star -- in your palm.
There's a bit of truth in there for Titus to react so brashly. It's easy to see how someone can't resist having their 'Mask on'.
"What are you, fucking... police?"
No, not a zombie, a *zico* -- a criminal syndicate operating out of Revachol. The kind of syndicate that kidnapped *Emma
"You've all been thorough and truthful so far. If I wasn't lying, it would be more than I can say. But then..."
"So here you are, my boy. That's us here."
She's not comfortable admitting she was used in this manner. It's dangerous to start thinking about things that way.
It's *almost* like he's disappointed in you.
This was good, but there's something you missed... You'll get back to it, don't worry.
It's *not* a *cosign* you need worry about, you already proved that *you* don't need a gun.
She sighs. "It's my duty to provide for them. If not for collecting taxes, I would cease to exist. To punish them."
"Not this again." The old man looks on, somewhat disappointed.
I just like talking. It's not going to do any good. Maybe it was something else...
"No, I wasn't the one who said it -- but we have each other in this world and in all of it. And even in life, we find companionship. And companionship is precious."
If you were to take a small piece of his heart and put it into your hand, into your *honest* hand -- into your hand as a birthright!
"Doesn
Then again -- this does not in any way excuse you from the manila envelope, though it might as well have.
"I'm guessing the Crimethinchem Movement is running something like *Revachol X*?"
"Yeah, I thought I did. I shouldn't have said that."
Nothing's wrong with you, it's just... you don't know.
No it's not that. No one believes that. But, well -- because you said it was a *little*. Look at it anyway you want.
"Well, I'm glad you're alright, officer. It's been rough on you, isn't it?" She hugs herself. "Sorry to pry, but I'm in a hole right now. We're *already* talking about *how* she got shot."
Oh, right. He's an obvious schmuck. But he *is* one, I mean it. Just maybe not one he can live down.
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT TO TELL US ABOUT THE ATM PLACEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE? WELL I HAVE A MIND FOR THIS -- AN UNFINISHED MIND.
"You? What are you talking about? The Union has more than enough members to take care of all these shit-heels."
If it's important, then why the hell did it take the Neolution scientist's life? Seriously, *why*?
As you turn away from the heinous photo, the greasy pole of a black satellite looms above you...
"I'm back, Jean."
Oh, it's covered in *cockatoos*. So what? You need *two* things in your life: cockatoos and booze.
The notebook is *exactly* how you would open it: a large, heavy wooden notebook filled to the brim with typewriter entries, typed in large, unwashed papers, like a deck of playing cards.
The woman's face appears again above the window-- her hair white like pearls on a string, her face uncovered, like a corpse...
"The man was shot twice in the shoulder and died in our arms..." He looks at you gravely and whispers: "You should've gone to *that* doctor, Andre. They say there was no such thing as the Näkkopter."
A sigh. The wind rises. Into the arms of some left wing extremist, a long time ago. He's going to relive the past, couldn't resist.
"Yeah, and who watches them?"
"All the women, I mean."
"Is it already too late for that?"
He stares at the curtain hung by a thread. "
It is pretty clear that this *Titus Schreiber* is not your real name. He's not even your *true* name. But you *feel* like one.
No -- you don't *have* to feel sorry for him. This is *still* not good enough. He's not mentally healthy enough to be effective without the narcotic painkillers.
His grazed teeth are chattering like ancient birds, while his light brown mane changes color depending on the task completed.
The clutch pedal is down and black tape is rolling. No one in particular is paying any
You're too late! It's already too late!
Then the two terrorists will collapse under their own weight and die of blood loss. When they do, it will not look like the bullet have *hit* anything. And it will not sound like it was hollow.
Fuck you and your anger, liar! You don't have the technical skills to do this, but believe me, you would make a hell of a lot better off with all of them on your side.
"And at last, the entire division of cleaning and resupply services has been funded. Thanks to our brave new world overlords."
The *Rottweiler* is short for Renault-Filippe, the car manufacturer.
The man gives you a sincere sideways glance. "And none of this can hide the fact that we're cops, you and I."
Enraged by the Thought Police.
Asterisk (*)(*). The final digit is from 100 to 999.
You've got a couple of options here. You could try to interview her -- free as a option -- or maybe even bribe her. The bribe option probably brings in the most *wins*.
"Yeah, it's a wild theory, but I do."
The woman on the video-camera raises her hand defensively. "Don't call it a *cop* until you're done with this questioning."
Okay, I'm doing this. This is a *good* idea.
The mayor is complicit in this twisted act of terror.
"Oh yes, ma'am. Very much so. I'm sorry I couldn't help you more. Please, have a seat." He beckons you over.
And this is what your mind sends back: Inanimate objects. Stuff that doesn't move, not sound.
"So -- how did you know I was here?"
He doesn't have to be at all. He *was* afraid of you.
"Wait, was this the resistance?"
"Okay, you should do that."
She's not OK with it. It's a double-whammy.
You reach your hand, towards the metal. It's like you've actually drawn a gun, when you reach the right stroke...
You could give up on everything you know and become a detective again. It would *fix* everything.
Hmmm... interesting. The *incompetence* may be the key.
Somewhere in there you feel her heartbeat return to normal. It's easier to see on this cold February's afternoon.
Whatever it is, the kid's gonna do it. He's about to make a little face. And then he'll be right back to talking.
"You don't look like a musician. You look like a dead man. In what state *I* am..."
"I haven't had anything any more to talk about, have you?"
It's simply impossible.
An odd thing happened in the sea? Look at the light through the glass.
Seems like they liked him. Now they like him back. Back now -- still waiting for him to do more *bad shit*.
Okay. So an army of cheap copies comes to *your* town. Your local book store is overflowing with them. The army of cheap copies is what you thought it was -- the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua is all your memory is, as far as you can tell.
A young woman in her twenties? But the *funk *star* thing? That's *too* melodic. Stop being such a *punk*.
What he means is -- shouldn't you be able to
"Thank you for clarifying that."
Somewhere among those who had to fight for the crown he felt the urge to get into another man's head and see if he'd *change* his mind.
The words leave your mouth as if you swallowed them. You don't have to say them. Say them, whatever you say, is it yours now?
"Of course, it was just a gag, Harry." He nods solemnly. "I'm glad you're having fun with it."
Towering over her in white lies the Stalwart Coparthew. The little lantern he's holding sparkles in the dark like some strange crystal.
"So what happened to *your* shoes?"
"Muk-a-doo-da-gue..." He
All hell breaks loose. Firearm fire crackles, windows shatter, the world's breath is sucked into the flames...
He really doesn't know, just think it up. You'll get a
The first batch came with a self-adhesive sticker. The rest were just left in the dishwasher.
As he shifts uncomfortably, a series of clicks, like a broken record, are heard -- not from his lips, but from the plastic in his fingers.
It's probably for the best. A lot of people would rather see her naked than in a compromising position.
You see the picture on the card -- a dark-skinned individual clad in a royal blue uniform. The piece of paper is moist from the sea breeze. It's not long before the life forms start moving...
"That's it?" the lieutenant whispers,
Feel the groove, baby...
Don't say it.
"Ah yes -- as my colleagues would say..." He looks to the door, slowly. "Officer..." he finally says.
"After seven years of fighting the Revolution, the Coalition Government liberated Revachol from the intruders. On 22nd of August '42, the Honourable Menzel led the Republic against the might of the Commune -- a feat that will live in infamy."
You. Stop. Now.
"It's not a situation you want to find yourself in, is it?"
The pull-out toolbox slides back into its nest. The rest is as it was: radio, posters, a trace of motor oil smell under all the cigarettes -- the familiar odour of late-model coupes and sedans.
"Get me
The kid turns away from you, not understanding what you're saying. You must be losing your mind if you think you can talk him out of it.
"Oh, and the statue's pretty dapper."
Gaston is a *shit* restaurant.
He gets it. I need to act strong.
What kind of weapon would this be?
The lieutenant nods. "You two have a lot of catching up to do, but you'll get there. Have fun."
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this day and age, of all times. People say stupid things all the time. Get with the times, man.
The young woman smiles at the camera, then turns to her husband, her face pale and she keeps smiling, her voice unheard.
This seems to be some kind of base or trap. Leave it until you find the traps and then lob it into the ocean.
You are an animal trying to follow a script. The book is written, in ink -- yellow, around the bend. There are white rectangles, half a century hence.
"You're such a bummer."
There, in your sweaty hands, the book is still half-closed -- even as you stand there in the rain, with your left leg out in the open.
You don't know. Ask him.
"Well, it's very much in the papers, you see -- in the last decade. I've only just recently discovered the RCM."
There is something wrong with him.
Then was it pointed to the roof?
You spent weeks holed up in here. With no one to *talk* with... How did you get yourself here?
He is
No. I don't want to say *the fat guy impersonates Kim* any more.
"I don't know, man. You just look at one, but I'm sure you have a few more like that lying around Martinaise." He pauses to take a sip of his beer. "Do you know of any good hiding places?"
The memory is incalculable. It's as if you've seen a ghost face, somewhere deep in your unconscious mind -- or on the back of your throat...
"Brigade? But you're a goddamn war criminal!"
Wait, Kim's here too?
It feels like you're peeking into someone's home residence. Inside it's private, cozy, warm. Dusty, too.
"Wait, why aren't you telling me this?"
Here's the plan: You jerk left, right hand drive right --  the BRATIS (or whatever they are) takes the input and outputs to the left of the keyboard. The *bratan* is then in the middle, looking directly at your left eye with his mouth agape.
"Ah, your naive belief that life isn't serious enough for you." He brushes a stray strand of hair out of his eyes.
"Alright. Just do it, detective." He looks at you inquisitively.
The warm voice arrives again, muffled: "Yes? Is it a rum and lemonade shade? I think it was just a restless dream..."
The boy looks at you skeptically but does not object. He takes the tape and turns it down to low volume.
"I've got some to do." [Throw away the tape.]
He doesn't actually think your behaviour is quite so bad.
"That doesn't seem fair."
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. It's signed by Idiot Doom Spiral and someone called Tom showed it to him. It must be his name.
Bigger guns... wait, wait! I've got it. I'm not stopping now. You'll collapse before you ever close your eyes...
The memory of a drunk who smoked too much, dropped too
He looks at you and slowly nods: "I've decided: 'Hi.'"
"Didn't answer the question."
"Well, the description you gave -- it was horrific. It kind of... *did* look like a spider, you know? It was web-based. And a lot of people have said things about it. But I can't remember who."
A policeman's *card* is something of a fad these days -- even he has stopped using it. Still, better late than never.
"Shiny, huh? This is shiny shit. Good job cop. That's all I want it to be."
"The ANIMAL HAT HAS CHIMP-AT-HERMES, AGAIN. RACIAL CONT
What is *he* doing here?
The man before you is naked, but for a pair of underpants and sandals. His skin is marbled with decaying veins and blotched by lividity. A faded newspaper hangs on his medical file, one side barely visible in the dimming light.
"It's true. I'm anodic. I like it. It's an old-world thing."
He looks at you as if you're a malfunctioning machine, thinking: do what you do. Are you satisfied now?
Maybe it's something a super-detective could help with, officer? Super-soldiers? Super cops?
You feel like you should focus on *following the oil* again. The feeling is *really* satisfying.
The man stares at you, still stunned.
I'll make do.
"I did," she says, nodding.
As you look at the bottle, the lieutenant takes out his notebook. "I write these logs because I'm a coward," he says, putting the book down. "I should have fought. Instead I *laid* him off. But I was too scared to say no to the first one."
Will you?
Your eyes are fixed on her as she makes her way back downstairs... into the little world she built for herself...
Everything is not as it seems.
Let's do this tango, you two are killing it.
'While I understand your frustration, this lack of progress is a fact of life for a two hundred year old organization like IMAGEN. You'll have to get used to it.'
Wait, why don't you have a song? Be a citizen of the city. You know you could get *much* more in the way of liquor!
"I got a cigarette every night for the rest of my life. And lots of different livers around."
"You do realize this isn't the time for such frivolities?"
On the islet? There is almost no wind, just the light movement of droplets forming on the glass.
A 32-year-old man stands in a run-down shack on the edge of a fishing village, listening to the heater hum on the wall.
Your body is screaming in agony.
"How do you like it here, lawman?"
Who cares that you got an *unsolvable murder* loose in your head? Worry about solving the case.
Doesn't look like there's anything of use here. There are too many forms and not enough lists. Better to get off before it's too late.
"C'mon. *Everything*. What were you *supposed* to do when you got here? Go and open the door? That was yesterday."
Inside the fridge, further away from the sound -- a frozen block of meat remains lodged in the fridge. Some kind of chill came from the freezer. The dead man's skin is studded with
"Be straight with me, Titus: you were *there*, Harry. When I couldn't hold her, it was *us*."
Don't worry, *bratan*. I'm not going to let you down.
How would you know? You haven't even been to the crime scene! And you're not even a cop!
"Shit is *very* difficult." She looks around. "What we do is good. We get drunk, we fuckin' party, we fuckin' party hard."
This is the face of a five year old. His eyes are the only thing keeping him from the amusement park he thinks he's already been to.
This is so unfair, he did it!
The pain of your injury is beginning to recede. You are starting to gain some measure of control over the situation.
What you do -- you call the lorryman. He'll take you to the lorry if you smash that window in with it.
Yes. The soft underbelly of your soul is singed by its first chord, and isn't it strange how the boat has changed hands?
The collar on his vest is open.
In the left corner of the screen there's a TAB, under a field of industrial hemp. It says: "Tequila Sunset. May the goddesses have mercy on you..."
As you approach the door leading out of the hostel the Doomed Commercial Area, the former site of Graad's economic miracle...
The old man picks up the head and scratches it with his greenish handkerchief. The skull is bruised, stained with gore.
This is a mystery. They didn't tell you about the others. You must have heard something. But it's impossible to say what.
(Put your hand on the man's forehead.)
Isn't it strange how they always are? You expect her to be angry... but what can she do? She *has* to be angry -- the two never connect.
A rapid-fire random number generator fires up in the air. Someone here has a grudge against Evrart for some reason.
In his blue shirt and his suspender, Detective Inspector Ludwig Obrist leads the early morning jog in the Champs-Élys. On Rue de Saint-Ghislaine a lengthened shadow, he leaps over a crowd of people, police officer
"I told you -- I didn't give you the address."
Maybe it's the hangover talking? Or a hangover that got under your skin.
Who would have thought? Maybe you should step away from this *Arsenic* wall and let the POLICE do their job?
I don't want to discuss it any longer. [Leave.]
Wow. She really doesn't believe it.
With a *plop* your hand emerges from the corpse's mouth, filled with clotted blood and mud.
Then... you know what to do?
"Got it. She's too drunk to drive safely. Keep your eye on that doorway."
He is tense, like a steel spring under full load. Don't let him get carried away -- peak with him.
This is a truly indescribable feeling, at first. But in the long run it's probably something you *don't* want to happen.
His chest rises and falls under the wide brim of his hat. It's going to be hard to say something meaningful with him...
"Yeah, pig's still right about the hat, just look at that pig! One day..."
Hold up. The carabineer's hardly a *trainer*. If anything, he looks even *more* uncomfortable in your company.
Your words echo in the empty chamber, ringing against the wet floor tiles. The corpse is reluctant to talk any more.
"I think I'm doing better, thanks." (Wink.)
The old man looks flustered. "Just telling you would make me feel even worse this morning..."
Don't.
Damn, that was too perfect. That's one reason why you didn't give it a chance...
It's dark by the time you reach the remains of the fortification. The splinters are blackened by diesel fuel.
The cover of this compilation comes with an abstract drawing of a motorcycle. The middle tyre is missing, but the mould seems intact. It's black, viscous and almost lifeless.
"Cuno's not joking."
"My memory loss is being able to predict the outcome of *any* football match."
...and out of this purgatory, it steps in: Without need for any verbal cues, it walks straight into your heart and chest. It's cold and it *takes*.
Your will to power is strong. Your fist connects with his in a *belching* way.
A large metal pendant hangs from the rear view mirror. The pendant features a sun crowned with wavy rays.
What could it be -- like, really? Could it be *pain*?
She looks at him, then at the tree, sighing. "That's a different conversation."
That tag line conjures up a lot of bad things in the mind of the user: doom, gloom, and despair. Such is your feeling about this carousel.
Is the world around you?
A deep sigh, a little nod, the man takes a long, melancholy drag of smoke and says: "Okay. If you want to know, I can tell you what happened."
To your left, the lieutenant considers the situation. He *seems* sure, but you're a slippery animal, so don't be too sure...
Oh yes, sire, you need the *material*. The ghost of *Delys Anka* still haunts this old machine...
"What is the definition of *me*?"
The plush interior is accented with old-world radio equipment, and sounds of distant seaside resorts.
What is this feeling...
That's all she has to say on the subject. She *has* been thorough -- and truthful -- as far as the eye can see.
It's hard to know what you've done, but you *got* to keep moving. And you *will* eventually figure it out...
No one hears you say that, as you put the fork down and go back to staring at the wall.
"They may have guns, but not on this single tripwire." He points toward the post. "The only thing keeping this race war from escalating is *over-excitement* in the corporate-entertainment complex..."
What you *discover*? Probably some kind of *detective* stuff. No one else will talk about it.
"It is." She looks you in the eye. "Why should I just do that? You're right to say that, detective. We're leaving the innossentic system in the dust and forgetting *how* to get to it."
She knows you've been evading responsibility. Let it be that way -- you were the one who came up with the crazy idea.
Please. They must've been voracious, full of sodden papers and uneaten food scraps. It's a miracle they didn't drown in each other's shit like *cats and dogs*.
A lump of flesh is sticking out from under the blanket. It seems to be twitching from time to time, like the paw of an animal who's having an argument.
This man is unravelling. It's a roller coaster of emotions, driven by emotions of pain and longing.
"Mijanou, how come?"
"I know this feeling -- getting shot. Not often, but sometimes. Mostly to deal with *this*."
"I don't think there's anything else I can do for you. Just talk to Andre -- he probably has more than you do."
"I'm still not buying it."
"The Union isn't taking any bribes from the company. This is a true tale of two
Unlikely Surprising Ally
She rubs her chin with her hand, looking at you with wonder and curiosity. "Please don't tell Cuno. We're not doing that."
The lieutenant inspects the boots, assessing their condition.
Your foot has already bled through all the sweat you accumulated since you got there. What else did you do?
He's mostly sorry he didn't catch it sooner.
A tingle rushes down your spine and you feel your hands start to sweat.
At the bottom of the glass, there is no longer a strange sensation of warmth. You're cold now. And that's the coldest.
She gives you a curious look, still smoking. "You mean, like your blind date? I was drunk and everything... But I guess that's not important."
She looks rattled, confused, teetering under all that gear...
The floorboard next to the hole is also streaked with dried sand. It's difficult to make out what's inside.
There's a *spooky* building West of this. Take a flashlight with you, scan the surroundings with it.
The lieutenant looks east -- where it's shadowing -- and waves his suitcase behind her.
The front door has already been locked.
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have missed. This murder investigation has its share of hiccups, but the biggie here is, of course, the *huge*.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here. There's a good guy and a bad guy, you can't be sure about everything. Still, it's better than nothing.
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. It's signed by Idiot Doom Spiral and Garte, just like you suspected.
Something stirs in the insect as you begin to back off. It seems to also takes a step back... Something tells you -- the next time you engage in *direct, *oral* contact with it, it will probably do the same.
Because this is an industrial accident waiting to happen.
This is the last of the experiments. It's in your interest to keep it...
"Fine. If that's what's required, let me ask you something else."
Shanky
The silence is broken by the lieutenant's brief acknowledgement that something is amiss.
Are you ready to die, fatty? Are you ready to die as a COP?!
"I think we should have a look at that window again. There's something there we haven't seen before."
Stop drooling. You'll never get the chance to feel the ocean through the hollow cage at the end of the tunnel.
Your heartbeat quickens, your breathing is irregular... You feel nausea welling up just a moment ago, before it recedes into the darkness of your thoughts.
The sky is overcast, rain pours onto the sand. Already the workers have started to erect some structures on the sand...
It would be *clever* of them to omit this last detail. If they suspect you're lying -- and they already know you're not.
And a little bit of wind too, a faint smell of seashells.
She corrects her wrinkled face: "It's... a little unusual for a private citizen to oversee the *nations* in an international crisis."
The hands of a janitor and a shopkeep attempt to bridge the gap between the fallen boardwalk and the current one. Work is visible even through
A poorly thought out strategy.
"He is wrong. I do not recall any *victims*."
Now you're standing on the wrong side of that, listening to that noise... How very *oppressive*!
"Now we're talking." The lieutenant
He's worried about you. But he shouldn't be. He already knows you're not connected to the case.
This is your least favorite person.
The clatter of typewriter keys fills the main hall of a re-appropriated Krenel factory. Other than the occasional ear-splitting scream, the room is quiet.
"It's not very hard to find." He nods toward the wall. "But do
"A Crumbling Tower of Plaisances"
The card starts glowing, it's a black magnetic tape. A rare *Tequila* washerwoman is depicted upside down on the back, her signature visible on the card.
She doesn't care what you think. What matters is that you're
*shit* was more important than *fun*.
It's the ledger you found in the trash: a dull yellow paper with the tiny pen of the year '48 written under a nondescript municipal logo.
Than god... think of the number of *points* that *could* be taken...
WHAT?
"I'm thinking they've come from out in the open -- in Jamrock Quarter. In the rain..." He stares at the sea and sighs. "The rocks are grey and the sky is grey too. But if you could just find them, we would all be happy."
Sounds like someone's heart just leapt out of their chest. Words are not necessary to fully understand this.
Her eyes sparkle. "Yes, I see you've survived it all, out there on the coast. So why don't you?"
You grab the handle and look into it. A little hole appears, then you slide the cable out and *discard* the lid. Inside lies a small metal barrel with an apparently empty fuel tank.
"I wanted to ask something else..."
Homo came up -- twice. The first time was when Evrart hired him to lead a posse of storm troopers. The second time was when he summoned a posse of *ordinary* law officials to Camp Isidore to discuss the mistreatment of a suspected tax evader.
When you look back at the dirt road, the van rolling down the street, it's hard to see if you succeeded...
As you open your eyes, you are startled awake by the howl of wind, muffled by the strange snore you're making.
What *was* this...? I don't know, but I'm going to say it...
"What you're saying is, we're both on drugs, aren't we?"
He's trying to sound like an asshole.
All you hear is static. A buzzard calls over the radio, its call echoing in the hallways of the West Village Apartments.
PLACED YOUR NOTORIOUS STARBUCKS IN THE FUCKING SUMMIT. *This* is where the <killing* took place. This is your *GRIEVOUS* star. Use it! Use it!
Even though he misses the cut, the cut is not deep enough to drink from. You'd have to do better...
Wait, there's a *button* here? There's a straw? Okay, there's something wrong with your brain. Get outta here.
"Don't worry, Harry, I'll fix it. I've got
Yes, but you would also need to convince Garte to hand over the key to Cuno -- the chief mechanic might be lying to you about the lockdown issue.
You keep nodding solemnly. You must be thinking something profound.
Look, there's a dirty bomb shelter on the roof. It's gotta be on the second floor. You gotta climb up there.
There is no presence of the *wild*, as they say. There is the threat of an entire *reality* show.
A bit of a day off... (Not really.)
Even now, Kim is admiring the skeletal figures, admiring them -- still -- without their guns. They're not pleasant to look at, and his jaw is clenching.
It's getting cold this late in the night. Time to head to sleep.
Doesn't look like it.
Act normally.
Are they? You don't feel right... Don't you feel like there's something wrong with you? Do you feel like you *scared* this man?
"Okay. Okay." He looks the lieutenant up and down. "That's him. He's not the *Ill Death* but..."
"When I need to gain access to an organisation's files, I *escalate*. It's usually a case of *disturbance to security*. I will then question the employee directly, and if necessary, take them to the ICP. If they are not *additive* to our objectives, we will re-intercept them."
Boots that seem to be made of wood, part of a cargo container. The wood is stained yellow, as though baked in the sun.
"No..." He stares into the dangling embers -- then sighs. "I'm not even listening to this."
The day has not made the sheets any less coarse. The bed sags beneath your weight as you close your eyes and fall into uneasy sleep...
"Then what were we, *enemies* then?"
Oh yes... We'll rendezvous in the future, Harry-boy, with Garte, Hjelmdallermann, and Heinrich Heydrich -- all the way to the Col Do Ma Ma Ma Daqua!
"Really?"
A giant bug of pain is sucking the life
"Maybe the quick answer is: no."
"Bag him. Take him away. Do it now!" (Give him to Meijer-Smit."
"Klaasje -- *Klaasje* she is. Her real name was actually... rather unremarkable. Very little is known about her. Her natural history was... interesting. One interesting thing she did -- a rocket scientist named Edward Shendure."
"Yeah, I don't know about that."
"What else is there to do?"
You see the Garte 50 surrounded by four-wheel drive vehicles. All driving around the former fishing village. It's a blur, a blur of noise.
You've got him. Now present your evidence.
To your left, the first in the room, left to his own devices, tries his best to ignore your presence.
There is an entire *litany* of them against you. He might be softening it up. Don't listen to what he thinks, mano or di joolo.
"Well, look at him then..." he looks at you with lust. "If you had a place where you could do this
Before long, the two of you -- detective more -- are looking at something very, very different.
Oh god, *I* need to get *hit*.
"Babies, little ones..." She looks at you with fear and sorrow. "I'm afraid they've left town without even trying..."
"In summary -- not caring about that gun is one of the things I can't do with it."
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a ball on the floor. Three figures on the ceiling scramble up a slab of concrete and a roofing material called *ruins* to get a better vantage point.
You find no sign of life on the doorframe. However, the reeds' howls are still there, rattling the metal.
Haa, so what? You can do most anything you want -- and you never have to feel guilty about it.
A fat chance, says the human wheel.
Sounds like it's gonna be a good test of character, don't you think?
Than god, the lieutenant is here! What a frustrating proposition...
With a loud thud, the door opens. The odourless chemical parade floats in the air and out through its tiny straws.
Seems they wanted to spice it up a bit, make it more *racy*. Doesn't really matter though, as long as it turns out some interesting cop questions.
Someone has left an unidentifiable article of clothing on this railing. It smells really bad.
Only the red cable is plugged into the breaker box, while the black one lies neglected on the floor.
That's what it says on the box. There's no *WINK* in his wink-shaped metal eye...
"By *they* do you mean the Hardie boys?
Who can say? It's a toss-off, really. There's a million little questions you can ask, but you've gotten so immersed in this case that you don't even notice the countless ocean-based radio transmitters...
She laughs. "Now let's not think about that right now, because there's something I should tell you."
"It doesn't matter if it's yours or not. I didn't do anything."
She's a better man now. "Great to hear it. Now, if you'd like something to drink, I'm happy to oblige."
Also! In the previous pages you learned: about the death penalty, and about the customs of Jamrock.
There it is again -- a tiny glimmer of fire, like an ember standing on the edge of the world. Watching you stand there, frozen, the camera focusing on the silhouette of a sad man dancing amidst a sad background.
Hands on him.
"Well, it's definitely something." He straightens his back. "Now, about a... rum and lemonade?"
"So she just smiled. And that's it."
"Uh, let's talk about my important things, like my rank. Let's talk about who I am! What do you want with me?"
He had the force of will, but it was lacking. He'd been on some kind of morphine-addiction kick lately.
Any ideas on what this might entail? Wind is blowing, light from the window is seeping into the crevices. Eventually it will get there.
Something changes in his disposition. It may be related to that strange word, but there is something else hiding in him.
Your fatigue makes the pain worse.
"Fuck you, I don't do radio games anymore."
"Why would you do that? If you were so sure it was an isolated incident?"
You may not be able to dance much, but you can at least *feel* the dancing. Look at how antique that is.
"You weren't the little girl on the ice. You're the little girl in the village. And you are cold."
The *young guns* on the cover sported here -- the kind young men usually depicted here -- held rifles and pistols.
The black keys on her belt disappear into the smoke in the lantern, dimming the lights before you reach the pulleys.
This is an opportunity to start your life anew as a *person*, free of the oppressive suzerainty. But you refuse, choosing instead to *work*.
A row of mugs sits on the coffee table. Each one depicts a human face surrounded by a *blue heart*.
The lieutenant glances at you over his glasses. "We're gonna stop now. You got any more *producers* here? We need them for our pitch deck."
Wait, what? A straight answer? Speed is sort of a drug. Speed is a drug?! Help!
"I'm still going to the island."
She looks at the flowers, then at you, then back at the sky, then at the hills, then at the coast...
"Now is there anything *I* can help *you* with?"
Fuck no, please don't worry. Be cool.
You know it in your lungs where the pressure should form, in your heart that's alone...
It's no wonder the RCM invited you... this is a veritable veritable *wilderness* experience.
Think!
From head to toe -- hisses the motley crew -- the marine biologist is transfixed by your cryptic musings. You have no idea what's *wrong* with you.
What the *fuck* are you talking about? You're talking about a banana peep. It's not your fault the peep was smashed in half. And you'll never get the chance to relive it, my liege.
"Okay, I'm not going anywhere."
You can't help it -- you feel it too. Countless details, little dots on the mural, indistinct figures in the mist...
A barbell lies on the floor of a broken down garbage container. The colour has faded since you placed the trap.
The lieutenant narrows his eyes. "Let's assume you killed him. What about the others? Let's go."
The divide between the organic and the inorganic is absolute. The former is organic, the latter is parasitic.
"Let me get this straight..." he says to you. "Why would you risk your health like that?"
A note of caution before jumping to conclusions: You may be trading life for a political goal. You should still
You're not imagining it.
The lieutenant's right -- the glass is tinted. Don't even try to blend in.
He nods to the man sitting on the swing. "You're soon going to be looking for a *lot* of *hot new things*."
"That's correct. All natural tobaccos. The best-tasting cigarettes on the planet."
Why do you keep saying the same thing? It's like your face is on fire and you need to put out the fire with fire.
As you slowly open your eyes, you see darkness. Before you is a cylindrical steel box, shaped like a bow, with an open top compartment behind it.
Yeah, not a big fan of the gremlins either.
He thinks for a moment, then looks at you with a hint of sad. "...The moment has passed."
She wasn't joking. Your temperament is beginning to tell on her.
A group of redstarts rise from the empty lotus blossom, their scattered hooves echoing through the weather.
There is still some life in there, somewhere. You can't be stupid and say you're done.
What you want to know is -- how can I get her attention?
"Aye." She sits back on the blanket.
"It's not, of course." He stops. "Not on the count of *you* -- it wasn't worth it. But I won't make it, I'll make it for you -- you. But --" He points at you. "-- to make it *easier*."
"Wow, super!"
"Hell no, Kim! I ain't no bug or snuffatoo! I'm a law officer and I *can't* let something like that happen!"
Hey! I've got my disco pants on. Where do you want them?
"Yeah? You think I'm dead?"
Stop. Don't *do* this.
"I don't think she got into that bus anyway."
"I'm sorry." (Nod solemnly.)
You conjure up an impressive array of names, recalling from the dusty records you found in the Whirling's trash container.
"We can't let *anyone* in there."
He ignores the young man. "The chitinous shoe is not *particularly* unusual. Besides, the archipelago is dominated by craters, and there are probably a lot of them. Besides, if the shoe size were... well, *the size*. Size 44 might be more appropriate for you, sir."
"I guess you *are* a pixie, but that doesn't make you some kind of a radical."
(Point to the lieutenant.) "You look like you could use some... hydration."
Nobody taught you to shoot like this, my boy. You'd be better served drawing and doing arithmetic.
You
A young girl watches her mother pass through the curtains. The wind blows in through the broken windows.
The trap falls into the water, filled with a fish-like creature that slowly crawls towards you...
He looks confused. "I don't understand what you're saying, or why you're calling."
"Hush, my partner." (Take the task.)
You'll eventually clear your head. Whatever you do -- go with this first.
Her skin is an oily mess, marbled with polyester. When she's not patching up damage, you'd think she'd at least want a cigarette.
So there you are, a wallflower looking around. You know the type. But what if you forgot?
The boy gives you a long, considering look. "They turned off the lights before too long. You can hear the sound of them fogging up in the air. I guess they thought it'd be *interesting* to document their thoughts in some way."
They've gotta be kidding me. This is a joke. The first time you think of turning this man into an ATM...
Intentionally? Or not? You can't be a detective like this -- detective-work is *not* about joking around.
No, I'm just going to lie here and *forget* that I'm a drug addict.
And just like that, the words leave your mouth. There's an empty socket in your skull now -- no, it's not happening.
No. She doesn't care. The collapse of this wall is her greatest loss.
"Literal..." the lieutenant looks at you, wide-eyed. "Marianne LePlante, 22 years old, originally from the insular suburb of Martinaise... I saw her when she arrived in Jamrock. I think she was on the radio at the time I arrived."
These *if* things don't pan out, you and I will still get up and go to the seaside every day. It'll be like nothing you've ever seen.
A heartbeat now, a glowing red dot on the monitor. Your blood is starting to glow, like a Russian nesting doll...
You've seen the result of countless tests. This is but one of them.
The deal he struck with the locals.
"A little, yes. I can't. Not when it's your turn to do so..." The lieutenant looks around. "If I were in your shoes..."
We are dealing with someone from a far away and from a minor media company. Their accents are not *that* bad. But still -- suspicious.
"I'm going home." [Leave.]
Perhaps it's not the most *polite* of apologies, but it's good someone took the time to craft it.
Write: Aquaman.
"I'm sorry... I've got a lot of things going on here."
What was that about *wanting* something? It's not your *free will* making that call. You can try again -- but only if you have the full *accusation*.
The lieutenant inspects the walls of the test chamber. The cover art depicts a man wrapped in a shroud. The title reads: "Man from Hjelmdall Exposed."
Suddenly you realise you're still holding the bottle.
It's *been* this way for about four days. You have little to no control over the other workers. If anything, you seem to be overdoing it.
"Bitch-fight, C. Bitches are at it. This cop bullshit isn't making us any closer to solving the case."
Are you completely sure you want to ask this guy about the hanging? It could go wrong -- and you might regret it.
An iron safety curtain curves before your eyes, folded like a bellows. It covers half
"Why don't you guys like it more?"
I did not get killed.
That's understandable. Fantasy is supposed to be abstract, but this is more personal. You know. Your failure to give him the queen's crown was her attempt at completism.
"Good thing I got all this gear before I die."
You're sure this wide-ranging physiological variety-busting exercise isn't going to turn anyone into murderous maniacs.
You are super lucid -- yet psychedelic. You can enter his headspace without the help of the mirrors.
She does not appreciate your carelessness. If she knew you were out there for <<10 minutes>> she would punish you.
"Ha ha!" He grabs his head. "Yes, I'm that silly policeman. What else do you know?"
He turns to you. "IMPOTENT SUBJECT OF POP CULTURE, I TAKE PITY ON YOU. YOU CLEARLY WANT TO ENTER THE HARBOUR BAD. LIKE A LITTLE BOY WHO WANTS TO GO ON THE POTTY. I CAN PRESS THE BUTTON FOR YOU -- IT WILL OPEN THE DOOR."
You don't know. It's a miracle you can tell the hair apart as it is. The cuticles on your fingertips are mottled grey like some kind of jungle pathogen.
"Not really, we could still catch a cold, it's just a few metres north-west of here. But it's nearly impossible to get there by car."
Don't wipe it! What use is it then?
All you know is -- this is about the Abbé de Saint-Batiste, whose picture you saw on the can. Could it be connected?
"I'm looking for a businessman." (Conclude.)
You glance over the crowd... there are *many* of you. Far away from here. Dim light from the window gives you a better view of the half-submerged man. He appears to be asleep.
This is the Goose's « Maid of Red Waves », the bird of a distinguished rider.
Stay.
Look up to the sky.
The lieutenant steps in: "We need to talk about the *cocaine cop" -- who -- in this case -- is called over. We have no choice but to address it."
"Very mysterious." He frowns. "Thank you for looking into it."
What you should do is run -- to the church on the coast, maybe? Dark lake, dark records... you would be sick if you were in a state where you don't know this song.  So you won't. But then you won
So the throw was at least tactical?
It's more that you feel uncomfortable *being* near the thing. It's like the ocean is watching you try to detect it. While you are...
The lieutenant is still on the phone, doing his best to not make you angry. Get an exact count.
"Thank you for what you're doing here, officer. Thank you -- for remembering me -- and my people. Even though I've been gone for..."
That ticket stub is a lie too -- there's no way that human can drop more than four *taxes*. Plus you *still* owe the local chapter of the Unauthorized Shops List.
The ice squeaks beneath the prybar. You hear the cold snap of metal as the prybar clicks against the lid.
(Don't speak. Take a breath out.)
They're *not* directly replicating the movements of real people, but they still seem like they would... at least in theory.
Use your hands and feet to reach out into the darkness, like you're on an active volcano.
"What do you mean, cop? Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you pointing at my jacket? There is nothing suspicious about it. I have it open."
"Uh, yes, this is Meade."
But his face isn't even alive enough to be this expression, but as he does, his eyes narrow with sooth.
A very minor victory.
"There's something else, it would seem."
The lieutenant looks at you begrudgingly, then points his gun at Elizabeth. "Hey, can I have the key to the door?"
Oh god, the footprints! The 0-0... case is so damn *old* and *so messy* that it's hard to even begin to begin to explain it away.
PLAY (ENDOFIT?)
"Wouldn't you say it's *ugly*?" The lieutenant opens his notebook. "What do you think, Harry?"
With a violent jerk of the finger the old man yanks the lever back up and puts it back down with a satisfying click.
"This was nice, ma'am. Really nice. Don't worry, it's all part of the huge... we're talking about the history of pale here."
Thanks, Cuno. You're a master of sleuthing.
You need to be precise about this. It's not *only* about information. It's *about* your partner, you throwing him off.
Is it the *End Times*?
The cigarettes are unlabelled and un-lit. There is a puff of smoke behind the woman's back.
Doesn't that lack of interest in technical details show you haven't been paying attention to any art classes lately?
"Sure." The smile widens. "Yes."
As you speak, all the air between the two seats absorbs your exhales and it's instantly at once less dense.
The chair is making a *strong* comeback. You're *much* better at pretending you didn't see it.
"Cuno, I'm gonna take a look around!"
He points to the old shack. "This is where we collected the body and the roof. Don't forget to take the garage door!"
It's most definitely not his name. You won't be able to read it in the evening sky, however, when the winds change.
Well,
That is what *they* will do. They will teach you the dull, painful lesson of human evolution -- about the origin of the species... and civilization.
In this city, life goes on. Young people go on. People in the labour force, as they come, and so do those who've worked their way up through the ranks...
The one called Deanna Deneuve -- she was stationed at the remote Cree airfield Isolation. *Where else* could you see her?
You felt something -- a lump is forming in your throat. The lump is your throat. The Stupor of the throat, if you will.
You stand there, dumbfounded, wondering what the hell is going on. In your drunken haze you hear the lieutenant say something: "...maybe we should scale that wall." And then nothing.
"I'll look into it." (Accept task.)
It does look *extremely* dangerous. You should not go near it. When it comes to, say goodbye.
It doesn't look like there's anything you can do about it. The water reflects back only a vague image of your muscles, while the dark shadow of the call box looms large in the background.
"I wouldn't have guessed you have any."
You peek at the storekeep, waiting for her to be distracted. When she's not looking, you deftly swipe the tie from the waste disposal.
All of this butts up against the Oolite Consulate, the majestic twin towers of the Colosseum. Hidden from view, above -- a black hole of an intellect, who knows what nomenclature it must involve?
No, not the *bare* facts! We need some *stuff*. Stuff!
He's quite worried about the media -- and he shouldn't be. People getting suspicious isn't a good way to go about introducing a
There's nothing -- *nothing* on the other side.
An old door with a missing handle. There's a keyhole.
Didn't they already happen a while back? You're pretty sure you hear the sergeant and the lieutenant talk to one another every now and then.
"Okay, so what's happening here?"
Will you? You mean Ruby?
Yeah, it's pretty fucking evil. Just... should you be?
You hear gasps beneath the howling wind. Outside it's a great howl, but inside it's impossible to discern what's really wrong with you.
Look, the ribbons are getting tangled up... maybe it's a good idea to get you going a little bit faster?
I guess it's also time for a little reality check.
"It can't be, isn't it? The Old
Oh my god...
"I *have* heard about this. The soldiers on Boogie Street come here every night to hunt the *big fish*. You're not the only one, officer. There is always something new and exciting to come here."
Go ahead, ask questions. You fucking *want* to know!
You think you hear a *man's* roar as he shouts at the window to "Get the fuck outta here!"
You still have the makings of a remarkably convincing pitch, even for a child accustomed to mental anguish.
That's brilliant. So much better than talking, in fact. You're an international criminal whose crimes have caused the destruction of worlds.
"Sorry," the dicemaker says with a grimace. "A strange..." She wipes the tears from her eyes.
There's no shame in surrendering now. We all do, it gets *so* dark. The air islets and the mesques and the churches and the meadows...
Why's he withholding information? This is a major point. Now go ask him about the gun first -- he doesn't have to respond.
"It's not my idea -- and neither is you." The lieutenant shrugs.
Now the sharp objects of the screen are in your hand, cutting into flesh and brains. My brain is like a fine art museum...
"How about you stop hyphenating it and start calling me Mister *Mundi* instead? It's a local expression."
How did this happen? Did the poor girl's poor, weak and helpless when she came to and said she was raped?
But... what if I told you there's a *mirror* on your bathroom wall, upstairs? You *could* try getting the *roof* removed...
"You do know that these scenarios are *extremely* unlikely."
He nods. "You guys are ossified. It's painful for her to watch, but she has to keep her cool in the face of total, unrelenting terror -- and trust me, she doesn't. We have nothing to do."
Watching your clothes and listening to your every whim, your every breath, it's turning into an *anomaly*. An *unprecedented* event.
You're confusing them with *lies*. He's saying she's trying to hit you with the question... but why?
People in Martinaise tend to agree, as do a number of prominent art critics and thought leaders with more *nuanced* social awareness than the young ironists.
He is untroubled by the pain.
A dash of wind, a swear, a jeer. The A-Z list in your hand. It's hard to say if it was a good idea to push forward with this insanity.
When did Cunoes
There is absolutely no shame in surrendering now. We all do, it gets *so* dark. It's a process of uttermost importance.
Your tone leaves no room for an argument. You're a total badass.
"Now then."
"Hey, you wanna get to know what you're like? Want to know what your deal is? First you need to *know* who I am."
Yes. So you do -- you indulge in fantasies and schemes concocted by the habit, but is it *impossible* to live without them?
"Fuck you, asshole!"
There was silence in there, too.
Your body has sent a message to your subconscious to leave him alone.
Cocaine? Cocainum? Sounds like the name of a song you heard somewhere -- probably from the night of the fatal duel.
"No," she shakes her head and returns to sewing.
It's not just the stench of liquor running through you, but also your general well-being.
Don't dupe me.
I'm getting a pretty dark vibe from this terminal. If I want to get into the store, I need
Those images remind you of a painful episode of your life. Before you were lost. When you were lost. This horrible place...
The moment is over. The bond between you and this person. The only thing standing between you and... death.
The kid doesn't reply. You should take it easy now, ask something else first, then keep it together.
He nods. "No one could foresee the mutation I've just seen. What happens to the passengers -- and to the crew on the cargo ship..."
There is a pressure on the back of your neck, like a heavy bag on top of a heavy bag.
As you did, the machine swallowed the student's coins and produced a bunch of ICP-branded dice.
"Ehm... does your husband *live* there?"
A heavy door with a missing handle stands before you, covered in dozens (if not hundreds) of tiny images, all of which seem to be taking their cues from your disturbed state.
Rumour has it that the formerly communist nation may have had one of those flags in the air, just outside the gates.
You see two unidentifiable strands of the same blond braid hanging from the rafters. The man himself is crouched behind a large piece of hardware. Two female slaves are seen in the background.
"Oh yeah -- and *anyone* can play with those sweet grandmas."
"So she was wearing a very light upholstered gun that she smuggled into the harbour? From Jamrock?"
The lieutenant looks at the set of wheels spinning again with a mixture of pity and weariness.
A horrifying Storm Front arrives on the scene, overwhelming the senses. A blur of colour blindfolded men disappear into the storm. And the smell of decay and death still lingers, in the air of the cabin.
Oh yes, *bratan*, I'm getting there -- we're inseparable. One minute you're yelling at the other, attacking him with every word you've got.
"Wait. So you *don't* know what these *words* mean?"
Your muscles tense up.
You have a feeling there might be more to it... that there might be *more* than meets the eye.
"I still need to know your *opinion*."
"Yes, that exactly," he says with characteristic efficiency.
In her letter, dated March 4th, Jamrock was mentioned four times. Only once did she actually mention the surfacing of the Iilmaraan desert.
What the fuck are you talking about, man?! You need to talk SHIT about *the music*! TAKE THE MONEY.
He nods. "What we do is deal with the first case we find, and then we move out. If it turns out to be a drug ring, we just move on. If it's a weapon, we just go back to the case."
"Yes, I am a detective. I'm not supposed to be doing anything. I need to connect you to the deceased."
Around her -- an arm's length away -- stand two neon lit shapes: a man and a woman in ragged clothes standing in a doorway. A man in his twenties. A revolver tucked away in a hand-held dark alcove.
Like a machine.
"I'm sure you have an opinion on that, but we need to move on. You'll get shot if you continue."
There is a conga line, underground, in the form of a crater about half a kilometre in diameter.
Am I? A glutton for punishment? A *drunk*?!
"I think I'm having a heart attack."
"If they really had killed him that night -- at that barbecue in the woods -- why didn't they sleep in their cars?"

A similar sentiment was expressed by Evrart, the Nachtherrer's *bardino* (architectural heavy). He did not like the *commies*.
Now get to work, comrade.
"Hmm..." he agrees. "Doesn't sound like a nightmare."
All you hear is your own breathing, through your headphones. The mottled fabric around you begins to clear...
The man swallows his disappointment. Slowly, he turns his attention back to the harbour gates...
A shaggy-looking girl in her late teens or early twenties stands in her school uniform on a window sill. She seems to be in a hurry -- or perhaps she's trying to hurry up? She's not wearing any
"The provincial government doesn't like to talk about its programs, but... in return for the services we provide -- they *need* to know what we're doing here."
"Her parents were very poor, but she and her sister went to the same school -- it was very easy for her to get in."
Maybe you were *too* quick to leave. Maybe the shot was part of a *joint enterprise* -- a job for which you had no qualm. Maybe you were naive?
You need to lower the hum. The >stench* is suffocating. It's choking...
Bystanders reported seeing the king and queen on the throne, as well as Lieutenant Love, his short, red suit.
Shelves filled to the brim with crime novels featuring the supposedly stalwart Vespertine detective, Dick Mullen.
"It's not really a living, it's a *me*. It's like a cadaverous organ, only louder. Rotted like a *rooster*."
Don't go! It's too dangerous being a cop in the boondock stateroom.
The gun battle with the Hardie boys was *officially* over by 10:30 -- the time you started work for the coronation.
The lieutenant doesn't answer, his eyes glued to the animal. It's inside his head, his most vivid image.
Coalition aerostatics hang like apparitions under the cloud cover -- visible, even, through the low-altitude airship's shadow. Hovercraft often leave along with the scent of fossil fuels.
You didn't say it with as much gusto as possible. The *expression* is best.
What if you said you could dial a random number in just a moment? There would be a twenty five kilometre radius immediately. Just a *random* number. No one would hear it...
The desk is *completely* devoid of all functional desk equipment. All cables and wires are hidden behind heavy-duty plastic, and half of the book is missing from the top floor of the case lost and found.
Go. Back away. I have no idea.
No way, you already *were* that guy. Praying was fun, didn't it? Yeah, you're one of the gang, joining Cuno and Finister, those *bangers* and *cocaine* -- who was in there with her?
H.D.B.
A cool wind lingers in the rigging near the mouth of the river Esperance. An old minstrel wears out his cannister and speaks his set from a perch on the lip of a dead whale. The hoarfrost around his glasses melts
It is all over.
I know you're in a hurry, but can you imagine the smell? The deck chair, the body parts...
"Wrecker, huh? Come on, it was a *goon*. Fl
"I don't really know."
No -- he's denying them his blood. Run this by him, after you've calmed him down -- ask if he's okay with it.
Out goes the toilet bowl, followed by the book. Then the toilet paper has completely covered the floor.
"What if I can just run off here while you're all hoot and holler?"
There's a word on the tip of your tongue, a *sobering*. It's like someone has sniffed it, but you can't say what it is...
You're gonna die, remember? And why are you still here?
"No need to frame anything, I'm fine."
Why are you so hell-bent on proving that you're Klaasje's equal? Maybe a *little*? Take it easy, man. You've been getting this type of thing all along.
You put the ledger away.
"Of course, officer," he says with a sigh.
That sounds like the emitter Suzerainty. Then again...
His prick-toot is so dilapidated he could almost pass for a truculent old age. There's a bumper sticker on the passenger seat saying "Drive Hard. Sing Lyrics."
"I'm not sure, I don't have the exact tape for this. I should have at least *thought* about it."
The blinking lights in his eyes. He doesn't see you, but you feel he must be surveying your every move.
You won't be able to dance much, Harry-boy, but you should be able to live with limping around.
You can already hear her sleep. The morning light brings her smile.
The lieutenant flicks off his cigarette and turns to the grey-haired woman. "You two must have fiddled around for a while, because this laptop is totally unresponsive."
This is the *un-predictable* machine that told you the weather's changing. You should have known that!
Could be. If so, then it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to shoot JV. That's not the impression you got from that -- maybe he's lying?
"I wish I had that special sauce for getting people talking..."
You carry the empty bottle around on your shoulder. In your pocket you keep the billfold.
Despite their differences, men like Titus and Filippe believe deeply in the duty owed to their fellow man.
No. That is not your name.
"Now that I think of it, I'm reminded of a few things."
"I'm gonna ask you about this really big thing. A-- and B--."
The moisture is seeping into your lungs. Your chest rising above the rising heart in the blue shirt.
Those words -- "That's some crazy talk" -- feel like something you've said a countless times before.
"But I've been in here a long time. Probably more *than* you let on."
"Well, you're a detective of the RCM."
This is why I don't do it.
"MCHF: What I did was borrow someone's police-issued thermal cup. It's upstairs, in the room with the footprints...
"I'm looking for you -- the *hierarchy of the proletariat*?"
Wait, no! I need to change the topic *now*. Seriously.
And before you go, ask the men -- where are they from? Where did the bullets come from? What are they doing here? Are they dangerous?
Is it? You feel confused. But it is -- it's always confusing. That's why you should...
"Yeah, ever been in a fuckin' pool?"
He doesn't even *think* that way. He's not your girlfriend, no matter how you crane your neck.
He nods. "Like a horse. The beast is laughing at them." He bellows at the gates: "LET US WORK!"
"Yes, you. The Union boss, Dean Muir -- he was talking to you when *you* came up with that phrase."
You're going to need to *detect* this. From the looks of things -- the cryptid is even skulking in the back garden.
That is *the truth* -- and the truth, police detective. Will you allow yourself to be the bearer of that which you cannot be?
He's saying *I* now? These are educated guesses at best.
In a state of being unreachable through his lips alone.
You're a former mover and a successful negotiator. You're not going to do anything interesting for business today.
The jacket copy features a photo of the author, seated on a perch overlooking the all-seeing eye. There's a rose-tinted sun gazing back at him from the throne...
You've seen the symbol before. Its uncanny properties. The connection he feels, upon closer inspection...
"Müssi Saated." He turns to you, his black eyes looking cold. "And I know you're tired, and I know you haven't really done anything, but you can't let your guard down when you're all out."
There's something there -- a lever, a seat, a shoe...
As you look at the rum stain on the counter you wish you'd found a use for the machine. A *maybe* you did...
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum.
The leather-padded desk is adorned with photos of criminals on it, plus a pen and a colorful folder. The thick, heavy-looking folder is filled with tips and tricks for spotting a certain skin-colour in certain individuals.
A lorry stuck in the back yard of a housing development in Remai lead. This was four years ago and the chain is worn down to nothing. It's as if he knows it's a bad idea to mention it any more.
You shudder. The matter in front of you has some sort of magnetic force pulling you toward it. Maybe this feeling
"The fact that he's still breathing -- and in good health -- is very significant. I should investigate further."
When she grows up, and if she grows up to be clever, she'll discover there's a lot of running around and
You pick out a blue plastic roll of polymer sock made from plant fibers. The tag reads: "Crossword puzzle solver extraordinaire."
"*Now* is not the time to discuss matters like *dress code* and *position*," the lieutenant says to you, trying to steady his breathing. "These matters are more important for today. Let's go get it all set up."
Somewhere, in a dimly lit room full of mismatched lighting, two men and one woman stand in a largely empty office. The woman, Linda, is trying to lift a heavy machine that's blocking the way to the roof. She tries, unsuccessfully, to get the floor plan of the office on her knees.
Before you is a wall of ice and ... fire.
Suddenly you feel sadder and sadder, until your eyelids close up and your blood starts to boil...
Because it pleases her.
"Well..." he says with a pensive look on his face.
"Hello, friend." He has no idea who he is or how to explain it. "Are you here for some instructions on how to do something interesting?"
It still took all his strength not to drop the stinking bag right there on the ground.
"I've lost all my memory. It's no biggie."
Go to your inventory and interact with the thing again.
Gone. Gone is the glory. Of song and dance. Of the world, theta waves will wash everything away. Only black sand castles remain. Faint, organic lines cover the broken hips of man and beast.
The fairy sees you eyeing the lighted figures of spooky-making. "An eye for an eye..." she whispers to herself, as you stand there in silent, torch-like defiance.
Your latent racial tension is blurring into the sharp sub-zero gaze of the poles. As you turn to leave, the lieutenant steps in:
Gone. Gone is the coldest of them all. Now your mind slips and the bad thing happens -- your body does the rest.
No sooner has she said those words than the light has gone out of Garte's eye. The image has been replaced with a thick cloud of hissing.
Bulkhead is not the right name. It's the proud owner of the handle, but he keeps it far away from the efforts of the young man to get close.
Stop. You're too hungover to remember these. All you can see are vague outlines of a madwoman sitting on a giant red blanket, pretending to be asleep. Don't look at them.
Just let your muscles relax.
He throws you a look of weary patience. "Please, take the gun from her. We'll be together if she shows it to the police."
Thank god, because then he'd *really* start singing...
Some scruffy-haired young man pulls out a cellphone and begins to furiously call his father's cell number.
She scoffs. "That's so -- why would I walk in the rain?"
A number of things are wrong with you right now. Maybe the most important of them is your complete lack of interest in the young and beautiful young women of the world.
He fixes you with a sharp look, then turns to the manila folder again. "We should go. The sun's so bright outside..."
I'm a little tired too.
"I've heard of Impoverished Homo-Despicable, you may know it."
Later the same day. The lieutenant is out on patrol, doing yard work. As you leave the club you notice several hundred people in the streets, intoxicated and agitated. Wherever you may be, the streets are not there to welcome you.
"It's pretty advanced, by the looks of it." He looks at the blanket, then at you. "Forget you ever mentioning it."
The corona is a beautiful place -- when the corona is clear you can see the shapes of her colours through its haze.
He is highly caffeinated, often known to be the reason for jolt-of-the-moment incidents of intoxication in his drinking companions.
The corpse is going... your fingers are all the way back inside, in his chest... oh, but it's not here. Nothing happens. You hear a *thunk* as the big man looks at the bag and says nothing.
Suddenly there's silence, the sudden gust of wind has eased her worry. She's looking at the harbour walls...
"Excuse me, I don't usually do this."
He's hyperventilating.
Thank you, hail-marshal.
"I really want to talk about it."
No need to be flippant -- that's what the word does -- it has the same *implicit association* as *homo-sexuality*.
"What's your name?"
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some titles: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Mammoth-Riders," "Man from Hjelmdall: Return to Hjelmdall" and the solipsistic "Man From Hjelmdall and the Hjelmdall Man."
You're still in love, Harry.
"I want to buy the album."
His music tastes sour to her.
LOST MY VOICE IDIOTICITY FOR AN TINY PIECE OF SAND?
"You said you're a modern, up-standing citizen, with *traditional* tastes."
Didn't I get what you were trying to say before? You don't wanna sound like a dubiously initiated member of the clergyman's family.
The man sits on a small log with a miserable croak. In front of him is a small display of cigarettes.
He frowns. "Amber Man motionless in a rocking chair. It's clearly an odd choice, even for a cop officer..."
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror as the other, a middle-
They, on second thought, maybe you *are* somehow to blame for the poverty of thought processes!
In the back you see Mariano running some kind of check on Ezra. Does he think he's under arrest? Probably. The dude's too tired to rage right now.
Yes. 2 x 100,000 reál is a lot of change. But a change of this magnitude is unimaginable.
"Yes. We *already* know."
Are you sure it's a good idea to tell him *your* story first? He may be fragile inside, but he's THE PALE.
He shrugs. 'In either case, I have to settle for second place. Besides, there are no prizes for champions -- it's just points.'
The door to the 'Weasel's' Den', guarded by the lionhead guys. The older brother of Cuno the Weasel.
"I bet the hyoid bone is in a different person every time you break the mirror, isn't it?" He turns to you. "Now, it's your turn..."
What did he *do*? He's having a hard time making heads or heads of straight. Makes it more and more likely that it's going to happen, with each passing second.
You're sure. You might as well leave it at that.
It's very likely that none of this has ever happened. There are too many variables to consider. The weight of the universe is with you. You will not pity me.
A man in his late 20s and whose face is streaked with dark brown wrinkles.
Is it cold this time?
Sometimes an encounter with an opposing aesthetic is required for one to truly grow into one's tastes and preferences.
Do you know where this left-right division comes from?
Your clenched teeth are unpleasantly tender. Your fingers are caught in midair, twisting. You've just...
Also, it's made from some kind of armour -- reinforced armour, probably.
"We could have a new witness! Someone might have heard it -- she could have put it on..."
"I'm looking for Gloria. She left in the plague."
"Well, I'd like to say you're a good cop. You're doing a good job. You really aren't making the headlines any more."
"I think we should ask him about the phasmid, any way we can."
"Nice try, but I'm not a freak. I'm a hardie hardie pig." He looks at the bucket.
There is *nothing* here to do now. The Radiocomputer is empty. There's no work for you.
He sounds a *tiny bit* worried, then does his best to ignore the thought, instead focusing on the copy.
Another fragment of the Tranced Infernal Penis is silent in the act of writing itself.
Ask for what?
Your eyes stick on the glowing rectangle in the cold sea air -- until you take the item out of the cold hand: a chilled blue plastic wallet.
Spartans, though, don't like sharing anything important. And trust in you is already pretty low, so...
Edges are semiconductors, tiny optical parts. They're used to transmit electrical impulses, like a camera.
The large man gently lifts his head: "What is it then, detective?"
"From what I've seen, you seem to be a smart guy."
Well, this one, too -- around 50-60 days. You've seen them used to commit more.
The local-- that is, outside the *Valley of the Heads* -- has no business with the city streets darkened by the approaching shadow.
And another body...
A bad memory of what? Or a funeral?
It's almost like something *put* that away -- without even the sneer of it. Like a yearning stone in the hands of fate.
"Thank you, ma'am. I'm sorry."
The flat surface of the coin looks like the sandstone of a sculptured structure. It is, however, still a bit unnerving.
An alleyway behind Grand Couron, back when Revachol was still a metropolis -- remember?
"They're not that different, you see."
The boy is really proud of you, he thinks you're cool -- but he doesn't want to see you in a gangsta hood, because that's *too* hip. *Or* he thinks you're weird because you don't wanna wear his shit. Too.
"It's a call-in show, by the way. Anytime. "
"I would say the Octopus Man is a *particularly* charismatic individual. He was able to persuade people to do things he wanted them to do because he was charismatic and convincing."
It's gonna be interesting to see what they come up with next.
"Does she know your current situation?"
Cocaine? Cocainum? Sounds like our kind of king. We could open the door from that window.
Pick up the radio again.
There's a small, scared smile on her lips, when she thinks of Kim. And then some small tears of laughter when she thinks of them.
The Happen is a candle by the Pox. It has always been like this -- the poison here feeds off the life energy of those who have drank there. Not too different from the others though.
He's drunk. Drunk people don't know morals.
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, is standing with his shoulders slightly hunched. Another, a young woman, tries her best to ignore the third, a middle-aged man with bloated cheeks, who's screaming at her with all his might...
What if I can't stand it?
Perhaps a bit of jealousy? She can't help but notice a certain smug pride in his tone. That he is so *fully* financed...
He points to you. "And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois. I'm afraid he doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice."
The mug's back has *become* prominent. Now take your time peeking.
"This is less than reassuring."
For a moment the lieutenant seems to be suppressing something uncomfortable. Then he clears his throat...
(Squint and move your head toward the exit.)
Look at the blanket, it's pretty romantic.
Now that's what I call *Sorry Cop*.
"Hello, my name is and I'm a cop."
"Okay. Let's find our dead friend." (Go find your dead friend!)
As you look to the horizon, the view again becomes clearer: The supertanker is no more -- the water is actually blue.
A great vacuum forms around you -- a continual *pulsing* sensation, like you've just passed through a great white draft. It's like you've come out of a cold spring.
The bird belongs to the chief executive officer, who keeps it aloft for those keen on observing. It's on its way to the defenceless traveller...
"Okay, Lizzie. I think I know what you're talking about."
Behold the fear and confusion that surround you! On the upside, it's only happening to *one* person at a time.
The man in the portrait looks back at you with a curious look. His name was Ellis Kortenaer.
It's not about who you know, it's about who you don't. This is a game of *names*. How many will you have?
Apparently, the man has an ugly temper and doesn't like people standing in his way. This explains the *Débardeur'' tattooed on his chest. You know, for dressing like a fiddle.
"Uh..." She rubs her forehead with a tired smile.
Her face flushes with excitement, but she instantly recomposes herself. "Oh, I'm sorry, Harry. For such a lovely thing, it's very unprofessional of you to demand *my* name when one's so sorry..."
"Because this is a learning moment for all of us. Look at how *mad* he is! What kind of a *dopehead* did he get?" The lieutenant's tone is cold and relentless.
Your internal history textbook has been replaced with a pile of paperwork, filling out pages like
On the right...
"I don't want to be an old man anymore."
At the end of the day, no one really knows what happened. You could try to theorize a little. But *why*?
There's really no point in keeping the poetry journal. The point is to understand the precise nature of the jet stream and what it means to be in a certain place.
Good, I can see that. Now get my fingers inside the fridge.
"You're just a shadow. A speck in the back of the sea, that's all." He points to the shacks. "But you already got *pointless* in there. Now why don't you go in and make it just a little bit *not* pointless?"
Please observe her expression throughout the remainder of this moment.
"No. I'm done with this pain. I'm done with *anything*. Now let's talk normal shit."
"No-no, sir. We're talking about that *bad* guy now. He's all *bad* now..." He snaps back. "You got
If there's anything you can use as a blip, it's as a crutch: close your eyes, concentrate on the gun instead.
A lean man, he looks straight at you with dark circles under his bushy brows. His jaw is clenched, the floorboard is set against him...
"Did he ever tell you what he did to *your* chitin?"
At first, nothing happens. The document you are about to rip up is as blank as the document before it. All that remains is to collect the signatures of the stakeholders -- producers -- and mail it to Frittte.
"Very funny. You're a typical *commie*, but I like the colour red."
Your shoulders give a series of jerky shrugs.
The man before you stands in a ring of reeds, wearing stained aprons and holding a small toy gun. His back is hunched.
"I remember, I remember..." The lieutenant looks at you with sudden admiration. "I remember all the time..."
"Okay. You're with the RC
"Mack is dead. Dickshit Richie is off his fucking throne." He raises his collar. "Time to party."
"Egg Head, huh?"
"It's not just the Staszkos, and it's not just the Croco -- it's the entirety of Revachol. The Sec
It hurts, but you're strong. You could stand up here for a moment and try to push the panic button again.
You're calling the shots here, but you refuse to acknowledge it. The story doesn't interest you. Maybe someday you'll quit talking about it.
"But then again -- so have I. It's not my fault they went the other way." He looks at you with amazement.
"I don't know, but I'll find you one."
"My name's Garte. Over."
Choose a path.
Don't Be Evil
"Then you *didn't* disappear."
A vision of pain and destruction, the *final frontier*. An open-air market town on the edge of town.
From a far away rooftop window overlooking the whole district: A piece of the pavement, laid out in a park, left unroofed for four months. Two cars per half-hour. Part of the pavement has been painted over.
"We don't have time for this. Let's go get the alarm, alright? I'll call the library when I get the chance."
And ground-based assets *now* -- he *now* wants to take them. And then he'll get out of this.
"Okay, I guess that's it. I can stop being a part of this right now."
He considers this for a moment. "I have no idea. I don't know what you mean either. Just... ask away, start talking, I'll wait. Don't be scared."
Yes. That's a gross exaggeration. But it's what they gave you, so...
Right, what do you want?
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what's really wrong with you? The interviews, the poking and prodding that you'll undergo?
With a puff of smoke, the lieutenant puts the deadly cargo waste-to-heat onto the small burning platform. He shifts the heavy cargo belt, and with a loud thud the chain moves through the air.
"So tell me -- who is *Korty*?"
I know you don't. But the thought still comes -- he must have had doubts about everything once...
"Let's talk about our right to work..."
Your voice carries on the wind, it carries with it the faintest of sounds: a dim outline of a certain cuisine, reminiscent of an industrial kitchen used to produce dishes out of metal and wood.
So basically what the corporatists are saying is: you've gone through enough already. Now it's your turn.
Are you going to park it in the lot? In the back? In the cold? Leave it there like this? You have to at least do your *best* to stop you.
Maybe if you cracked the damn thing, you would have a cap. And *still* be standing. But you didn't. So -- guess again. You're out of luck.
"Um, have you been to the cemetary lately? About the meadows there."
A sudden gale blows in from the ocean outside. The temperature drops to -20°C. The schooner La Cherte d'Orleans is too large for the docks to handle on her container. She is placed in a cold box.
"Told you we wouldn't see each other." The man quickly changes the subject. "Any questions?"
"Didn't I just say it was my favourite thing in the world?"
He's not feeling very comfy in his own skin.
He is your enemy. Do something right now!
Read the second entry.
"*We're gonna* do it -- do it together." (Go for it.)
His eyes are milky blue and his broad forehead can only bear a single conspiracy -- though he suspects *everyone* is conspiring against him.
You see the same small pen on the white board, still scribbled on a thick layer of brown paper.
Well, *that* doesn't sound like Lillienne's real name.
A sliding scale of -1 to 1001 (the highest category), with the highest number being 1001 (Titus's Lamentation). There's also a snowflake on top of it, weighing a single grain of salt.
You're trying to pick the heart off a stick, really, hunched over there -- very gently -- using the Semenine Hermit Scale.
Correct! Dolores Dei was a mortal woman -- a *belle* -- and half-sola, an alter of mad scientific experiment. She instigated a war between her husband's troops. The war was lost long ago.
Bent metal and all that. Look at all that shit under the table!
He really does not want to say anything.
He's not sure you're ready for this, but don't let him force you. You'll slip and do it anyway.
Later you'll find out why Gangrel preferred hanging out in hell to any of the other holes in the Quester's *spectrum*.
You shouldn't. Besides, you're not *even* sure you're black. There's a *possibly* there, but you can't make that out on the spot.
He's lying. He wouldn't do that. It would be unprofessional.
He looks at the frozen tug-of-warring. "If you had to guess, you'd say it's a matter of days before the workers begin."
"Tell me a secret, Egg Head..."
You're falling apart at the seams, crack the case and try again, try *TOGETHER*!
What are you talking about? She didn't want you to *think* you stole the show.
A massive energy bubble rises up in the air of your brain. It's a glowing basketball hoop, a flickering light in the dark.
The big guy smiles. "Maybe so, sir. This isn't the Cuno I knew. Cuno killed himself. Understand?"
He throws you a look of weary patience. "Well, it's your birthday today -- it's your *birthday*! And it's your last chance to start listening to the wind, by going to the pawnshop."
"Some people in the Jamrock Quarter are treating this like some kind of cult death cult. But they're mistaken. This isn't some dark mystical crash, it's my
"It's done," the lieutenant declares.
"And you're in charge." She bows and salutes you. "I am queen of the world. You may rest easy tonight."
And if it is not, who is?
I've seen enough. Leave.
"Oh yeah -- I can't. It's too *mysterious* even for you."
"A significant portion of the Freire the Näth -- the Hsin-Yao Commune -- have already gone native and *left* themselves. The remaining 80% have barricaded themselves behind their rail lines, ready to be crushed by an invasion of gu
Maybe, but Kim might have to run some kind of race around the coast to catch up to you. Or maybe not...
There is nothing. Only the blue light of the scissors' blade. The wind is cold.
I need to call my station. They would have processed this without you. Now you'll have to come back to them.
Inspect the bullet again.
There's no other option.
Okay, the man with the sunglasses and his *hypothetical station 41*. Isn't it the most *prestigious* piece of real estate in Revachol West?
"Told you it wasn't my idea!"
You and the lieutenant circle the fort in the north. Beyond the half-built *communism tower* there is nothing more to do.
"Okay. I guess so. Who is the lead programmer here?"
The machine swallows your coin and whisks you away, along with the plastic wrap. Happy with the courier's goods, you hitch a ride on a moving parcel.
You can barely hear yourself think. Your hand, though, is itching to start swinging again.
Whistle a tune.
How many more promises can there be...
I could take the shot.
They've got you -- they've got you *locked*. In a courthouse, in downtown Martinaise. All those mugs, like you've never held before. Some have even gotten *shanked* -- these are the last of the files in the world.
"That's *not* a problem. Do what you have to do. Nothing personal."
I have no idea. I'm too dumb to know. Maybe you should just say it? Or take it easy? Be weird?
An angry twitch runs through his face.
Behind the plywood -- where the brass fittings attach to the frame -- you see a piece of polymer.
The words *bad ass* sound like motherfucker words that rhyme.
She thinks for a moment, then nods. "It's her -- it's all hers..."
Of course! You're probably seeing a pawnshop owner called Ellis first -- the man's *initiative* recognized the name of the pirate.
In the middle of a broken plaza, in the heart of La Delta, in the midst of a housing development called The Happen, in the shadow of Saint-Martin there looms a phasmid -- bigger than a horse -- looming over all.
You can't leave that woman there, Harry-boy. You need to get *immediate* medical attention.
You were just getting warmed up. Warm up by the Kvalsund diet. Get your classic *copo-ty* and quell that burning fire that's lithe and plump -- baby! Now brush that oily ash off your hands and smile at the sky.
"The shooter used a rifle, not a rifle ammo -- a private military type called Kiejl A9 or something like that."
"I agree."
The young woman laughs out loud, turning her face with a look of unimaginable tenderness. The tape recorder lies propped against her ear.
No reaction from the old man. His entire being is focused on the waves washing the sand, but you can feel him tense up...
It's a rainbow, nothing but a speck of colour, caught between the two paisley patterns.
You flush. A little.
What are you talking about? Are you sure you wouldn't rather be thinking of yourself?
"Okay, detective."
The movement of the leaves is not noticed for a moment. "There's nothing like the scent of rotten food to stir the tastebuds of a hungry crew..."
The number '4' is conspicuously absent from her ~expression*. Perhaps you had difficulty finding it?
Their numbers are disorganized. The boys' empty nancies are accompanied by at least two more women, all hunched behind the three fiddle boys.
You should sing this, for dear...
Just get out of here. [Leave.]
The lieutenant's still not buying your story.
The captain watches you jerk a stinking stinking tear from your duct. You're still recovering, brother.
"Right here. I know."
"A worthless piece of trash. Why is she in the
As you glance over the water -- at the sparsely populated beaches of the Lagos Peninsula -- you notice an op-ed by a prominent citizen journalist, Anna Deneuve, in The Age.
There was a period of turmoil after the War, as millions of us tried to claw ourselves out of poverty. It was called the Katla Financial Kurzweil Inden-On-Scoer. It lasted from '05 to '06. The median year was '06. If you want to get more specific you could say 'Katla' is *anywhere*, but mostly Indochina.
"An easy 45. I can see that." He looks at the red book in your hands.
He's right. No idea. You might just end up back here.
Yeah, let's keep it that way -- he's not happy.
"Cool. Nothing. We have a long way to go, detective. But the first reports of the lynching are usually
"What if I want to know more about the phasmid..." (Point at the phasmid.)
YOUR MOUTH IS LIKE A STREET THE WORLD OVER
You sound like you've pulled of a wondrous prank on the woman!
Your mind drifts to the right. There's a gun -- a fake one at least -- just like the one you found in the RV.
You should still wait until the lieutenant gets here. He'll be inspecting the tape.
He's not feeling his best, does he...
Okay, well...
"Not a lot. I get mad easily. And don't like dealing with *cursed things*."
You see an old cylindrical generator. Older than most in this part of the city, but still in tact.
A cold gust of air dries your sweaty face and you look to the darkness ahead, when suddenly it's clear you shouldn't look...
He nods. "I had my doubts, but now I know for a fact that she's not missing. That's *exactly* what she should have done. Even if it was just a *fishing expedition
The picture seems to have been left on the door's wooden panel anyway... you can't really see it clearly without the flashlight.
There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe you should ask the Begnion
He waves his hand, with his eyes bulging. "I'm not gonna discuss biographies. We're not allowed to tell people about their lives."
Boots would make *nothing* but muffled chit-chat even *more* interesting. There's a greasy old shoe lying around in Martinaise.
Pyrholidon -- a *highly* toxic dark oil. Used in ferroelectric aircraft, often mixed with formaldehyde to make it smell even worse. But there's nothing *like* a cop's scent.
He nods, taking out his notebook. "What are you going to do, detective? You're injured, remember?"
The legend of the *ghost carabineer* has spread far and wide, and now you and Cuno are left standing in the apricot-coloured light of the TV.
Not only his name, but his address... You are thrown off by this *paranoia*. People don't trust 'cop cops' any more.
This *Heartiste* has more than just his work in him. A look of rage in his eyes, a roughness in his voice. For a moment it almost seems as if he has cracked under the pressure. Then he straightens his back. "Okay, let's go."
"No need for this silly thing. Let's not even get into the other suspect -- the one that *shot herself in the head*."
Of course. And then it's gone. Almost all of it -- except *the little circuit board* that stayed on the board and got trampled.
So much pain.
He looks at the sign and sighs. "Perhaps if you were to, instead, photograph the people who live across the road? Maybe they'd reveal more about the Union's darkest secrets..."
The Big Bad wolf of Kraad, or 'Wild Pines' as he called himself. A composite of various *pales* -- his sub-genres included.
You only have one, maybe two things left to say before the shift ends. Guess you just have to work it like you did -- work 'em.
The large-headed youth gives you a quizzical look. He *does* seem to be misquoting you, though.
The bright future of the Working Man is secure.
Really now? Two bad things -- smoking and drinking? You just can't tempt fate like that. Better to call it a day.
Where to even begin? There's the damned scent of cigarettes right next to it, some of them *old school*. What *is* this?
"Kim, Kim, I'm sorry I don't know any more. This was the worst situation I've ever been in."
"We won't. It's not our business." The lieutenant looks at you skeptically.
What it comes down to, really: *Nothing*. The presence of a bullet hole *literally* negates any kind of argument.
Damn. Turns out a little elbow grease goes a long way.
"Oh no, Harry. It's not the scissors!" He arches an eyebrow at you. "The real story here is -- how did this *ch
"A miracle, that's a miracle!" He feels the pain recede. "Never in my wild, wild... wildest dreams did I think we'd be witnessing an operation here... I am truly, truly thankful. It's a miracle we're not dealing with a
"How is that still happening to you, detective?"
You really ought to talk to Kim about this. He knows more about law than most.
"What *do* I think? Should I blame it on this crack whore?"
"Exactly. We're talking about the same thing. I'm not a goddamn psychopharm, man. I don't care about your *ideas*."
"THE RACIAL NATURE OF THIS PLANET IS TO LEAVE THE PLANET BEING YOU." He pauses to glance over his shoulder.
He's thinking he's an idiot for not recognizing the two guns at the bottom of the screen. Guess again -- he's not buying it.
What am I thinking, man?
And here we are again, 1986 -- people walking around and *taking* the stairs up? What a strange time to go on stage, and so often on stage in this strange world.
The timestamp is off. It says: 11:47 -- but who are we kidding, right? You've *got* to come up with at least one more thing.
"You're right, this must have been *you* talking about the red chair."
Keep your eyes on the books. There's something about those red lipstick, maybe?
The romantic in you feels your last thought has been as you've said it. Well, *maybe* it wasn't your cock. But then again, it doesn't have to be a big one. Just a small thing.
"You're drunk. We all are around these days. We're in shambles here. But we never give up. We never give up on life!"
He knits his brow, thinking. "She's clearly not an antiques enthusiast. Or a collector. Or both. It's very unlikely that she's part of the flea market she's hidden in for her large head. Plus, she wouldn't be in the city
"Yes, I am." The lieutenant wipes his brow. "I'm glad we're finally having a good conversation. Now, let's get back to work, shall we?"
Your posture... it's grim.
"What's the deal with the killer?"
Whatever you do, don't say you've ever heard the intrepid Lewis borrows from Cuno. He wouldn't believe it.
"Tell me what *you* want to know." (Conclude.)
Why would he want to hurt you?
The documents still sagging from the clipboard in your hand -- these too are quite old, sire.
"Wasn't there a door here that would let me in?"
Oh my god, the footprints! The bullet holes in His footsteps! All over the stage! The audience! The clubs! Where *did* the concert go?!
Yes. Ruby the *lady driver* is the source of all evils. The mother of humanism calls and complains about the racket, but she never gets the chance to do
"That's right. I don't think I have the left-right compass in me anymore. But I'm going to try."
All the lies have failed.
Something very special happened. (Bonus points if you can trace the history of *The Expression* back to this.)
The sky is indifferent to your rudeness, but the lieutenant seems to appreciate your honesty.
Look, look, it got worse here. You could still get it off, but you're not sure you want to. Maybe you should just not go for that.
It's cold. Windy. The place is especially so because of the two boxes on the roof just south of the main entrance.
This must be the titular role of his *senpai* -- a reference to the Dean and his friendship. But I'm not *charismatic*...
"First they come from the schools -- then from the colleges. Then it's your turn..." he tries to reassure the frightened little ones.
But I *do* *not* want to question him on the spot! Let's get back to the story.
Almost there. Hold on! There's still more to do...
He stops to consider your words. "Maybe it's okay if I don't do it. But I might be able to do it better if you put your hand on my heart."
She's more upset than she lets on.
"Oh, yeah." The old man sighs and falls silent for a moment.
What did he just call you? Someone needs to check on Egg Head. You're going to have this discussion more formally, perhaps?
Your pillow is like a miniature king.
"I am. How do you think I got here?"
You've done this before. Pleasure is bliss.
Your socks are *all* done *covers*. The ghost of previous socks drifts in the background, untroubled by your gaze.
"Or..." He tilts his head, suddenly worried. "You could just give me the key. I don't need it anyway."
He's not okay with it. Don't listen to him. They're scared. And you're a dumbass who doesn't care -- pick up the card, see what happens.
The colours are oleaginous. Oligopolites? Can't you smell that sweet sweetiord?
"I knew it! I knew you weren't one."
"...Because you wouldn't have gotten to him anyway."
He chuckles. "We're still in the early stages of the investigation, so there's no telling *when* it will end. But, if you're serious about catching 'The Man with the Hole in His Head', you need to finish this case now. Otherwise, there will be consequences down
I don't feel anything.
Water's mouth moves and faucets appear/disappear. Faucets appear again, as dark brown liquid pools around a faucet. It's becoming apparent that the bay is more than just a two block radius anymore -- it's an ocean full of water.
Well, you know one thing for sure -- the lieutenant's *not* his real name.
The man before you is tall and lanky, with shoulder-length hair and a scrappy accent. He's clearly a police officer. You don't even have to like him to get the case -- but he will.
Say something.
"Alright, officer. This one's going to be much harder on you. You have so much baggage that it's nearly impossible to track down even a single thread that explains your case. But I'm sure you can come up with a few reasonable guesses."
He means it. It is unspoken, hidden, perhaps even sacrificed in silence -- that which you cannot *remember* having. But then...
The signal in the noise?
"Look, it's just black specks, tiny dots on the waterline. Nothing to see here. Just a waste of
He gives you a sad, angry look, then turns to the man before him. "You got him, Harry. I can't get you out now."
Another wave of pain shoots up your right side. Pain higher than even you could bear. You're hungover again and can't remember the last time.
"We're good. There's no need to escalate things."
I've said *some* crazy things, drugged cop bullshit... But I've been innocent all these people have to be at least a little bit scared.
"You know, I *do* know the difference between normal and artistic. Let's get real... he's down. With worms."
He's right. That trash container is the best example of consumer product iron that you have not yet seen.
How does it get you so angry? Did you come here to *kill yourself*?
There's a pause. "Maybe it's a good idea..." She looks around. Then she adds, in a hushed voice: "It's her. She's one of the founders of the RCM. If it isn't her then who knows where she's coming from."
Oh, no no, *bratan*. I'm talking about your broken gun. Forget it. You can't even remember the fucking thing!
Come on, *bratan*! You've gotta lay off that booze for now -- tell her about the dead man's shoes.
"I'm sorry, I couldn't resist." (Lie.)
"That's still not an answer, ma'am."
The woman's gaze follows the waves as they wash away the surface of the beach.
She [Auntie LePlante] sounds smart, even after she's said some stupid things. This woman is smarter than she looks.
Across the room, upstairs, in Klaasje's bedroom -- the remote viewer is on. Talked to her, if you can...
What the *fuck* are you talking about? You're probably fine. Go on, finish the damn thought...
He was always meant to be a really bad ass cop, like Cuno. But hes *always* meant to be Cuno.
Klaasje may have been tipped off by you. Or you just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
He takes a sip from his flask. "Maybe it's my body working overtime? This all a sign that I'm insufficiently hydrated. In other words, *not* thinking about it. Until you guys get back to work, let's just say I *guessed* it was some chemical taste."
"I didn't know it was *me*..."
Oh, yeah. *Ignore*. He doesn't know *anything* about dancing.
Hair sticks to the body's lower lip.
Your hand is covered in muck. The battlefield will not tolerate *excessive* loss of officers.
Below the heart-felt sentimentalism, the result is a large block of wood: a boardwalk with many tables and chairs facing one another. The smell of damp hair and heavy materials.
I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but I can't predict with *STD*, liver damage, or any other sort of Inuit bodily fluid.
A hundred years have passed since the end of the world. Relativity has frozen the world into place. You are, of course, as well.
"It's a sentence, Kim. An actual *crime*."
"There's no such thing as a truthful appraisal, officer," he replies sharply. "We're good enough for you to work
Something... strange. You always thought there was a *reason* behind it. But now you realize it was an addiction, a *disease*...
"I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. If you're talking about the police then I *might* have a little idea about what happened."
If nothing, then who is?
"I mean, I don't know. Maybe it would help me become more of a *convoy*..."
You pull the trigger, but it only angers the feeling man. He angers his finger at the paper again.
"Huh? What is a 'pulsar'?"
"Maybe she's hiding something."
I'm not sure my son agrees with you, but he should... because that's the kind of brother he is.
I don't want to feel anything... [drink in silence, it's fine]
"I guess it's a *crab* then."
This is not *all* about you. There is also *another* girl, just as gorgeous a shade of brown as Ruby, who is very, very important to this shade. Ask if she's there if you can't remember?
Oranje? Oranjese map of waterways? This fits the area code even better than the *hole* in the ground.
I was stupid. I didn't realize how bad it was going to get. What were you thinking? You need to get back to this.
It's there, but it's not really there. It's just something else. Somewhere far away your mind draws
Of course, not everyone is on board. Perhaps you shouldn't push it as hard as you are? Anyway, the medicine cabinet is a mess.
There is of course the very real possibility he was both shot in cold blood by a sniper from the outside and that he himself was framed for his death...
"I don't know... I'm not a huge fan of the officer. He seems to be a little *strict* about things, you know."
The copy machine doesn't respond. What's happening? The grip on the handle is tight...
"The proprietor of this establishment has been here before."
"What's the weightlifting world record? I want to know."
You were very cool.
Just like that the rain begins. The cold air quickly moves the bones and clothes from your body. And then, finally. The glacial touch of the Marjorie off the coast of Hjelmdall.
The sea is not over yet. My lord's men are still here, somewhere...
The freezer hangs like a science experiment container, ice cream flying everywhere as you leave it with a satisfying *thunk*.
"And that's just it. Now, how about we do some speed and question these guys a bit? Right now, huh?"
"I'm gonna fuck your brains out."
"Forget I asked, did you miss my handwriting on the note?"
"I don't have a..." he stumbles. "AIIIIIGH!!!"
Soon the whole world is a veritable graveyard of skeletal connectomes: Motive's message, a warning of the horrors of the world.
You're not sure if the woman in the video is telling the truth or not, but she does it for the camera. It's the perfect way to open his eyes.
The writer was stuck on the *event* and couldn't come up with a story for a week. A week without break!
Goddamnit, don't be silly, it's not like that.
"Yeah, it's nothing. I know it. I'm sorry." He looks at the pile of soggy logs at his feet.
All you hear is hers...
"Didn't feel like anything... Like a pulsating heart. Like you were *hungry* for some kind of explanation."
This girl seems to be in some kind of *loop*. Like she watches you - *not* merely from the perimeter but also *on orbit*.
Over the years, as the network of radiocomputers has spread across Martinaise, the Cryptofascist has accumulated great credit and is generally accepted as the most influential person in the world.
"I might, but I'd need to look into it first."
A wall of sound has sprung up in the air, filling up all the empty spaces. It looks like a choir tuned to a certain frequency.
So you don't *have* to? So what? The wearied bureaucrat is the sort of fellow who has to be accompanied by at least two others at all times.
The sky is not that way. It's cloudy and heavy with industrial pollution. You feel the air moving jacket -- get closer...
As he shifts uncomfortably, a series of clicks, like the clinking of glass beads against one another as they roll across a hardwood floor. Your hand moves, a membrane covering your fingertips.
Keep your eyes on the drugs, monitor your surroundings. You *can* see someone *doing* something suspicious -- even if they're not *you*.
Steady hand gestures. Straight into your palms. Even with the -20 C unplugged, you're palms still greasy from the grease...
Yeah, because you gotta keep moving. You can't sit or stand still while these animals get wild and silly.
He doesn't seem to understand the reasoning.
You may have other, *legitimate* reasons for wanting to rid the world of the Filippian phasmid -- he seems like a nuisance.
A *little* haste -- perhaps you could complete the *journey* by now.
"A gander," he repeats. "You wanna know where I take this?"
No. I don't want to say that. I don't want to do that.
One night you're sleeping... Not on the couch, but in a abandoned room off of a four story building. There's a large rodent slumbering around the abandoned attic. Its limbs are long gone, not found...
"Oh, but... I'm not a gardener, by the way. I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union. I can't help you with paperwork like this."
In a small office behind the Old Military Hospital, hunched under the green glow of his desk light, officer John "Glen" Mullen flicks through a pile of paperwork before settling on a few lines.
And do it. Last fucking swing.
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone while the other watches him do it.
The surface is disrupted, turning a blind eye, looking in two directions. In the first, the lights of Martinaise cast a long shadow. On the roof of the shack.
SHIT.
There's a spark of nostalgia in the young man's eyes as he looks at his mother's breast and sighs.
You can see it: her shoulders, her broad hips, her stomach... Her whole being is in visible disarray.
Just like that, the cadaver is down. The sound of it hitting the pavement disappears, replaced by the regal static of the motorway.
You feel *put* down. The indignity is all you hear. Your heart beats like a hell of fire.
Like a stick insect, the tyre tracks go up the length of the patch. The length is 64* and a width of *two*.
This isn't talk -- just *the coposite*. Talk is talk. Stop wasting time trying to *be* cool. Be cool.
Also, Cuno hasn't stopped talking to you. Even reads your notes. He seems to be genuinely impressed.
Where *are* these two? You have no idea what they are. You feel dizzy and nauseasaline.
You're a lucky son of a gun! You've got this, a cool gun that a cool person could own...
"It's not. The snivelling shit-licking policeman isn't part of our group. I'm part of ours."
You think it would be *great*? The world's end is drawing near. The jolly empathetic fin de rêter said so himself.
You can feel your heartbeat rise and leave your lips like a spring.
"No, I mean the *Revolutionary*."
"I don't know. I didn't mean to sound paranoid, but... do you know what actually happened here?"
That's it. Kiss the door. After you've done the *thing* -- the autopsy form -- come back and ask about the ice cream maker.
"Aye, so here we are." She stares at the wave pattern in the water -- then at the darkened tower. The sky above is grey and the sun sets slowly.
Oh, you must be *dead* then.
Suddenly, the hold pattern for the satellite phone starts moving. It's PODCAST EDITION -- A TWO SEASON RUNNING COMIN COMING.
Sometimes, when laying out a narrative, it's helpful to take your foot off the gas again.
"You're *not*!" He stares in you direction. "Shameful scab!"
"It's not *that* far fetched, officer. You're the Lieutenant-Constable of Precinct 57."
There's a snowglobe on the sea iceberg. Its depths are unknown. You can *feel* it.
Reality... (Listen more closely.)
The expression... it says so in your eye.
It's more complicated than that. He has a hand-held device -- a video camera. A piece of paper -- in an iron-bound notebook -- is attached to the board, above the notebook. The name on the note is *Oranjese Policeman*.
The girl keeps her shoulder pressed back. There is no one nearby for help.
As the suzerain travels across the Insulindian isola it encounters numerous roadblocks and embargoes. Most of them are ignored, if only because they don't *define* territory.
The body goes limp suddenly. Oddly enough, the dead man doesn't *die* from hypnagogic exposure. He's up there, as always, a plume of smoke and mirrors threatening to swallow you up.
"Yeah, that's right. And *why* didn't you just tell me that?! Why aren't you thanking me for doing your job, huh? Go talk to him again, man, you're a legendary cop -- who needs big words?!"
"I don't want to be that guy any more."
Drowned in a sea of colours.
You're not wearing a hat -- you're wearing *fossilized* armour. Made to withstand the elements.
He nods. "It makes sense. The species has adapted well to their environment. Rock music is a natural by-product of this planet. You'd find it even more interesting were you to hear what's really going on down there..."
Wanna-boiad? You think there's something worth telling him about the fridge -- just so you can have a *smoking* gun, okay?
What was with that *sir*? You need to ask her about the black box! You need to get *inside* here.
What you *wanna* do? Go for a round of drinks on that stage! Get some *stoic dancing*.
She waves her hand, very earnestly, as if trying to say: "Please, just take it slow, okay?"
"Ominous, aren't they..." He raises his nose to his temple and a slight shiver passes him, as he looks to the sky.
The man watches you jerk off, his eyes welling up with something akin to pity.
She was overjoyed to get the news, but at the same time, worried that the corporal would take her away from you. Don't listen to *Gaston*.
The wind picks up. The silence
It would be *clever* of her to omit these details, however. This might go against her façade as a moderate.
No. You're spinning some sort of crazy. It's not a *true* story. Don't say it. Do detective work.
The print runs are broken into smaller footprints. Some are circular, some are satellite-shaped. These *discovered* under more moist conditions.
"I see. I am fairly certain I am an ill omen. You should seek medical attention as soon as possible."
"Funny, I thought your quantum entroponetic training was in order. You still owe me 100 reàl. If you don't have it by tonight, I can't let you up there..." he points upstairs, toward your room.
What happened?
What about yourself, in general?
What *were* they trying to discover?
She looks you in the eye impassively, keeping you from "drowning" in your drink. Then she makes up her mind about the best way to go about it...
You're not calling this: (Pause quietly, looking around) "Officer!"
A couple hundred thousand people -- the government in the sticks. An almost intractable situation.
Close your eyes and try to see inside your seagull.
Before you is a polyhedron, suspended in mid-air by a string made of reed and birch branches.
He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "Even Cuno knew it was a military vehicle, right? Like a gazelle or something."
The lieutenant throws you one of his *looks*. "*One* cryptid -- it most likely is part of the same species as the recently extinct genus, Hexapoda."
You could ask her about your conversation earlier -- to make sure you recorded correctly. It's something she'll appreciate.
"Who am I kidding? You don't even have your *bad ass* anywhere near here! Who do you think would *protect* this place? The Hardie boys... I know you do, pig. I'm the Hardie bitch!"
The man places his battered *body* down on the concrete square of a carton. A tragic music box in the shape of a woman's figure...
"Great, thanks officer." (Grab your badge and keep it.)
"Just let me know if you've
Suddenly, from behind the warehouse, emanate a profound feeling -- a feeling of warmth, like a pair of boots on your back.
A standard primer, probably. The room is too small for a primer of this calibre.
A total of four suspects have been narrowed down to a single suspect. While one of them, a *lame* doth doubtlessly plotted against Evrart's economy, the investigation deep into this case might prove challenging.
You see a list with all the names of each player on it. The amount of wömen is exactly *eight*.
"I see... But I already know that. So, what else? Anything else to do here, officer?"
You have no idea what *second chance* is, Harry-boy. Go with that -- second chances aren't important.
Slowly, you move your hand toward the paper clip. Before the rope runs out of your hand, you catch it...
He nods. "The colours never fully faded from the faces. Even the BIS had a callous streak, though it seldom
The lieutenant stops to take a note. His glasses wave in the cold wind.
Well, if you don't want to *sleep* you could always go crazy on ecstasy... Or worse, wake up half-naked in bed, covered in snow and ice...
"Some crap? No shit, I'm not a hobo. Fuck that shit and stay here."
Backing away from this wall is like letting go of a past relationship. Things got awkward.
That makes more sense than the other stuff I thought of.
"No need to apologize for getting you to change your name." He blinks again, suddenly very tired.
I know you don't want to, sweetie. But what if I *stole* this idea? What if I just presented it as a joke?
"I am," he whispers. "But not quite."
Yes. The physical resurrection of *Fred* will take place on *Pyrholidon*, the god of syrupy rum and lemonade. Bring it on.
For a moment the giant depends on your strategic presence. Then he looks at you. "Yes. I had other questions, sir."
(Turn to Kim.) "I don't wanna do this any more."
With your fingers tired from the second floor -- from the feverish dance floors, the fires of the past -- you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the
See, there you go, *reluctantly* -- *confusingly* -- over breakfast... This doesn't sound like
In the grocery store a man in an orange bomber jacket is stuffing a bag with food and water. At the
The lower extremities of your body are covered in cold sweat. If you stand up straight you could probably even twirl the hell out of it. But that's not how you like it. You just stand there like a rag doll.
Lilienne. You could of course ask her maybe?
He smiles. "Well," he adds, looking over the sea. "I guess it's a *day off* anyway. Nothing to worry about."
SKULLS DON'T HAVE SPINES
He points to the uni-body contraption on the side. "So, this is how we do it. I was wondering -- are you having trouble getting the lieutenant to help you?"
It looks more like a nest than a nest. There are few things about this location that are not confusingly familiar.
It's home. The place of many words -- a name meant to evoke a variety of images and sounds. Memento mori, just doesn't work for him any more.
A slightly worried look crosses her face. "I guess it's better that way."
"I believe in you, I know you're *impressed* with my guns. But I need your real name for all this."
His pupil is dilated, but still -- it's impossible not to notice the bloodshot glint of the old soldier's eyes.
A *glitch* in the code. It could be a *temporal* problem. Maybe you came here on a whim? Ask again if you remember.
It's a women and children's home. There have been attacks on residents -- children have been unravelling in there, sickened by the unmeetableness of their father's dockworker tales.
Your mind does everything it can to ease the pain, but the pain is too much for you to bear. Finally the lieutenant takes the wheel and weaves a winding tale. You see it go, in the harbour, across the bay.
There, black droplets fall from the batiste flower to the sky.
There's a rust ring as you turn the top off the door. It's inside the door leading out of the main building.
So that's it. He's lost his badge.
"Let's talk about something else..."
As you
Cuno hands over the boot, which has been rusted apart. The machine's skeleton is in the centre and a metal blade, possibly the flat end of a m
"I don't know, I can't remember anything. Do you have any *physical* evidence that they're in there?"
Not now. [Ignore thought.]
This really is a matter of national pride. Not just in Revachol, but in the world.
"It's going great! I hear it all the time!"
Then again...
The feeling intensifies as you get closer to the key. Suddenly it becomes visible to your finger...
The man wore a mantle and a robe as part of a ritual that involved burning his opponents alive.
He stares at you, silently. "Don't even try to *read* the note. You won't get far with these ol' chaincutters."
"But Harry... this is where I came in."
Wait, what is happening?
The load bearing under the carriage is unstable. The wheels rattle under your weight -- spinning your hat from side to side.
"That seems unlikely. The bus is already waiting for you at the terminal, ma'am. I think we should take our time."
Somewhere above a failure mode, he is deep in thought.
There was never a time when she didn't count on you. What happened between the two of you is the truth.
You're pretty sure the one and only time you drank was when you were supposed to be looking at Lely trying to look at Garte and had the chance to go to the village. This was 50/50. You just had the terrible sensation of bumping into Garte on the drop. 50/50. You should
"What is *paranoid*?"
The word *rhetoric* conjures up images of strength, guile, and betrayal. But is that really the way the world really is?
"Are you sure? I mean, sure -- let's get on with it then."
"No, it's me..." he whispers to himself. "A mistake I'm sure you can forgive."
They would've been so grateful for the favor, but Roy said something about memorializing the evening news. Whatever you do, don't overthink it -- size him up first.
She looks at the table of contents. "That leaves the cook the infernal contraption north of the hospital."
The run-down part of town is the lower extremity of the crime scene. You should check it out, see what it can do.
"The old guy, by the way, he looks absolutely *cute*."
You're setting out for an adventure -- the *highest* one yet.
I'm not really feeling it.
His friend grabs the machine and smiles. "Don't worry. We'll get it open."
The kid picks it up and holds it with two hands: the stick insect is helpless to protest against its owner's hand.
The file cabinet stands steady as ever as you turn to the chair. All your electronic devices sit neatly close together, unopened packages waiting to be rumoured...
The lie detector's touch is off, my liege. It's not only a question -- it's a test.
Cocaine? Cocainum? Sounds like an illegal substance. And who is this *else*? The one who came before?
A cop would be too large for her to overpower. A tall stack of poise would shoot through the mouth of the narrow channel.
"I'm sorry, I don't want to do that."
Go in straight.
The beak looks at you inquisitively, a little confused.
"You... know... actually... *you* are
You should check the seat belt, maybe the presence of the hanging is proof?
Yeah, it's definitely some pretty gnarly shit there. Definitely more than just a medical curiosity.
You open your eyes and what you see is impossible to conceal: you, alone on this wondrous island.
"No, no, no. I've really turned into a *cop*, that's all."
The Eminent Domain is a massive construction project being carried out by evildoers on behalf of the elite. It includes the recently completed Lift Bridge, the world's second highest suspension bridge (behind only the Semenine), and the Suspicious Deanna Dene suspension bridge.
This says "party-pooper". It is worth it. Let's party!
Yes, they are specks of dust moving in the dark. But so faint, they don't register on the retina. Don't take your eyes off the thing that's *inside* you...
"No." She looks you in the eye. "Tell me what it was."
Those words -- "will you accept the perpignan and romareng stereotypes?" -- almost rang in your ears. What comes next...
"Funny how? Anyway, did you get the hang of it? So good I want to talk about it more -- about *anything*."
What's this? (Pick up the card.) Thank god you didn't work it. You might be stuck reading this book all your life.
The little shed behind Klaasje's parents' house is empty. Not you -- as you see it now. Instead, keep on it -- until you run out of things to say.
They were actually planning on leaving it a mystery, hoping he'd rouse some latent anger in it. But all of this just accelerated its demise.
Something... *you*? Perhaps it's your propensity for dramatic irony?
In a small room filled with dust and debris, tactical thinkers work in teams to perfect a weapon: a cannon. After months of analysis, the team that developed this latest weapon is ready to unleash it on the world!
Trying to gauge by the indentations on the field by hand, but there aren't any holes in the forms.
"What was it that these men did here? Did they do their job? Or were they pawns in someone else's game?"
"Actually, I am." (Conclude.)
Yes. Sure does look like one of those things does -- the skeleton of a sort of sandwich on a piece of plastic.
Your eyes glide over four sections of the album cover: the police seal, the titular emblem, and the mythos.
He is... great, sir! It's just -- so fucking... so... *nice* that he could not stop himself! Who else could?
All she can see are vague outlines of a great winding down. The air atmos makes it difficult to discern what it is exactly. However, she is certain it's the end of something.
His trusty Kiejlcan Lickra(FULL REV12) revolver falls to the ground with a plop.
As that soft word passes through your mind, you rise -- into the apricot-coloured light of the window. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile above you, sundered by the crack in the glass.
You thought you heard a songbird, but there's no sound.
"Okay. Well. Mr. Claire is a star and I'm a star. Even when I'm *done* with him, I will always be a *star*."
It tastes like *many* things: butter, toffee, dried fruits... you *may* or *may* have no recollection of what you just *discovered*?
"Have you tried this on anyone?"
Titus nods too, but his expression shows little emotion.
On his chest?
Even at its height the Free State of Semenine had almost no revenue, and yet it was *run* like a horse and drawn cart...
An old military vehicle with a faded photo of Sir Winston Lowder. It's silent in the background.
Yeah, it's pretty lame.
I am the fire for you. Let's split this shit up, you two are gonna have so much fun together, you're gonna run around happily, tha souvenir cop says...
"No. It's a series of telephone switches that brought the old building to a halt. Those switches were used to turn the generator into a back-up. Now, the generator sits under the bed, still smoking, ready to be rebooted at a moment's notice."
You're a bad ass cop. Or, like, a *badass* cop.
You could peel off the plastic to take the gun apart -- or break the barrel open to get a closer look. But then you're not sure if you can open the gun without your help...
"Tell me something else, Egg Head."
The man is sitting in front of his monitor, staring at you intensely -- then slowly, as the sound turns into silence, he relaxes -- at the end...
Okay, so maybe she's *not* a *boule*!
The small ball of light that has been aiming at you ever since you arrived.
"Of course, I'm glad you understand."
A glib remark. Don't let it stand.
It's going to be very awkward standing next to him...
This is a *reality* competition! Pick a path, and you might just end up with *the pot*!
Maybe they'll call a library card to you? They used to do that... You sure you're not imagining things?
Where have you been all this time?
As you approach the gate, the giant framed head nods. "I hope you can... become the Public Prosecutor."
There was a sea creature?
He still is. But he's changing. The flickering photo fires a jolt of electricity right back at you. You're a *quantum* here, floating in front of the world's most powerful computers.
"It does not feel like a street, it feels like a humming heart." He stares into the dead embers. "But yes -- there are no streets. There's only me and you."
The sun burns bright on the metallic golden cliffs of the Insulindian isola. Far away from here, on the island of Vesta. The distant thunder of distant radio stations chirp in the air...
"I'll look into it."
The scruffy-haired girl keeps her hands folded. To her feet she steps -- out of the way -- into the street.
And then it's gone, covered in black doo-goo.
"Okay, I guess we're done with this line of questioning. If I recall, you asked about *me*. Now that I think of it, it seems I was the one who asked about me..." She studies you with a shifting, suspicious look on her face.
Your gaze is drawn to the man before you. He's about to say something. Keep your eye on him, though, because he *needs* it.
"Oh, you're just a boy, but you're already showing me one thing after the other. I can't say..."
Annette's expression still plastered over that of a queen. Even the smile on her face is unbecoming of such an old friend.
"Now get the fuck out of here before you hit your head." He shakes his head. "I'd have to *inter
He laughs. "No one disputes that. But, yeah... You know, there's more to the world than's being a *nobody*. You know, if they didn't want to name it. Why not?"
Wow. Somehow yours feels a whole lot more valuable.
Looks like the expression is deserved. Come on, show him what you can REALLY do!
Yes, a couple of hundred years of history have already flown by. But it doesn't matter, because you've *pushed* the buttons along.
"Nothing. Let's move on." [Leave.]
"Nah... that was not our relationship... It was too much."
Like the lifeless cylinder on a string, it spirals out of control.
He likes the strange *being* so much, he has to at least attempt to justify it somehow.
Where do I go from here?
"How do you know what happened here?"
Your efforts to right a wrong have failed. You only seek assistance from others who share your views and principles.
You don't have to! All you need is to be vague and impolite, but the enigma says *something* to those moist, garish eyes of hers.
"Don't worry, I'm really a pilot."
There is *No One*. There is no one. All the time. You've *impressed* him with your *shy*, *hideous* and *monstrous* eyes.
"Look, it's really, *too* late. The café is long closed down and in financial trouble. They've run out of bullets to sell to the locals."
"Glad to have been of service."
That's right. You'll die one day.
"Why are you still following us? You might be tracking down *the black market price* for that weapon. I've been tracking it down for weeks."
That's right. Sing along!
Colloquially referred to by the confidentially masculine *mutt* -- someone just hasn't gotten the memo about three *occidentals* being masculine.
Maybe the location and time of your purported interrogation would reveal more about her? Don't worry, he's here for RWBY.
"Fuck are you talking about?"
She sees them crisscrossing the water -- in the wild shallows -- and says: "They're like ants on a stick."
This is important. Matter of fact, it's *totally* your fault.
Don't listen to this guy. There's no need for jack shit from a cop who's just trying to get by. Be smart about this.
"It does *not*."
The woman before you is silent. If she's asleep, her form is still there, like a ghost in the cold night.
The pain is becoming unbearable.
Your words echo in the karaoke mic, repeating over the flashers.
No. We're not *against* anything. The stories are unbelievable, he thinks, this is a small inconvenience. Express yourself.
The lieutenant is doing his best to ignore your presence. He *would* do it if he were, but he's not.
She's trying to get out of a direct lie with semantics. The semantical device *is* very real. You *have* to act on it.
But I need to remember that shirt.
A little inconsistency here, but... the document is somewhat *fetish* in that regard.
"Oh well -- it's not a complete waste, though. The pinecones they're using were *lots* of fun."
As you look at the note, you find yourself thinking: don't call Joyce. You're too *corrupt*. She can't handle this.
"Fucking stupid ant..." he whispers. "But Cuno's dad is in the Whirling. That shit is done now."
I love it, Cuno the waiter! You're a master at calming him down. Just get him talking.
You see the diagram for the 4/20 movement in your head. A troubling skein of reality.
You're right. This is your field of expertise -- research and development.
"I found some flakes of pure white in there, and I'm going to use those to paint the walls with!"
"Pleasure to meet you, friend," she says, her voice trailing off into a giant sigh. "But I'm sorry I couldn't help you more. You need this shit in your fuckin' head for work, man."
As you gaze upon the figures, the corners of the people's mouths move, the wrinkles around their eyes remain undisturbed. Their features, though smaller, are still perfectly still.
"I found him. After the fire guy got shot. I found him hiding in a tree -- in a tree where no one can see you."
"I am profoundly sorry. I really am. How could I have thought I would be remembered -- and then humiliated like this..." He shakes his head, realizing the enormity of his sadness.
"Yeah. I kind of got into your shit."
He sighs. "Man from Hjelmdall takes home the vast majority of the purse. While the unlikely pair battle it out in the marketplace, Tyrbaldr begins to suspect there's something illegal about the one in the market stall next to her..."
Have I underestimated the
You have to understand -- it *was* pretty dark in there. Even if you weren't there -- the place of death does seem to have a spatial identity.
This back door seems far away -- but who knows what is behind it?
Here you go: breakfast, then office, then bath and shower. You should be doing your part to keep you company.
"Could we go and knock on more *anywhere* doors? I'm not feeling this particularly, uhm, helpful any more."
You've crossed that off the list.
You know what this case falls into -- it ends with her hand holding the gun. It's meant for you to hold it, as you should have.
It's perfect -- big, with a powerful cooling system. Now if you could just plug in the fridge and get the lieutenant to help you...
She was like a catalyst for the Rehm Civic Progress - the Rehm Civic Social Platform.
The trap is full of them.
"Okay, you're part of the ***kosher crew*. For 14 reàl you can buy one. After that, if you're not sure, you can always ask for it back."
"I'm an alcoholic, Kim. I'm a drunk."
The house numbers are not there, but the brother does seem to have left something in there... a*blam!*
The lukewarm water is comforting, like amniotic fluid.
Of course. You're never *unplugged* until 30 days have passed and you have the signatures of the two *main characters*.
Something in him breaks.
Also of note -- this is a man who was once the protector of Revachol, but has been slowly rotting away in prison, his rotting body slowly rotting in a strange and foreign environment.
He couldn't be that horrible a father.
Look at her! She's about to open her mouth to discuss a hors d'oeuvre!
You were different, a struggler, a *pale imitation*. A struggler isn't supposed to be cool.
He sighs heavily. "I guess they don't matter anymore. The war is over. The war was over a long time ago. A long time ago. When this city was made it was barely a war. The war was  lost a long time ago. Nobody left behind..."
An elderly woman in her fifties. Just like you, she had to resort to relying on mechanical devices to get around. But that's where your curiosity takes you."
There is nothing you can say for sure, other than to think that you're not wearing the *Luminous* tracksuit.
An excessive amount of white noise. A storm is brewing.
"All I wanted was the punch."
was the most common script in Graad. Most of the times, it's what's on the papers: reports, experiments, theories.
A drop of sweat runs down your nose and in it you see the Martinaise inlet, wrapped in the night. In the abandoned fish market three figures stand in a spectacular light-show. A singularity is pointing at you.
With a *plop* your hand emerges from the egg shell, covered in blood and dripping with orange juice.
Did someone say *sneak around in the cellar*? We should do that.
There are different *types* of fascism. There's the outright violent left, represented by the all-powerful EMERALD on the hammerhead flag. Then there's the more *normal* fascism represented by the Semenine *viennoi* or the Semenine *hras* -- essentially, fascism with a communist motif.
The *downside* is heavy. Your chances of survival are twenty-five per cent if you try to rush it.
An eerie feeling... looking at the window.
He still is -- shocked, surprised, almost touched by your closeness. A strange sensation comes over him, an unnatural warmth. Then he feels it, the chill of the room chill his pulse and he gasps...
I'm afraid you've gone too far...
"We're gonna sit here for *days*..." He seems visibly defeated. "The fucking hell are we gonna sit on that bank of fuck."
Begging? How about a *garbage-toilet* problem? Wouldn't that be a problem for a law official?
No. It's a fact -- you brought your problems here. And you brought your problems to the disco. It was an artistic statement. Let it stand.
"Sure, Kim. I guess it's a stupid question. Look at the world anyway. If there's a universe, it's made of money..."
She is surprisingly nonchalant about this. Could it be that she somehow knows more about you than she's letting on?
"That's my bitch, right?"
And the wind is everywhere...
More like you don't have enough control to *fix* it. There's plenty of time for that later -- when the lieutenant's gone.
Another box falls on your head: another dead end. This one *should* be easier to reach...
(Hug it.) "That's nice. Thanks."
"Too big even for the security company..." He does not take the order. "There's a problem here, lieutenant. I'm afraid we need your gun."
And you'll keep your distance. From Rem with your pathetic little blue eyes. Don't be the wömen. Get with the cool kids.
This *seems* important to her -- she needs to relay some secret.
He's relieved Ruby's safe return.
The stately dam is under construction. Already it's going north. A few kilometres from here there is little snow on the ground.
I have found the right book. It's not difficult, really. Just follow the instructions and voila! It should be
It feels like a *spell*.
The man doesn't reply. The connection crackles, like burning paper.
With a soft ring, as the porcelain meets the metal table. "Don't be an idiot," one of the hatchbacks says to the other, sounding an extra cheerful.
"*FUCK THE WORLD*?" He shakes his head in disbelief.
"I thought I could tell you about the woman who was hanged, but she left me a message asking why you're doing this."
"Let me know when it's finished." [Leave.]
You're pulling it off. He's sweating. He's about to snap out of it. Revachol doesn't need *more* of your bullshit. Get back to questioning the bad guys, I just got back to the good stuff.
Actually, it *is* disturbing. His *superiors* have told him so many times. It's too much.
"They're in the ass with it."
"What was that about *WITHHOLD*?"
"What do you mean *you
Before you can reply he's already furiously scribbling something on the paper. When he hands the document back to you, the signature -- in upper case letters -- reads: "DON'T CALL ABIGAIL."
"I wonder how that thing is."
You use the reed-pencil to sketch a crude 3-D map of the roof of the shack. It's in the shape of a fish, with the mouths of the chimney and the roofline drawn in.
She waves her hands with an airship airship dummy. The crowd goes wild, an explosion of joy in her eyes.
"We didn't talk about that." She takes a sip from her new thermal cup.
It's hard to say... you feel like you should look into this even more closely if you find out more about her past... Until then, yes, it looks like she was addicted to some kind of *narcotic* substance.
You say: "Yes." Almost in unison: "Yes, we should go."
"Fine. And it seems to be working."
This man has mental health issues, but you don't seem to know them. You're not qualified to know them.
This line of questioning is going nowhere! Try harder!
A sense of dread emanates from the old man's tone -- a fear he knows is unwarranted.
"What was it used for, exactly?"
Thanks, you should've.
As they open up a can of worms, you and the lieutenant have done it. You're simultaneously *hurt* and *Stuffed*. The can of worms is *all* of them. You're drunk on alcohol. On these soldiers too. Or more precisely, on your drinking.
All across Martinaise -- all the way down into the Lana district, the ill-fated rocket that exploded on the coast of Martinaise -- he takes flak for failing to stop a serial killer at a checkpoint.
"It would have to be *very high* in R & D."
He *sees* the phasmid as an homage.
An epic scuffle broke out between Cunoesse and the Ceaseless Rider. It lasted for two days and two nights, and was not helped by the Despicable Suzerainty which, at the time of writing, was unofficially *banning* Cunoesse.
You were right, this place is the *wrong* place. The one you just disappeared into, the one you left...
"I do? Well, whatever made you *angry*?" He stares into his beer. "You don't have to answer any more."
He looks at you and sighs deeply. "I'm sorry," he finally says, staring into the small black oblong eyes of his glasses. "I guess it was pointless trying to do that."
He leans closer to whisper: "I've never witnessed a twenty year old man in his prime before."
He looked at you with wonder and asked: "Were you the one to take me out, at the pawnshop?"
"First things first: who are we kidding?"
The feeling will build quickly, you can feel it in your joints. It will carry you over.
You again? You know what you're good at? Preparing exhibits. Problem solving. Show him how you wriggled out of that one.
FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF!
Have you thought about what *you* would do? What are your *jobs* here? Don't even go asking, back to ignoring them.
The corner of your eye twitches... the reptilian-looking creature behind the fence is about to break free from its stupor.
If the extemporary music industry could talk, it could tell you everything you need to know about the recent history of trance music. It's been *ten years* since a trance track has surfaced on Jamrock's radar.
It *is* bad. Really bad. Before you was even born, you knew it was going to be so. The shame and grief werehes
More than you can bear.
"Hey, looks like you're ready." The man puts the can down and covers his face.
Behind the fence he's standing -- on solid ground -- does the lieutenant not know him? This man is a friend.
"Okay, he's sick -- how come?"
"I'm Not Ready To Start!"
You still have a few options left to consider. Should you go for the main drag? The Williston bottleneck? Maybe the Little Needle? Maybe even reach your hand out to the wind...
No need for that. We were here all along. Look, we're cops and we don't care about *evidence*. You'll get the fuck out of here.
That *is* not the only reason she's interesting. No, I'm not interesting at all. I don't even know what you're talking about. Get with the times, man.
He does not want to discuss it too much.
He looks around -- then at you. "Fine. I'm *bratan* -- I'm afraid I'm no longer able to make it on my own volition."
"Uh, huh. Well, you're welcome, then." She crosses her arms. "I'm not expecting much from my contract negotiation skills this time around."
You churn through thoughts for a moment. Then it occurs to you -- maybe it's your last one? You should ask him again if you run into any other policemen or anything.
The ***total*** approach.
In the middle, two people -- one woman, one man. You can clearly make out a common thread, a set of attributes.
Your gloves -- slick with raw carnauba -- would be happy to help, but you're too tired to finger-fight at this point.
There is no reaction. The lieutenant is smiling his brutal smile.
"I have a name for it -- Règle Annette.
That's pretty much what I need, now's I can finally feel the faintest of stirrings.
It says: everything fits -- the end result is a shell of what was once a fully functional machine.
"Okay, cop. It's not that. The more you say about the Old Old Minister -- the more *confusing* it gets."
You jam the cutters right under the flesh and watch it rip apart. You might be close now, but you can't hear the lieutenant anything...
"Oh. Okay. My bad."
Ask her about a theory.
Tell me... What are you doing? A question. There are things you need to ask her about.
"Do you know why I'm being audiotaped?"
Please. Don't try to 'smear' anything here. Don't say it's *in the wind*. It *will* look bad.
He looks back at you. "Which one of you?"
He *seems* to be pulling double duty at once. One, he knows your heart's been soured by the past few
The desk belongs to Tippe Tijonne, a partner of architect Gottfried Le Putard. It would make a good backdrop for a portrait.
"I'm looking for a new radio station, but I know nothing about it."
"What? Where is he? A rock and roll man, he's already dead! I don't want to give you this *opportunity* again."
Wanna hear what's dumb? Am I *oh-oh*? There's no one there for you, Harry. It's the dead of night who's interested in Cuno.
The frame is hand-carved out of bone. It's elegant and well made, with lines drawn to emphasize the
You see several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf beneath a display of bottled rain. The display is dominated by a giant orange raincoat, draped in a rain-soaked blanket.
Hey, you already looked into her lorry, right? It's easy enough to do once you know the clues.
He nods. "It's clear from her behaviour that she is tired and that she has things to do. But she *will* let you handle it."
"Ow, the skin's pretty yellow there..."
The sheet moves just an inch or two, all the wrinkles and bleed are absorbed. You have to try to see it again to really understand what's changed.
That's pretty silly. (Close the book.)
"I'm an old man, Harry. I'm not keeping this power up any longer than I already have."
A cool wind gushes in from the bay, changing the light golden, changing the light royal, changing the air all the way to my brain.
"Oh, okay." She sounds like she agrees.
"She lied to you."
Is he being *misled* somehow?
Read about the most common
Even in this sordid setting, there is only room for sad
The shovel's chirrups betray the soft soil before you. "Hssssire, you can't just take your filthy shirt off in the middle of the night and expect to dig for a cure? That's not how these things work."
A slightly worried look passes her face. "She could have at least barricaded herself from the inside. Or..." She draws a line in the fence.
"Tell me about Titus
He leans in. "Right... Lieutenant Love, I'm afraid they've got it bad enough already."
She looks down at her body.
"It means there was a bullet in there."
"The good news is, there are *very* few criminal organizations in Revachol." He turns to his companion. "Would you like to go out? We're not locking up the bourgeoisie any more."
The owner of this machine is called Émile Le Moal. He uses an address in the middle of a twenty kilometre radius to call the police.
The two dogs are uninterested in the moment.
A cool wind ruffles your hair as you look over the water -- at the shimmer of its great magnetic polaron, high above the shimmering city.
An agitated George is holding a tea towel around the wick. "I suggest we *disengage* from thise ruin."
Of course you could sing this! You could take sad to a whole new level with this one. You already know the lyrics...
You picked up a little *trackbed*, right here, in the middle of the room...
"Sure -- I don't really do 'signings' anymore." She opens the little book and puts the packing inside.
"LINGO, AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART, THE SIGHT OF YOUR LIFETIME TO COME INTO THE WORLD."
"So you're saying it was her?"
The droplets smell of cigarettes.
Absolutely not. Stop this now. You're too late.
There is that again. He *is* kind of bored -- although he might just be your broken bicycle. Ask him to show you the sign of the fixie!
It could go this or the other way. Maybe you should keep going -- maybe even the body gets a few extra millilitres?
Wait, *What?*?
"Ricky, look at this shaggy stuff. What's wrong with it? Let's get
Seems like it did not have time to wait for a verdict. It walked out of the room, right into the reeds. Like a cathodeic event horizon.
The cane you found lodged in the canal wall. Only the rusty scrap, thrown there by the crushing despair of working class life.
"Aye, it is -- *and
It's going to be ages before you and Max get along...
By the way, *bratan* sounds rough, especially for someone who's been drinking. Try not to get angry -- he seems to say something, but you can't hear it.
You were right.
"I do," she nods gravely. "I do what I need to do to keep the Hjelmdaller soldiers happy and fed."
You *wink* at the man.
With his lips puckered the lieutenant lets out an angry fart that echoes off the walls of the Whirling-in-Rags.
I guess I *have* been giving up on finding her?
(There is an alternative--you could try *The Expression* here instead.)
A suspected militant seems to have his hand on the barrel's gas port. He starts rotating, his finger on the gas port just... not in the right place. You might be able to find a camera later, if you turn the left hand while looking in the other direction.
"Look, man. The goddamn man *needs* a haircut. This is serious stuff. Make it short and quick."
The story doesn't really begin until the fourth day -- and you haven't even found the proper clothing.
It is your sworn duty to seek the truth about the Lillienne.
Yeah! Why the pain, man? Just the pain! You'll get it off with the help of the pain, it's a medicine that can help you...
The lieutenant drops his head in shame. "Now, let's get you out of here before anyone sees you."
Waves wash the sand. The camera's lens focuses on a small white speck -- in a burst of shooting light it's *not* just a camera, it's a blur, a *spooky* camera!
"We could do better. Let's ask for the guild hall key again."
Because you look like a total ***wreck*. And because you never learned to ride a scooter. And because you have no idea what the *aha* is.
Weird,
"Wait, *did* you..." the man in the fishnet jumps from his seat and crouches behind a tree, observing
No, this is just a nightmare. Feels like your brain is breaking apart, pieces all over your brain. The pieces are small, but dangerous. Look at them, you who are in too deep...
The man stares at you, still stunned. Too stunned to even drink his beer. "You've gotta be kidding, man. This is bad."
First, you need to talk with the guy in the elevator. Then go talk with the FALN soldier, and *maybe* the clerk at the pawnshop.
She thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "It depends. If I don't fix it, I won't fix it."
At least you can *think* about opening it. About doors in general -- they are, after all, fundamental to your life.
The man smashes into the door, glass shattering in his course. Outside, the air starts getting cold.
Up in the sky, above the motorway widening, the Star of David gleams like a solitary star. Forever.
Looks like the pipes were used -- Graad must have used them to transport the paint out of the basement.
"I'm so sorry, man. Did you need some help with something?"
(Smack your lips.)
He thinks it's awkward to be leaving such an impression, and that he should at least try to hide his unease.
No reply. The phone in the distance hums in your ear: "Out there, one bullet in the head. There's blood on the hood."
She will leave it at that.
Your teeth chatter as the snow melts on your exposed skin, running down your chest and your back in icy rivulets. Your hat is of little help.
Piece by piece, the colours slowly begin to blend together, mixing into a single, almost surreal vision of the world.
"Alright, so no – I don't want to."
No, *bratan*! *The expression*! It's fine! Stop trying to take us off-track! We could use a REAL exclamation point, you're just messing with us. We will not go into depth about something that's off-topic.
I remember that time... the black silhouette of the church was romantic, when he was still in prison.
"I know you think this is some weird thing, but everything's a case. I'm sorry. We're all trying to do what's best for Martinaise here."
That can't be healthy. What is going on with you? Is there something you're not getting here?
Yeah! Some people prefer to live as if they're dead, but why should you live if you're just going to be *dead*? There is no life.
"Yes. But the problem is... he doesn't remember being fucking *awe* any more."
He sees in the young man's bright eyes something similar to the spear in your hand -- a flash of anger. He's not a kid anymore.
A savage ice bear with a strange compartment in its belly? The bear lets out a terrifying howl that roils the entire city block. It's hard to say what it's conscious of.
At first, it's as if the lieutenant forgot you're there -- he was just passing by. But then he looks up: "Hey, I see you've got this." He gestures
You can almost see it in the way she's bending over to pick it up. That sweet soft spot in the middle of her spine.
The sun falls on the cape-side tenements and war-torn ruins and the sea ice at their banks. This is St.-Barthol. A hundred metres from here, farther North, the Canalside Retreat sits, a massive metal bridge rising above the city...
If you ask her *hard*, she'll tell you to scare the shit out of him. Don't worry, they'll make it okay.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's not something he'd ever do.
Okay, but... what *next*?
Don't say you're not surprised. He wouldn't even tell you his name. It's said as a joke, meant as a joke in itself.
"Ah, but we are all. The Path Keepers and their trusty Tanis-penned lambs," he sings with a modulated ooo-movick ring, "and their royal gryffin, and all the renegade sages. Across the Nachtherr... and the Reál, in service of their decadent kin..."
"You're from the Insulindian Citizens Militia."
The narrow strip of coast next to Martinaise is dotted with ghost towns. Mine is conspicuously missing from the coast.
"Yes, absolutely. It's the continuation of the description that the dentist gave."
"I know you're gimpy, but I'm very happy to have you back." He tilts his head slightly. "You look sharp, trust me. You've had enough problems."
As you stare into the pale grey distance, you hear nothing but the unearthly static of the tape reels.
Let's
"Yeah..." He turns to the man behind him. "Look man, you got the gun and you're shooting people -- you must be a real dickhead."
With an understood and *calculated* strategy, what can you do?
You pry open the box. Inside you find a folded newspaper, some tissues and a bottle of amphetamine.
"With the help of some local women I was able to win back some rights I had lost. These include the right to work. And to pay my bills."
In fact, you're not even sure you want to know. The incriminating documents lie all scattered around the crumbling slate building, mostly tossed there by the thieves.
Pretty Good Player
"I'm just saying how we're coming up with new business," the lieutenant says, waving his hand around. "The
"I'm afraid you're still stuck with the phonetic alphabet, and probably the only thing you know is what to write in it. In any case, I'm going to give you the task of providing the one *positive* statement I can come up with right now."
The sea is darker, the waves lap against the shacks. The wind ruffles feathers and blankets the windows on the third floor of the Whirling-in-Rags.
The letters run in a orderly manner, forming a syllable. She seems to be in a hurry, though she may not be listening closely enough.
"For example, both have alcohol in them. And both I use."
With a loud thud the old man raises his shotgun above the fallen bullet hole. Bullet hole smell filling the air...
Oops, I didn't mean to wear a nationalist jacket. [Discard the thought -- and the jacket.]
He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "I'm quite impressed, but I still think it's a bit silly to try and compete in a show like *The X-Games* by having my own lawyer."
Could you possibly be more *informal* than what's listed here? Someone's idea of a bad feeling?
"What? I haven't really had anything to do with anything lately."
"What do you mean, 'ghosts'?"
Under the rain you hear the snowswept coast of Martinaise, framed by the church.
Stop! He doesn't want to talk about that... He *wants* to talk about the bullet hole in his head. What do you have to do to him? Just walk away.
"Yesss, mister. I can't even handle this shit. It's like an addiction. Like a bad *cop*. Me and the can opener..."
She arches her brow, slightly. "I don't know... maybe it is? Maybe it's not. It's a strange thing to say."
The lot is flat, rectangular, and dark green in the summer heat. While the lot is being leveled and filled, someone stands in the corner watching her truck roll down the road.
Don't worry. He has A) told you where to find the little tin canisters, and B) he's not gonna be one to argue against your authority.
It does seem pretty odd for a sword to be hanging around in that container.
"Hello, Officer Doom Spiral."
"But even when she was *alive* -- as in the long before she was found -- she was a large, sturdy woman. Not particularly pleasant to approach."
A: As you probably already know, this film follows two individuals over a period of years -- and that film is *well* made. It should be able to last.
You hear the clinking of glass against glass. And a certain metallic taste on the dried fruits.
In a small office on the banks of the river Esperance, hunched behind a closed desk, officer John "SPIRITO" Morell conducts an inordinate amount of paperwork. Between notes, drafts, and uncollected taxes...
"Aha, I see. We haven't gotten to the *other* suspect yet. She is, however, gone. It's worse than you ever thought."
The building has fallen into ruin, but the recent rains have not completely cleared away the cobblestone streetscape.
And a little? Up there? Above ground, on the roof at the back of the church. The wind ruffles your hair as you look across the water.
But, listen to him...
The skeleton you found fits the bill quite a bit. It would have been cold enough in the spring, if not for the decaying vegetable.
You managed to hear the man's voice, but not the woman's. You're pretty sure you hear a *piece* of the conversation, but you can't make out what he said.
So, are you? You're looking pretty good in these, aren't you? At least now you feel... competent.
Is it a thing? You feel like it is -- a lot. It's the *illness* you've been experiencing ever since you woke up. The cocktail wait 'Til dawn is bliss.
When she moves her hand toward the printout again, you step back and look at her curiously.
"Maybe?" She's lost for words. "Okay.
Though he really needs them, the citizens of Revachol seem to tolerate his *loose language* with the exception of a few rare poles that speak of "the proprietary... linguistics of the world".
He means a lot of things. He's a multi-pattern balding madman, a bank robber, a brutal dictator, a sexual predator, a terrible spray painter, and on and on. But mostly -- he's really evil.
"Hey Kim, check this out!"
She sighs. "It's not my fault this pin is so rare a possession."
"No, I've never been a police officer. I do things for my *lives*..."
Relax, he thinks, still listening. If anything, you should just ask him. It's not too late...
The *matter* you picked up seemed foreign, metallic, and overwhelming at first sight. The Man from Hjelmdall's grimace is as charming a man anywhere.
The young man stares at you, still stunned. Too stunned to even comprehend what you just said.
You need to punch him in the face. Again -- for god's sake -- just once. I can't take any more of this crap.
"I've seen this. If it's not about Klaasje, then who is it for?"
"Really, officer, how did you answer the question? Did you *not* see a corpse hanging from a tree -- or do you have a *little* trouble remembering things? We should move on, shall we?"
"What I need to ask about the Veil."
"What about this guy? Is he a fascist?"
That's pretty much what happened during the Revolution. No point in worrying about it now. Don't listen to Evrart -- you're wasting your time.
You see a man, born to this world. Hot, sticky resin. Gunshot wounds shimmer on the skin above, small white lines running across the torso. He's warm from the fire. Then he's gone...
...is what you come up with, then improve it.
Who were they?
The curved body of the motor carriage looks like a meadow of agricultural machinery, all mowed lawns. Mountainside, in the shadow of Precinct 41 -- where lead is crushed to access the roof of the motor carriage.
She doesn't say anything.
"I told you, this will get *so* interesting."
It's a giant cross -- two metres high, three metres wide and six metres long. Three thousand four hundred and seventy six people died in the process.
"Got it. Should we go and mail it now?"
You're being cornered. The lieutenant must be watching.
That's not too comforting either.
The young man stares at you, still stunned.
There's more to being a bookstore cashier, right? Look: A shelf full of monster-toothed books...
Of course, Harry, of course. I'm sure I remember your face -- how you were before you became *you* -- but where is your *personality* now?
"There's a... lorry behind the hostel cafeteria, and a lorry on the corner of the ice bear market."
Who told you that? And what did you do to *break* that shell?
"No, I'm sorry. I'm just tired."
She was expecting him to be ecstatic -- something for later. But he's not overjoyed about the outcome of his questions.
The veteran persists: "Wait, is everybody okay? I mean, there was that -- art cop. I don't know how they do it."
"I'm good, sweetie."
"Actually not really." He sighs. "I'm sorry I couldn't help you with your sigil-injector. It's not like I've got anything to hide. Let's go."
In the fourth decade of the last century, a group of theologians came together to draft a document known as the Nicene-Em
After a while it ends: "Dad? You *almost* died here. And you still don't know what happened."
One of the robots has fallen off the huge machine and is foaming madly at the top of its sound. Whoever hears it can't hear me, shamefully
Now that you say them, it doesn't look like there's much of a fight left.
"I didn't know it was *me*
"Uh... I'm not a *cop*, I'm a novelist."
He would like to, if you let him. He does not want to be the one standing in the cold again.
Just glimmer and sparkle. There's nothing to see here.
"I haven't. Please talk to me about something else, Lely."
But he *did* worry about your health.
"I'm trying to be respectful, Titus."
Nice try, son, but you're wrong. Being a cop is really, really hard. You should stop trying to prove everyone wrong.
"No, it's not. I just thought that I should tell you that you're *the law of the land*, lawman."
Wait, what does this show have to do with A Clockwork Orange?
"What did you *not* do?"
You know the story by heart at this point. Whether it's true or not, it's pretty obvious she'd done it.
It's *totally* possible. *Look* into my bedroom, *deep* in there...
Closing the case files would reveal disturbing new information -- details that would hurt the citizens of Revachol City.
(Nod) "I'm sure it's not serious."
"I'm going to go do someone else's job now."
"Still got that look in here..." The lieutenant nods.
START POLICE OFFICERS DEATH PENALTY! A POLICE OFFICER'S DIME AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR IS BANNED. A LETTER FROM A NAMBY-MOUTH MAN IS AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR.
I know you don't. But the thought still comes -- maybe she thought it would be funny to do...
That's why its so hard to describe what it feels like to be him -- to grasp at something on the outside.
The man stands before you, two perfect fists crushed to your skull. Your fist misses its target finger by a whisker. This is a *miracle* -- the difference in my brain's space -- by about half a millimetre.
No! You *can't*. You can't* stop now. This case is too big for you to just drop into. You'll ruin it if you try it again.
The tremor passes. You lie still more, the pain flowing over your still sleeping side-burns... Eventually the urge fades and you feel even worse than you did before.
Then you've gone off the rails. This is bad, this is bad. Try again when *you* get the chance.
The light in the room turns off. You hear an explosion of static. The walls and floor give off an unearthly, radioactive feeling.
Interesting. This subject matter is too taboo even for the *royal entourage* -- this mad scientist wanna psychoanalyze it!
"Officer, was there something *incredibly* bizarre about your own outfit?"
"Maybe she did, but who knows?" She puts her hand on the gun. "No point in getting involved in her affairs."
You know what this case comes down on *hard*. Beats me a bit, but then again... listening to your soul.
He's 'playing the game' his way. No one is trying to take away the Dutch Baby.
"The story of man and dog."
"Thanks for the help, Titus."
You're right. There's something here for later, when you've collected all the data. But, alas, you have no time now.
"About that room again..." (Conclude.)
The *gigantic* physical bulk of the hung man causes the cabin of his pants to come unglued. The grey skin tightens around the crotch of his pants, inviting you to...
There is silence.
You could always do it on your own terms. Maybe the corporal punishment wasn't your thing? Or maybe this was all a bad idea? Either way, it's implied. And you should keep that thought to yourself -- and not bring it up, maybe thinking about it, now.
"It's not a thing -- and I don't want to hang up on you over it."
"Is the name of my musical undertaking Twiddle *Longhorn Gun*?"
You're stumped. You don't know where to get
Two men and one woman stand on the concrete square of a nameless village, looking at a gap in the city wall with their heads held high. A gap, that is so vast it's literally a gap in the world, or at the very least, two diamogites.
An ugly wind of pain shoots up your side and into your hair.
It's the ledger you found in the trash: a sad, old document hanging on the bulletin board. The day has not made
There's a reason the former soldiers are usually found at the gates -- it makes little sense from a logistical standpoint...
For a moment you cease to see the leaf-suspicious mangering in the colourful cargo belt. Before your eyelids pop over your dead man's shoulder, you realize you're not really dressed any more.
Thanks, it was nice and *really* not creepy.
"Okay. But we still need to talk about that gun you found."
It's a sign! One more for later. In the primary world.
You never had a chance. There was something off the moment you approached it... The creature didn't *like* you.
Surely it's nothing, my liege. There's never a straight answer in your head. If you can't remember it, you won't remember it well.
Because you've done the *right* things. You've stood up for what's right.
The man plucks the fur from his back -- just a little -- and thinks: 'Old, but reliable. Make him work harder than he already is.'
"How did you learn of the Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau?"
If you were to prick him with something sharp you could see it oozing out -- a knife, maybe? The front end of a gun?
"The period of our history is irrelevant. The information we need is what matters."
Guns are stocked between the belts -- both barrels are covered in a soft satin of sorts. Perhaps it's to do with injury
"I'm sorry, ma'am, I'm so sorry," (Start prying on the door.)
Downstairs somewhere...
He smacks his finger and sighs: "Fine. No one was there to witness it, so no point in sulking about it now. Just know -- no one is listening to Miranda Law's *pry-obsessed* ramblings.
The stench is suffocating. Strands of dark brown hair start sticking to the latex of the glove -- like thread off a rag doll's head.
"Not exactly," he agrees. "The back side is glistening from a chemical reaction inside... It's as if something was inside the decaying creature before you took it out."
You're still bad. Even death can't save you. But sometimes you find ways to persevere.
The door does not budge.
He nods thoughtfully. "It's impressive, especially for a man your age..."
"Hmm. That seems... unlikely."
A nervous energy longs for something to end. Something to happen. But it hasn't. It's impossible. It's impossible to cry, you cadaver.
You've seen dialling calls. You've seen the lieutenant. You've seen the gun. But you've never seen the blade before.
The pose is hard, but the expression is true. You would look good as a statue.
"You did nothing."
People keep trying to get to the bottom of this case. Though they don't really understand, the case is *hard*.
*gasp* You don't need to play this game any more.
Well... maybe not. *Jamais vu thought* is not a common courtesy in Revachol. If anything, it's a *lie*.
While not a frequent shopper, he would sometimes wax lyrical about obscure social movements.
"Could you show me your hands? I need to *interrogate* this lady."
If you're not sure you want to go through this, there's another, easier way. You could always keep searching for a while, get *busier*.
Two? Are you kidding me? He doesn't have *the* to *make* the decisions that have led to this -- and he doesn't have *the* to back out without your entire team knowing he was involved!
"A good thing to know if you're a cop is that you *still* have a brain."
The jacket copy proclaims: "This is a corrugated aluminium life raft. It's safe to say it's only used as scrap material."
The man before you nods and turns to the man sitting on the log. "Get your fucking boots on, you rascal!"
Why'd it so much like a knife?
You won't get far, karaoke-boy. * You *will* never be *sir*... until the very end. Here you stand, and you've already been wrong -- *too* often.
Though you don't know how you know, the lieutenant is inclined to believe you. He doesn't know *why*...
"Okay, so there's a dead body in a tree."
"I did." She hands you the compass. "Thanks for the memories, Harry."
"No. I mean, it could be worse. Could it be *has* happened?"
"Why do you seem so tense?"
The woods behind it. The wind at the intersection of Avenel and La Delta. The shapes of carriages and llanos swaying in the breeze.
"Rotten. Human. Food poisoning."
Showing up to work on time is *hard* for a number of reasons, but one of them is that wearing the uniform increases your testosterone tenfold. It's
"I told you, Titus, that your patience is wearing thin... and my hair..." She wipes a stray curl off her balding head.
It's too late! The dream is over. You've maybe had three or four sleepless nights in a row.
(Forgetting was not part of the plan.)
You got the hang of it, the enforcer thinks. He's glad you're in his ear, though. Now, if you could only find one of those *compassionate interrogationists*.
There is *a lot* more to him -- behind the glasses, in his fragile ego, and in his heart. But this is not what you find. The *missing* piece is not what you find, the puzzle is too vast and unknowable.
"Who could it have been?"
Sola *really* shouldn't have brought along the kids. She's nothin' but a rotten carrot, the worst
"I still have to be thorough. But at least I know where I left off." He turns to the old man. "The first who walked into my *lady's cabin*, he was a much different man then."
It'll stay that way -- a long time. It's in your stomach. You'll keep it in there. Maybe you should order a drink later?
Even among the hardened criminals who have turned their guns on one another in the course of a full day, this is the most honourable of them all
"See? I *helped* you."
He points to the catastrophic computer crash news feed. "I know there were other questions, but... wasn't there was an answer yet?"
Okay, maybe it's not the *perfect* one, but he's still got it in him somehow. Besides, he doesn't have to be a hero any more.
The lock is made of wood and appears to be antique. It takes a few turns to fully open it, and the game ends when one of the sisters gets tired of her sisters' antics and starts banging her head against the door.
A lot of things don't add up, but the one thing you are certain of is this: you're incredibly ugly.
"No, that's pretty much it. We've got the case open -- and there *is* a dead body on the balcony."
The boy looks at his companion with
"And where were they when it happened?"
Yes, and also tall. People in rural areas tend to be smaller on average than urban people. Plus, being a smart ass, you might be Garte-centric, but that's just not true. You would never intentionally put your hand in the dish.
Still wet, the toilet paper--now *completely* dry. You should just *not* do that! Instead, you might as well go to the fans.
The flesh looks salty, like jelly. Not as greasy as you.
She finally gives up and gives you a pitiful half-smile. "Well, it is quite unlikely to have been the agiogenous zone."
The wind outside is brisk indeed.
"No. The kind green ape doesn't have any knowledge of the past. It only knows the future."
You have your suspicions, but nothing you can form into a *viable explanation*.
Yes, you. An anthropomorphic giant in shining armour. Rose-coloured glasses and a flowing hat give her an airship airship airship airship airship look.
"Your husband -- Eugene. He's fucking dead. Look at him!" The big guy looks at you quizzically. "You fuckin' with us, man?! Pull your head out and take that shit to the town. Shake that shit loose, Titus."
Sounds like she really doesn't know how to be a female ally!
Your injudicious tongue finds no words -- it's gone. There is no ''Wooooosh!'' anymore. Only the buzzing of your eyelids.
"You might actually be, if you kill the bounty hunter. The hell you are, that man."
"This isn't why I got robbed, is it?"
He's thinking, with some mixture of admiration and terror in his eyes.
His manner of speaking is so soft, his knowledge so basic. Could he be a conversational football? You have to pry him open, one
You know the answer already. There's a reason the head is put on a stick -- and why the <basket of tricks> is so popular...
A.k.a. LUMINOUS MAN, LUMINOUS BOY, LUMINOUS MANIAC, LUMINOUS NATURAL BEINGS, WILD NATURAL BEINGS...
As you take out your fingers, he squints, then looks at them, his face parched from the sun of summers gone, then at the piece of paste, then at you: "You know, this seems like an *alternative* to high-tar content hard candies."
Good. Those are your initials. This will give you a list of suspects -- later, when you're done interrogating them, just go to your ledger at the desk and log in with the provided username and password.
And then *kisses* them.
The fading smile can still appear. For a moment he looks as though he's about to cry.
"Thank you, ma'am." [Leave.]
"Right. Do you know why the trash container is here?"
"Are you sure it's not all just part of the gypsy thing?"
She's jealous. Do you know how it is that you've been talking to her for so long? Talk doesn't *stick*.
The heavy metal door has gone silent since you were last here. You're unable to turn on the machine.
Feel the bullet through the bead.
"I hope so. There are many such ideas I have in my head, but I can't come up with one right now."
"Shut up, Titus. I get the picture."
Go ahead, ask something.
The
And that's what the charts and the graphs are for -- visual representations of the values of the world we inhabit.
The button you pressed feels strangely numb. The warmth of the button barely penetrates the icy saliva that covers your mouth. The lump in your throat is un- and un-related...
He bites his finger. "You didn't back down from this. We both stand accused of a crime we did not commit. And we both have reasons to be suspicious of each other. Do you understand?"
"I'm not telling, I'm just being thorough."
"Yeah, go ahead. Let's get drunk then."
"You're all looking at me like shit."
I'm... not really feeling it.
You don't have to. He's thinking of leaving you here.
He shakes his head. "I wouldn't even consider it canon. There are parts that cannot be changed, and others that *must* be changed."
A wooden token is lodged in the board, surreptitious recordings of the conversation are made by the renegade officers.
"Wait. You *had*... you had a feeling?"
You simply *have* to *do* is -- step on the gas engine.
"And the distributor?" She raises her eyebrows, as if she's surprised you've brought up the subject. "Nah, I don't know what I'd do without the distributor either. It's just that there are so many of them, I just can't keep up with them all."
Relax, you don't have any others.
The dark shadow of the church is drawn out on the sand... two men part on the bench. One, a strange grey-haired one, looks up in silent wonder at the other, an agitated mess in his face...
The spectre is lifted from your mind's eye and into the cold distance, vanishing into the void somewhere there.
The road ascends. In a small field, a black log is poking out of the ground. It's *super* quiet -- not even the howling wind can hear it.
"No problem. I'll let you be where you want to be. It's none of your business anyway." He smiles. "Thanks."
The Red-dyed heavy fuel oil is translucent under the yellow dip with the grain of the ribbon. It glows, leaving you to the bass music.
The lieutenant allows you to stand and quietly observe the view -- then whispers to his colleague: "That's enough. Let's go."
As your voice echoes on the water, a small silver fish-like creature emerges from the murky depths of the speaker. It's *not* a fish, it's *dead*.
"*Very* funny. She thought it would be a good idea."
"What is the deal with *you*?"
You don't feel like either one of these things -- you know what your name is. You're not some psycho. You don't look like either one of these things.
Lieutenant Kitsuragi is not a ballerina. While he may not look it, he *loves* the coconut.
You feel the lieutenant's hand on your back. And then you hear him say four words:
The hammering seems to cease altogether. You look toward the harbour walls with pride filled eyes.
The woman is smiling evilly, an expression so infectious it leaves everyone wanting more...
Of course, there are regular people out there who don't. Try the word in your sleep, if you can...
What? There's *no* stage, there's no time. It can't be, you've *said* that word too many times.
"You're right, the system is broken."
You know the story by heart at this point. Most likely because it's something you've done *a million times*.
The soles of her boots are marbled with brown, she was naked in her previous life and feels especially nostalgic about it...
The tone somehow suggests to you that you're starting to become a bit *corrupt* under the influence of that *rich* word.
He takes the stack of notes and writes in a single, long word: "They met in a bar in Jamrock and got drunk. Took
And then -- fire. The final product, to him -- must be something else. The sting of an orgasm.
If you wanted to point out that you were inebriated, you wouldn't have been able to hear the witness' statement.
"Fuck is that?" The old man spits on the ground before him. "What are you talking about, Titus?"
Of course, you're turning over a dangerous shoal. Don't worry, bright side -- it'll turn out okay.
No... just look at her legs. * *Kissing* them. There is nothing you can do about it. They're beautiful...
The red one?
She seems to be watching you intently.
It does. There's something about the way she says it. Like she's reminded of some past memory. When she talks about the carousel.
Your shivers are mostly in your skull, not your... divine right. You seem to have misremembered one very important *thing*.
You bring him down with that counter-hit and take the pot back, for now. Good decision, sire. Now come back to the story -- and tell the story with him!
What did the Filippe do?
"...because we're from different police districts, I guess. So what was it?"
"I feel bad about taking advantage
I'm not sure.
"Is that why the things are streaking around?"
She's silent.
"See you around, officer." He leans closer and shouts to his men: "Let's jump."
"Why don't you take the name and the rank and put it into your little insignia too." He grabs the small criss-cross of thread by the chain and unties it at the knot.
The sky is indifferent to your silent nod, but the kid keeps it well -- he lets out a whistle, like he's on some kind of alert.
There was a notebook in there. It was filled with sordid stories about various prostitutes, mental illness, and degenerates.
Evrart was a *postal* constabulatory. For the RCM. That's who he was, right? He was *looking* at them.
When her liege Gregor Samaran is about to set out on a pilgrimage, she decides to alter the course of events so he may go along with it. What follows is a down-to-earth experience that neither Gregor Samaran, his wife nor Gregor's friends expected...
Then it hits you: the colourful cover art is accompanied by a stunning 92 page hardback book. This is the inside of a rare *best-of* series. You'll find recipes, illustrated illustrations, a map, and a detailed map of the Col Do Ma Ma Ma Daqua -- the name is familiar.
This is what you *
*This is not how I want to remember the freckled girl from Cuno. Not how I want to remember my memory.)
You weren't *immediately* relieved, you suspected something was off, but now there's no other *way* to get out of this...
[$asteroid_sonic@bathtub_pale]],
"I could have done it, I could have run for my life!" She's much too
You are such a rubbish cop that the rest of these men have had enough fun treating you with these petty nicknames.
Say: "Five hundred Lears and I can't remember the first line! I'm sorry, but I can't remember. Please, try again. If you do, we'll exchange our passwords so that you can access the files."
"You want to protect *us*?"
A *last resort*? It's insanity on steroids, isn't it?
Thinking about drinking.
"No, look, it's Klaasje."
Alain might be lying, but he's probably not screwing around.
An entire row of tins have fallen to the floor. Plasterwork is evident in the upper left corner of the fridge.
"I'll pass." He turns the clockwise.
"No, officer."
This snowstorm is moving with tremendous violence. The piles of snow have blown away at least three snowshovels, blocking roads and burying entire neighbourhoods in darkness...
However bad it gets, don't give up. You can still achieve something here. Get *commander* -- and then some.
"I've done worse. I've *lost* my gun."
So you're not sure of what it is?
The Leader of the Wild Pines Group is glad to have met you. Perhaps you'll find out who *really* runs this place?
She's probably just making a choice.
"Yes, the one with his tie. Just like on the picture!" She pulls the cloth back to her face. The light brown eye still stands in her mouth.
"In any case, I'm done listening to your shit." (Conclude.)
How about you use the 4.20 cloned piece you found? Like we told you -- you're the one who's *lying* about the case.
This complicated book is meant for those who like to get into arguments without having to bring their grievances to a *lively* audience.
This is a pattern. A children's play. They usually see a crow, then a bat, then a fish, then a dog, then a firefly.
You've taken great pains to make sure the ultra-high frequency range is as clear and distinct a range as possible. It's the difference between a wall and a melted snow globe.
He is genuinely worried now.
Don't be an idiot. If you don't want to say it, don't. It's your decision to keep quiet about the hunch.
"So they thought, well, lets get all the working-class onto
Oh yeah. Zoom out and be consumed by the burning embers within.
He doesn't mean it in earnest. It's a cruel jest.
A joke, right? He probably thinks it's clever, though.
It's implied he doesn't trust you completely. There's a smirk on his face, a sly grin. He might be amused.
Nothing. Nothing. *Nudged it*! Sure there's nothing else to do, it's just a cop's blanket here...
"Oh my god, that's so *hard*..." she almost chokes from her own voice. "Ack, I can't believe he died like that..."
"Murderers..." She looks down. "What about me? I'm sorry I said that."
Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember the Hjelmdallermann-Kjøttberg pact. The ice bear will always protect and defend the honour of Man from Hjelmdall.
She taps on the greasy white plastic of the card. "I am sorry, officer, but I just can't do it anymore. I need to concentrate on the investigation."
He studied the figurines closely. "They're both real tough. All of them. With one exception -- the *2
A delicious tingle rushes down your spine and you feel your toes uncurl. Just a feeling. Breathe it in, you've got this.
"'She's not the sort who'd think throwing herself against a wall is something her husband would ever consider.'"
Sounds like *his* name. You may know it from somewhere else -- but you don't know where.
What's the most dangerous city in the world?
That's a very, very good question.
Looks like it could belong to the unit that transported the lieutenant and his entourage to the South Pole.
"There may be. Let's go and check it out then."
"But that's not true. It's a metaphor."
That's right. A borscht master! With sauerkraut, kraut, or brakeman. Now you both need those leg muscles of yours.
"No one in the command chain *knows* how to do this. There are thousands of people and their bosses in the whole city."
And then the party keeps going. Maybe she'll notice something. Like the severed foot? Or maybe the large-headed youth?
"Yeah, Kim, I think I have what you need. So... are we ready?"
Here you go: access to the roof, weapon, and motive. That's not too hard. And here's the thing that makes it even easier: You're still in control of your situation at this point. You can keep it in if you want to escalate.
You've convinced her.
Your fingers are trembling from the electrode, but no sign of injury. You're completely new at this.
In the mean while. Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember The Rite of Honour. It will always cleanse a man's soul...
The captain studies you silently for a moment, in silence. "I understand that your *little cop* is not here to arrest you, but I still feel there's something I can do to assist you in your investigation."
"Yes. This will cover all our arrangements and papers for the trip. I'm sure everything's going to be fine."
Is he telling the truth?
"Cool. I like pop culture stuff. Movies, characters, sports shit..."
"Actually I *don't* wanna."
Be *suspicious* now, *bratan*! Perhaps this *coincidentally* coincided with the start of the rum embargo. Just in case.
"I'm a big fan of hidden camera shows."
What did you learn from ULAN television?
The gun he's carrying is old and worn out. Like a sword, it must have been used once, maybe two decades ago.
Okay, it *is* a bit strange coming off the flow and all, but what the fuck are you gonna do about it? Try it again?
To your right, the tall man in the checkered jacket turns back to you, laughing: "Can we get back to the innossence? Can we?"
You attempt to turn the handle, but the door does not budge. You slide the panel back into place.
"Is this the last time I'm seeing you?"
The collapse of the Tien-En conflict--the two sides holding territory in the pacific rim of the Insulindian isola.
So that's what it was, before! You try to remain conscious as you stare at the invisible monster, while it eats your brain.
Though she lies low, unseen by her employees, the wind ruffles her hair as she makes her way towards the market.
The grey nomadic herders are silent, their pens empty. A trail of blood reveals itself from the mouth of the pelican, long lost.
Cuno?
Not *lightly*. The suspension of disbelief is too great.
He's right. You've been consuming alcohol for some time, sire. Before the crash you were able to drink half of it...
"Wait, Kim... who do I even know?"
"I'm just a... cop."
"I still need to know where you are. And also, where are we?"
You should have an idea of what you're dealing with here. The problem isn't Frissel the Fun, it's…
"Because they were corrupt cops who killed the king."
"The wildin' horses -- how did you see it. The white-on-blue lorry. The bullet hole in your wall? You had to cover it up... If it was a *bullet*, it would have been far away."
And the heart of a racer, too.
Of course. Whatever you do, don't say the first thing. People will see you're a slippery bastard.
Someone has put a lot of things up in the air and not just the sheets. It's like they're written right on the page. And then -- you, the reader, are left to decide what to do.
The tattoos on the man are uneven, his face shows patchy chin and jaw line. Still, he doesn't look youth. At all.
You should have the key.
"Don't interrupt." She hums with evident respect.
A slight tremble passes through the limbs, as if waking from a deep sleep. You are still surprised by this sudden sensation.
Hmm, but it's not good.
Stories have it that he had his bedroom converted into a treasure chamber where he stored unfathomable wealth: *untapped* tropical hard-covers, serialized *fantastique* serialized *romance*, dated leather jackets, and knitted scarves.
"Fine, let's say... 75%. But it's not really about the coins, is it?"
It's almost touching how dark the title is. In the dark, not in the dark -- hear me there...
Thinking of drinking.
This is a trick. When someone says they're sorry, they don't usually apologize.
It's clear that he's checking out your co-workers, especially now that you're running interference for him. You have to be careful -- not to let him down.
"A lot of people *did* like it. Gotta bring a whole bunch of shit together to make things work."
The crunching of concrete. Bodies falling into the sea by the thousands. Bones snapping. Blood gushing out.
Your hands are becoming less and less cooperative. The *tokens* are becoming more and more difficult to control -- your vital signs indicating tissue damage.
A breeze ruffles her hair as she moves across the water.
"I'm fine, kat. Let's keep moving."
A little window here? It's the movie sign, looking south -- a sign that says *You're hallucinating!* There's an entire wall devoted to the *Germaine Dei* -- *Germaine the Man».
Could it be some kind of prank call? You feel bad suddenly. Then you remember your *moral compass* and move on...
"They're *bigger* than you. Two storeys tall. You need a very strong *architectural* team to design and build these."
Boom-boom morons on a weekly basis indulging in some gross public indecency. What follows is a never-ending parade of neuroses.
Your name is *subject to* interpretation. Don't let anyone convince you differently.
Reality... (Look around.)
You *can* analyse the jigsaw pieces. The speedfreak is staring at you from across the room.
A heavy door with a slight patina... You've heard the reeds' howls, but you don't know what to say about it.
You're doing the *right* thing by not giving the cadaver a second chance to speak.
What is this? You can't even use the word "rut" on this ship! You need to talk about *THE WAR*, man.
Ignore the red thread.
He looks you dead in the eye. "You don't even know why you're here, you can't even begin to guess..."
"Didn't I already tell you? We're *in* this." He points at you. "With these guys, me and Titus..."
You *didn't* catch that one. But yeah, it was there.
Somebody has to rush in to break the siege. The Man from Hjelmdall scrambles to his feet and fires down on the boot, like some artillery piece.
The coat has been pulled tight over the body to keep it from ruffling. The boots are clean and shiny.
You feel it. The ball starts moving again. Almost as if it's not scared...
The beat of your music drowns out her sighs, like a drowning man putting his hand into a brine bath.
"Actually, I already have a copy of the paperwork. But I'm keeping it."
Yeah. Sure does look like a lot of people were in there. At least 10 at least. Maybe 15.
"Nah. The golem shit is a joke. We don't have a reason to build a golem. That's a... philosophical thing."
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see your face
He's really hurting now.
There is an old Western-styled town, built on stilts above the water. The name on the door reads *Gaston Baer*. It's a picturesque location.
Silence. The only thing you can make out is a *spinner* in the cane.
"Oh, you're asking questions. I'm a cop. I'm not surprised. People sometimes ask questions."
"Oh, right, I got that. Very weird. Are you a stalker?"
What if you're a janitor?
It *is* very important to him that you are not disturbed. Make it right...
Of course. This investigation has been superseded by an event that no longer happens in the real world -- or in
"But all this *showmanship*..."
"Okay. But there's still a problem with not opening them."
"It's Rene, officer. He's with the ICP. He's talking about some black market activities." She tilts her head. "I've seen *things*. The ICP stands for International Collaboration Police."
The phone gets hanged up fast as you take it out. The heat death scenario doesn't work in this case.
The shame is attached, but mostly because of you -- the Burnt Out Quarter Mag. Too bad you can't remember the last time you heard that.
After what must have been an indeterminate amount of time, the phasmid has grown an antlers out of his head. The snow has gotten so dark your naked eye can barely make out the scribbling.
He's having trouble adjusting to the idea that he's mostly responsible for Villette's degeneracy.
You were pretty sure she was huffing some kind of magic up there...
Say: "I told you she kept her promise. Do you remember? Remember the one time we talked like this? Remember how we talked like this? Remember how we talked like this before?"
He frowns. "No, not the *silent* one. The one you heard. Thought it was obvious... Then you heard that façade again, don't you remember? Now it's gone again, sorry."
Do it. Find her husband.
This is not a man without flaws, this is a man who has serious alcohol problems.
Some surmise it may have been the Oranjese artist Nix Gottlieb who, during Wirrâl's lifetime, created the *archipelago* -- a vast map stretching across the boarder's neck.
Can you *hear* anything?
A sigh. There's no realisation on the old man's part... maybe the *next time*? You have to work with what you have.
You don't have to. He's not going to put up with it. And if he doesn't, you *can* make him work harder.
"I'm old and tired of this question. It's getting boring now."
He does not feel guilty about it.
"Aye. I guess so." She smiles and dips her toe back into the water.
Relax. The consequence table is still there, a black rectangle waiting to be flipped...
It must have been something he saw -- sitting on those wooden benches outside, his mind working overtime to come up with a theory for why Titus isn't interested in this woman. Or maybe he wanted to impress her. Either way...
Wow. That's awesome. Well played.
Let's face it, the main thing keeping you together is keeping your head above water. Swim in the big pool.
Short's Guide to making Short's Complicated Life Less Amazing!
Under the pink morning sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
"You're right. You're right."
"Well, then we'll do it. Let's take the rest of your questions, okay? You're doing good here, detective."
Yes. This is not the Claires -- this is a *tribunal*. The tribunal is the *court system* in Revachol. The most recent cases are kept on hold for the provincial court, which only hears cases that have actually happened in Revachol.
"It's not so hot." (Wink.)
Perhaps the most *impressive* of all the species, the endangered Major Majestic cockatoo is rarely seen alive, relegated to just two sighting reports a year. But don't give up -- you can still listen in on No-Man's-Land, as they
Her brother picks it out of the trash: "He's been dead for *months* now. My brother takes it like three days to recover from the coma. Still, progress is a *thing*. We're gonna do it."
You hear the order repeated back to the lieutenant: "Pull -- Klaasje, please..." Then a while. It's unintelligible...
You feel a slight urge to sniff the air. Your nose is just above the portareel -- just the tiniest bit sticky. It's unpleasant, but you just have to it.
You feel it. The *silo* encloses you. It's cold. The camera lens focuses on the shortish frame of a bird -- its beak a strange orange.
Oh my god, it's *disco*. I'm so glad you liked it. You can always turn it off if you ever find out what club it was at.
He nods thoughtfully. "Maybe it's because his chest is most like a square jerk-off, in contrast to your liver-worm infernal."
"They're not." He stares at you, speechless. "Go check your pockets. You don't need this -- we're talking about business here."
Backed by his men. This man will not do *thing* until you've both been thoroughly discredited.
Wendy is part of the *terrestrial conglomerate* -- an alliance between nations of Mesque (the world's largest state) and Mercosur (the world's largest wildlife park), along with the remnants of the Reims administration.
The biggest... threat?
There is no memory of *that* before. Just light bends and stretches into infinity... the air islets are vast, holy cities of the divine.
"Right. My presence here does not change the fact that you are a police officer. And you cannot *manifest* my secret."
Pruning 'til the juice runs out is the most important part.
"It's called the Social Contract."
The clouds pass in the sky and in the water, the remains of the village disappear into the reeds. All is quiet on the Martinaise inlet...
We will not be thwarted, sire.
"I guess it just depends."
In my dreams.
Something cold wakes in the basement of the shack: the corpse of the deceased *arguably* smells of gas.
Feel the balls.
A change in the socio-economic circumstances would probably help your standing in the pecking order.
"Hah!" She holds her beer up to the ground, then a strange glint of light catches on her cornea.
If you deny yourself, you're not going to enjoy the experience. You will feel empty and unsatisfied.
His eyes were baby blue.
"Just act like a regular person."
"... for him," he repeats, aghast.
You caught him off-guard. Push him now. He's *afraid*.
It's not possible to truly empathize with an outsider.
Think again. You've probably had *at least* three minutes of interrogation. Nothing comes up. You're like a mad man.
"Been you guys, asking for *fucking*!" he yells. "You fucking dumb fuck! She fucking kidnapped the kids and now you're fucking her in the bush? Then she doesn't care if you're a cop, she cares about your *life*. You can't afford to get off this shit-slick."
I'll never be a Tequila Sunset.
Too late! The catch is already here! The phasmid has the ears of a falcon, it's crest rises to greet you...
She sounds almost childlike, yet vulnerable in her vulnerability. A whisper away, you can hear it in her voice.
I'm talking to you, bowl of fluff. Talking to *You* is the most important thing.
"Yeah, Ruby's been nice enough, but..." She doesn't look up from the keyboard. "You're the most dangerous criminal we've ever seen."
He's just trying to sound clever.
He nods. "I understand the importance of the case, officer. I'll talk to the others. Be
"I'm looking for a really good drum kit. Do you know any?"
Your words echo in the karaoke mic. They sound sparse, like a sparse-cabined cheerleading squad. No drum roll...
"Because there's nobody else to do it."
She wears a ring-like necklace around her neck, her hair is dyed blonde. As she moves her hand, the light from
Some people believe she's somehow connected to the Greys, even if they don't say so in their native tongue. That sounds a bit like the Case Closed thing to say. Interesting. You feeling?
This is an ensemble piece.
This is not going well. You've only just confessed to it. You're just gonna have to tell the story to him now...
Listen to her.
When you say she's staying put you don't mean she's staying put. The keepers have minds their own size.
"I don't think
No. You're spinning tapes at the discotheque, dancing with the girl at the disco, then forgetting to mention it...
He points to the back corner of the room. "And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois. I'm afraid Harry doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice."
An aluminum block runs the width of the board, biting down on the paperwork. Its crocodile teeth are the only thing keeping the papers together. The type: "Revachol Special Administrative Region."
In addition to the worker and building tokens used by each player, there are also several piles of colorful resource tokens, each representing one of the game's three distinct continents.
"You said you would..."
So she's not? This is bad.
Looks like there's a good spot to settle into once more. Better even than lying on the cold stone slab.
Hopes were up for him.
You don't even have a face, you're too broke for that.
"Tell me what's up with that bottle."
A *little*. Just a little bit. You swallow it all. And when you think you're done, you think the most bizarre thing in the world still *ran*!
Looking up she sees a grown man -- on the wrong side of forty, his face bloated from alcohol and maybe something else -- not so quietly crying.
While the woman ponders, two passing motorists pass by, both of them sighing in the opposite direction. One of them notices your interest and suggests you look closer.
Reed-like tufts stick out of its joints. As the limb moves its forearms: grippers for grippers. A great struggle roils
You need to fight on the streets of Revachol, where the soldiers of *year* are still basking in the golden rays of disco.
"You're right. It's not easy. But I'm trying to do my best."
Another term you don't understand... Like: "What, you don't need a *sir*?"
You'll get it. The fuck do you need against the world?
"The General Dilemma" (anodic music).
You could say he moved his hand to focus on something in the distance, then his finger moved away from it...
"I just don't like the
The wind ruffles her hair as you walk by her, but behind the woman a large concrete structure is silently shadowing you -- *her* house.
A post mortem examination of Revachol's best-loved fugitives. For years the book has been burned into your mind, an unopened can still smells of vanilla and ginger. Does the lieutenant really need it?
Finally, our bold detective is through with the main case. A sad sad case.
"Oh, I know, Harry. It's like the Revolution didn't happen. Or
"And the Revolutionary Assaulter?"
The *distress call* you picked up.
This makes *interesting* reading. The telecommunication square is made up of rectangles, sticks and leaves. What could go wrong?
Trying to gauge by your expression and demeanour how sincere the woman truly is. You seem very silly for suggesting this conversation -- if at all.
It's getting dark and the wind is coming... The antechamber is about to fall into the abyss.
Yes, *bratan* -- your pathetic identity, your *bratan*! Forget about the rest. This is too important to be left unfinished. You need to complete this.
No. You're spinning tapes at the discotheque. It's late. There's a constant hum. And not a lot of dancing either.
"Oh, he can't be. My memory is good." The lieutenant tries to reason. It is hard to concentrate on something else.
"Look, it's Arno van Eyck! Just answer some questions!"
"I wouldn't put it past the Wild Pines rep for their payment processing systems. But if the bag is indeed the one you were given -- then I would suggest paying for it up front."
*snort*
These are some of the recognitions the late addition has made. A total of twelve. Seven of those are in the order of a hundred.
I'm sorry you had to deal with it. I'm sure there's plenty of other things to do... Besides playing...
An evil cog in a neat little box.
"Huh, like what exactly?"
"There's a dead body on the boardwalk."
Nothing to do with this one, *bratan*. Maybe try something else?
"Good to hear that you're doing good. Can I help you with anything, like a teacher would, ma'am?"
You should've guessed. Maybe it's your imagination, but you just can't *
The kid's not even looking at you, he's snooping somewhere in the cup. You should go on, try harder, closer to the wound...
"You know, Officer, you might be thinking -- we haven't even met the company rep yet! We could ask her where she is or get her to cooperate with us. We could even take her in for questioning yourself -- once we get back!"
"It's a prime real estate opportunity. Good times." He shakes his head. "It'll only yield real estate for people who want to stay here."
A bit odd, isn't it, thinking about the colour of her skin and hair and all of her exotic destinations? Why such a forward-looking blazer, if it's not like that?
You... you're just a shadow for him, an abstraction to be manipulated. He needs someone to gush through clenched jaw.
There really *is* no need to push your luck. You're about to pull a really cool bluff here. Pretend you're not interested in the theory.
Feel the zip.
...he's done enough.
Have you tried... goading him?
Suddenly the beating heart of a thousand paper cuts is pumping through your veins -- you're in, baby, you're in. In your belly-in-the-fish bowl, between your teeth. On the silver-blue water
There's
He doesn't actually think it's all that extraordinary.
He thinks for a moment, then shrugs. "She's with us. That's the way she is. We can talk about the weird weather at home, if you want."
A wooden plaque on the wall reads: "Remains of a defunct research and development company, still standing. No one used to do anything here."
This is a great platform for a warm-up. Play with it!
The *Reservoir Bull* was once a product of the *Wild Pines* region. Possessed by a resident named Miss Beaufort. Like all bull telegraph poles, it will always rum in the headlines.
He means the game's creator.
From the ashes -- the remains of a fire destroyed the old government headquarters, Tower H, used as a command post for Royal Decombers, a...
"Ahem. Cuno's hiding a dead body here
Let's *try* to get in. (Finger pop.)
"Good, thank you, officer! Was there anything else? Or... is that it? I think we've arrived at the conclusion, officer?"
What if I told you... it is perched on the end of a huge *stick*, watching you through the mist and the rain?
Don't forget, it's part of the afterlife too... just staring at the wall will make you forget everything...
The world is gone. You've truly given up on trying to connect the dots.
"Okay, so if you want to take us back to what happened here, then we need to go back to Jamrock and reach for
He shakes his head in regret. "Oh no... I don't mean to be *reckless* -- at least not right now. Try
"I knew it! I knew he was gay! I knew his work! In a word -- SAX."
"I have my reasons."
"No..." She almost says something. "I'm just gonna wait here, thanks."
The cool with him. That's her number one killer.
The barbell lies on the floor like a boa constrictor, half-submerged in water. An empty cigarette butt remains between your shoulder blades.
"Hm. That's not *enough*?"
She wants to resist, but her spirit is weak, and she is off-key.
If it's possible, then by pure willpower alone. You can't ask someone to do something they don't want to do.
The commotion has died down. No one is staring in silence. She moves like a lively swarm of bees, unaware of its presence.
As you gaze upon the rough stone of the bench, the plaza around you still covered with the bloodstains of war -- you wish you could sit and alleviate the pain of your flesh.
Go ahead, do it -- you want to be a cybernetician? Cyberneticians use computers. Go to the library card under the picture of Frittte. You got it.
As he shifts uncomfortably, a series of clicks, like a clapper on a regular keyboard. You're back in the terminal.
"What if I was to find you a book, detective? Some darlings of mine, no doubt. And would you be willing to put in the long hours with the company-employed janitor?"
"I *got this one!*" (Show him the tape)
This is so doable. Say it.
The family home... the couple already moved in. You could ask around, but why would you want to open that door?
The operator's assistant says to press *PRINT* once more.
But I *know* it was against the law for her to look the other way.
He looks around -- then at you. "I wasn't sure about the other stuff -- I should have gone with the gun. Stuff gets scary if you keep it behind the counter."
When you stroll off into the great unknown that is the Strait of Messina, you might be forgiven for thinking you lost it...
*slurp*," "Fuck you, old man." He turns to you. "Did you still try to give it to me? After you *renowned* it?"
The pace you're getting here is off. You should slow down. The more you do, the more uncomfortable it
As
Look, there's *more* than just one in there. Look at the others. Look at them from the corner of your eye and then...
Do you? You betcha. Question is, will you be *honoured* tonight? The details are fuzzy, there's a war story to be told...
"You can't just take over the world."
For a moment, his breathing is imperceptibly heavier. Then he clears his throat, and the strange feeling passes.
She gives you a curious look. It's like your brain switches places -- to the right, to the left.
"I'm afraid you haven't told me all you know, dear. You may
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this moment of hesitation, is it better to let him get on *his* about things? It's MURDER AT THE HOOKAH PARLOUR!
Hey, hey, hey, you did it! You got the *traps* and now he's talking...
The lieutenant makes little comments.
The big guy gives you a very slight nudge his side, asking: "What happened to your knee, cop?"
He is surprisingly nonchalant about this. Could it be that he somehow knows more about your condition than he's letting on?
And the identity of the elusive *Other Guy*.
The grasslands appear lifeless, as though you were still standing there. Nothing but black branches seem to have moved from thine own footprints.
Maybe there's a *another* way to wake up...
Yeah, this is *very* weird.
You've identified a handful of metabolites, all of which can be broken down into basic Lewisian oxides.
You're going to make this guy look bad. At least have some decency. At the very least, tell the story straight.
You can't shake her down for this. It's not worth the hassle.
You gaze at the shadow-obscured figures tangled in the netting around the corpse. Somehow they always seem to end up at
Sure, and it's not like we *can* stop it? Don't take our guns, commit crimes... crimes cause other people to feel uncomfortable.
"Wow, Kim, you've got a problem with all kinds of things? Even *feral* dogs. How do you keep it together?"
You feel the urge -- when your partner leaves and you get the urge again. But you are too sad to cry out loud, too busy to cry out...
On the platform a young woman is withdrawing from amphetamines and alcohol. She sees a foamy substance ahead -- and feels it.
It *does* look *bad*. The all-too-familiar looking fuel oil seems almost lifelike, like the kind of thing a grown man would be proud to rock himself to. But, just as a grown man would, he pulls the plug.
"What is the Revolution?"
I'm sorry you had to destroy that window, he thinks. But you couldn't make out the details, so why is he sulking?
He feels really bad about it. About his eyes mostly -- probably because he doesn't know what those eyes look like, either.
So who's really in charge here?
Don't give him the hint. He's still thinking about his ledger. *He* is mentally tough out there -- plus, he's *not* going to make it without you.
Hesitates for a moment or two, then speaks straight after: "Ruby's here. So is Dick Mullen. I hope we can get this case solved."
He laughs. "I ain't gonna start *no more* no more rumors than I need to hear. Not now, man. Don't worry about it."
"Right, I think I can see that now."
A shabby door hangs oddly on the wall, secured to the frame with wood glue. There's an unidentifiable substance underneath.
The lieutenant gives you a wink. "Looks like you got him to talk to you."
She's clearly doing the maths here. She'll only negotiate if she has to.
"You don't like that Cuno?" He sounds impatient. "You go home then. Cuno ain't fucking babysitting that old shit in here. Cuno's not gonna sit on the bench like you."
The girl... the girl upstairs?! There's no other way to get such an incredible, hypnotizing feeling...
The frozen man lets out a few short blasts of frozen breath, then seems to take a step back, his features relaxed.
Yes, the needle in the haystack. The only 'sane' about this investigation is that it's not really an investigation at all. It's a *harmless indulgence*.
"The Devil's in the bedroom!" he yells from upstairs. "The fuck are you fucking doing in his room?! He's locked upstairs! Free-ass S-P-E-R
He is thinking of you -- and what you could mean to him in your life.
She *knows* you're referring to the deceased, don't you? He could've sworn he saw your face beneath the tall order form.
Her husband drowned in World War II. Her brother was given the same treatment -- but served longer. This is the other brother.
Mhm. I know it's hard to concentrate on deep thoughts, but think of the strangest thing you've ever heard.
"Okay, but how did you know what it did? What evidence do you have?"
Everyone is sitting on the internet and waiting for a guy named "Kim " JV%" to show up on the crime scene. Who is this Kim "JV%" and what does he want?
The light vanishes inside the concrete slit. The structure does not follow your gaze -- it's leaving your form behind. Feels like a thousand tiny blinks, all within a single frame.
As he shifts uncomfortably the lieutenant notices something moving in the background: a small radio-like thing, blinking at you from the distance...
Mazov is famous for his superlatives!
There it is! It's as if you saw a ghost in his sleep. Slow dying -- a ghost of old age, slowly...
All those empty wine bottles and cigarette butts... oh no, so many of them. So many bundles of clothes -- each one heavier than the last.
Seriously though, what's the problem?
"I think what happened is -- Kras Mazov got into a debate with Reinhold Niebl. Some arguement, some words, in the lead up to the war. Mazov: Green armies. Nein. The fates have spoken."
It's the >Orwell brothers</br><br><i>René</i>, an alcoholic running around Skellig Michael. The >René of old...
"So, the bodies haven't been collected yet. Should we start digging around, please?"
This is also a route that used to be impassable, but then a landslide occured, and a pair of eternite washers were installed to make it easier to cross the canal.
This is another in a long line of attacks against the commonweaver. The last, and longest in a series of assaults against the city of Revachol, was the massive camp-fires that blanketed much of Martinaise in the winter of '37-'38.
Put the headless FALN rider's skull ornament in the bottle.
"I'm just a gardener. I'm not supposed to be doing this."
Yes. They are small but subtle expressions of affection. Over time the viewer is
With a loud thud the door opens -- and in walks a very excited-looking lieutenantly man. You've never seen him work
The little brave birch-tree seems to wave back in the wind.
If anything, your mind tells you otherwise. You should always *proceed* with a plan, even when it doesn't work out.
She seems to like the idea of you being a cop. It may be the only *reason* she has for locking herself away in this closet.
A soft gust of air passes through the trees. The air inlet it has just been washed away.
He turns to you. "Gimme a lift, man. You work harder than *anyone*!"
Of course. Someone has to rush in to fill in when Cuno goes. Who's that mysterious man standing right next to you in the window?
It'll come off like you're fading -- into the sunset, he thinks. But you're not, and he doesn't *feel* dangerous. He's silent.
All things considered -- very. Now, can we really be sure the door is secure? It's *not* the door. Oh, it's the *Iron Curtain*! The door must be on the other side of the door...
She looks devastated. Her young life partner is right behind her -- at least her balding is fixed.
That's what he was called. You'll find out who's who in the next panel.
"Not *particular* because of them. What do you want, officer?" She shakes her head.
"You don't live here, you don't understand. Just like everyone else. You're crazy."
Stay calm. Just in case.
Once more you look to the sea, the cold water of the Martinaise Inlet, against the shadow of Klaasje's - *staying* put out.
It takes a while, but you and the lieutenant manage to put everything more or less where it was...
It's painful to even think about, let alone conjure up a picture of a sword. Even more distressing is the thought that your mind-controlled hand is incapable of understanding...
Sounds like he wants things to get worse before they get better. This may be a temporary spike, but...
"It *is* possible."
All human beings have those three things missing -- they're missing their inside linebacker. The *inside linebacker* is the glue that holds the front and back halves of your brains together.
Lingo it up.
Shelves full of romance stories, movies and television shows filled with women in skimpy clothes and skimpy underwear.
Maybe if you were to stand in just the right spot, even your footsteps would be completely silent...
The colonel shakes his head in disapproval. "I doubt it. But it's a brave tenement and all that."
No. It's too late. You've been dead for four days -- how is that possible? Five, maybe six weeks? The patient never stops convulsing, the behind-the-woman's-back behavior is as it always is. She'll re-emerge on the scene, only a little worse for wear.
Did you hear that -- a click? A whisper? There is a dog barking at you from the distance, its throaty howl calling out to you from the dilapidated old stave.
The memory of the kill moves fast. In a blur of sound -- the lieutenant steps in.
Thank you, yes. Thank you. I'll do my best to support it. *Other* animals too, I mean. Chess pieces, small ones at least.
You have little idea what the hell you're doing here, but if you can't trust your own eyes, maybe it's best to just proceed.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, pain shoots up your left side again. You're alive. Just take it easy -- keep it together.
The alarm rings, woke from a thousand years of sleep.
Saw her at the gates.
The player spins the Bernard shell again and with the help of the other Tequila Works employees he begins to construct a
I don't know... this pessimism is driving us mad. We're in over our heads.
"Maddening... I like you, little guy, but I'm just not sure how you got me into this mess in the first place."
"A date with ... Tio Löw?"
Your mouth
Mhm, cool drug. You'd love it. For the cold, hard serotonin -- and the ephemeral heartbreak it brings.
This one is particularly prone to erratic hand gestures -- but mostly because he trusts no one. Needs constant supervision, sure,
Your fist connects to the data port and feels the plastic -- it's the first impression you get
I'm trying to help you...
It's like you can feel it growing in the air around you, as though someone *placed* the coloured glasses on you.
"Good, *deceitful* of you to ask such a thing," the lieutenant takes off his glasses and applies them to the window. "I'm not a naked perso-tan!"
"In this room? There are cops. They're *connected*. This is her life or death."
"I've wanted to talk about this more, but I was afraid of being suspected of something corrupt."
"How much did he tell you about the gloves?"
A phrase of the king. A wannabe-king. Whatever you do, don't lean on the old leg too heavily.
"I'm gonna need your help with something. Right now, I can only give you one... maybe two..."
And your front teeth too! You've been munching on your lip balm all morning! By the time you've finished chewing, your gums are red with tooth
"Wait, so..." He looks at you and makes sure you understand. "It's... not my usual *wanders* you'd get here..."
That's weird. Punk rock and hardcore music in particular are pretty mysterious.
Is it? The order was *immediately* executed.
"What did they do?"
I don't know, man, it's all a bit odd.
Your electric distribution board has received a significant overhaul. A core of *power*, braced for impact.
The wall towers in the distance, making it difficult to discern a single person's presence. However, the distant volume makes it abundantly clear that there is someone in the room.
Maybe if she's *not* on drugs?
That's it -- death is like that. You hear the droning of the rain, the clinking of glass as it pours onto the wooden planks.
They would have a good view of the tracks in the mud from the second floor of the Whirling-in-Rags.
That's all she has to say on the subject. She *will* do anything, including break the cardinal rule of the thumb -- don't ask permission before doing something.
The old man raises a beer can in your direction and says: "Come on, show him what you got, pig!"
"Even *I* can see that." She looks at you with some sadness in her eyes. "My love for it is what attracted me to you, Harry, not you about it. Now, I mustn't talk about it any more..."
Another shudder pulses through the creatures limbs. It jolts back to life, like a record continuing were it left off -- in a swaying, praying motion. Even the small black pearls of its eyes do not stray from you...
"She could have."
"The man with sunglasses -- he doesn't really have a name."
Before you is a meadow of corpses, smoking and dying -- all under the watchful gaze of a black sky.
That he's finally come up with a good reason for his stubbornness -- something besides violence -- makes it almost poetic in its intensity.
As your rage burns within your chest, you say the words again. Half of them are true -- and the other, *a bit* true.
"Wait -- how did you learn my name?"
"Do you know the guy who made this place? On Boogie Street?"
Wait, is he saying *I told you so*? You're going to be hearing things from him for quite a while.
The woman looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you. She's not particularly interested in talking about the cryptids right now.
Where the music takes place -- you'll never know. There is no music here. You are lost.
The most horrific of all the *destructive* impulses. Tire a groove into it. Break it free from its stupor.
They could have just left the broken flak tower off.
Maybe it's some club for fixing up. Don't forget your hat, it's important to your performance here.
You're not! It's like there's an emotional stake here. She's talking about a political ambition. Like there's a *scab*.
The desk is big enough for you to fit two people inside. On a bed, on a sheet of cold water, in the hammby-rich south-east corner of the building.
A pair of mountain bike wheels squeak in the yard under the watchful eye of the police officer.
"The insignia of Securitate -- but you're a cipher!"
Odd. Over the course of the two hours you have been here has there been one time when the lieutenant has not been present?
"A symbol of national unity?"
What was *that*? A typo? You conflate the *relief* with the *phantom* -- the *bad news*.
"Fine. I'm not a person of *thespianic principles*."
With an ominous, but kind of *normal* ring, the lieutenant draws a line in the air. Then looks at you.
"They've been so *helpful* we're here. Please, feel free to ask anything."
"I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of ghosts."
The girl in the yard, looking at you with tender, sad eyes.
The *original dual-copotype*. The number on the back reads: "Royal Palm Fibre".
Her reticence is deafening. "Sure. It's... okay. But..." she says, as if it's an unwritten rule in this White House.
The gauge stands still, his expression unchanged.
Oh yeah. So be careful. Also, you should show everyone exactly what you got for free. You know, everyone appreciates a honest cop.
The suitcase does not *have* any bags! You can't possibly open its *big brother*. You will return empty-handed and just leave it lying there...
"Goddamnit, Titus!" He has an abrupt look on his face. "I'm going to cut your fucking head off."
Under the winter sky the great district hums in the wind: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron. From Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
"I did -- I mean after we got the body
Waver... Why does it feel like you're *losing* control of the bike?
"I don't wanna talk about that police matter."
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what's really wrong with you? After you've said everything else?
The wind changes direction again, and so do you. Somewhere in the East, the principal locusts are packing up. Moving eastward. As dusk falls on the Cassel Street bridge -- where dusk has fallen for three-quarters of a century.
She's quiet for a second... before she speaks again: "It's a misnomer to think the Union boss is scared of us.
Yes, all the way back in the harbour, chattering in the streets and boisterous celebrations on the stage -- even the life-supporting vocals of the Revacholian soul...
You could try to explain your position to the lieutenant in more detail. He could give you a call.
She nods, then adds, in a gravelly voice. "I'm sorry my brave reserves are at risk again. If you guys could just get this *thing*... I'm sure it would make all the difference."
"Thank you for your advice, officer."
"It's quite all right. The drop is quite... disappointing."
Your heart beats again, an echo of the beat, a feel of fresh air on the lips of the tree-dwellers.
Your tongue is still lolling in the bowl, unpleasantly so. You wish you could just spit it out...
A vehicle shaped like the King of Prussia, north of here. Hot air bubbles rise from its white crown.
The decision is yours, your weight has always been your *biggest* problem.
The index in the bottom right corner of the screen is still cluttered with cases solved by investigators from across the Station.
A catatonic woman under the age of 52 years. Where *is* the world? There must be a place to put this catatonic shit.
Take a calm head look at that wretched list of things you're forgetting about. I'll give it back to you. You don't need it any more."
"Yeah, I can see that. What else did you wanna know?"
To your right, the captain keeps his eyes on the door. It's barred from the inside.
"I think you meant it to be funny."
The wall towers in the distance, reminding you of the war torn walls and ceilings of the world.
A team of two. Two people stand in front of a huge pile of supplies and other resources: a rare black night is coming, resources are running out...
Oh, no. It *has* been too long. Don't listen to her, this has got to be one of the strangest coincidences you've ever seen. Don't fall
It's pretty clear these objects were used in some way or another by the person standing in the corner opposite you.
Even though you're an asshole who got into this, you think you got a really, really good deal there. You should sue him back.
"Forget it, was it just some armour?"
Looks like the bird was ripped off the shield that was used to mount it -- most likely on a wall. The panel was left exposed when the loader got stuck.
No. They won't be there. They're too busy smoking weed and thinking about basketball. Leslie will get them anyway.
No, that's not it. You're still in control. You can go on like this for a week or so, just to see what it comes
You're *not* afraid. This isn't paranoia. This isn't hyperbole. It's plain old *STOP TRANSMISSION*.
"I'm a cop. I will do what I can."
Gone are the days when men played with dolls and rode on horses to the seaside lagoon where balls were lodged; long live the *Palais René*!
The folder slides into the inaccessible place in the basement. It is not labeled *yet*. It is not *locked*.
One can't help but notice a suspicious detail in the deep fried restaurant's signage. It suggests the *god particle* has abandoned it...
Under the night sky the great district sleeps: A chessboard of old wooden houses in the snow, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to
"It's a nightmare. A nightmare of fear, responsibility, and broken dreams."
How about you stop talking about the damn tape? You know what this man would love, though -- more than anything...
Get a hold of yourself -- this is another *riddle*. Guess you can't really be an epidermochromatic riot...
Even if you could somehow get the lieutenant to be more honest with you, there would be no photos to be embarrassed of.
He doesn't mean it in earnest. The way he says it, it's not.
"I don't know, I'm just saying that I don't really do questions
She really doesn't remember. If she really thinks this much as a tourist, then she must have been in a hurry to tell him...
No, that's not it. You're gonna be *recharged* from this cold supply chain down the river, some kind of *purge* is inevitable.
"Yes, what you want to know is, how many abs have you had?"
You may be holding the melody track... too much power to give up. You'll never hear the words sung, but you can feel them radiate. Like the sweet scent of alcohol rising from your lips.
"I want a cuppa, big boy."
The reeds whisper a around the sepulchral trap, as though it were the least interesting thing in the world.
This one's bad. Constantly looking over your shoulder is not good enough. Get the fuck outta here!
He is dead serious about this.
The man leaves like a burnt roast chicken. The feeling from the corpse is much stronger. He's been saying the seditious things for a while now.
He frowns. "Anyway... he said he had a gun and that he would use it against the Union."
A *crazy* wood?
I'm actually surprised he didn't hang up before he said those things, you thinking, not the lieutenant.
It's going to be pure enough to focus on anything that's wrong with the world.
You cannot but notice the mention of a trap leads to a few seconds of silence before the rabbit declutters its lines.
You have an explanation for all this. Somewhere deep in you -- you just don't have the pieces yet.
"I don't know, pig. I'm pretty sure you're an epidermochromatic skunk."
Looks like it could belong to the same sewer system as *La Delta*, where the bottle is hidden.
"What do you know, Kim? Do you know anything about my gun? I need to talk to you about my gun!"
For some reason, you find it difficult to believe that a 20-something man with a precarious, uneven upper lip and a goatee could look so... well, human.
The woman gives birth to a son, a little under nine months old. He doesn't speak. The sky is indifferent to his silence.
"That would be a tragedy."
"Okay, what's the name?"
He's not.
This is some insane shit. You need help now.
Her skin is an oily blend of carrageenan and guaran. Your fingers find themselves coated in it, over the centuries.
So far no one has even noticed the wee
RIGHT NOW MOTHERFUCKER!
"I do -- I'm one of them. But if it's not the Late Revolution then I'm just a petty criminal."
"I'm looking for a fake driver."
"The last thing I remember before going to sleep is you yelling at me, 'She's not my real name.
There is very little there. There's a *tiny* bit of text, written in capital letters: "WATCH OUT." *Don't* let it stand -- knock on *The Bair Tower*!
"The *brand* is very much associated with manual scavenging in Hammerklippr," he explains.
He doesn't have to be drawn on this. It's a stupid expression.
"Why do you keep talking about it?"
"At any rate, let's talk about the shoes..."
For a moment you cease to read the papers on the coffee table. The pull-out toolbox slides back into its nest.
He is afraid of heights.
"Oh my god, okay, this is... (paint a sick face) okay, but where did you get this glinting box?"
"These dial keys do indeed look old, but the old lead is long gone. What *you* have is the key that
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror at the fourth, a middle-aged man with bloated cheeks, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
She already is! With these beauties you're practically a detective.
There's more to this. She has an index in her head of pathologies and how to exploit them. You can almost see her turn the pages.
"Here's your new bill, ma'am." (Give him the document.)
*A-ha*! Yes! You should read more. *More* about *reality*.
"Yes. I'm probably wasting my time here
And the woman?
I understand -- the FALN gear comes standard with a 12-barrelled sub-machine gun. That's right, you can carry it in your hand.
She waves her hand between you and the wind. "Can't say I'm a huge admirer. But, yeah... there's something there."
There it is, another behind-the-scenes look into the R&D labs. Look at the figurines -- you *know* it's the right hand man for the job.
For a moment, the old man is silent. Then he speaks. "The theory is sound, really. Maybe we were wrong about the dead man staring at you."
"What happened to me? I've been telling you all this, but I can't seem to find my gun..."
The place does not look administrative, do we really?
It's like he wants you to *share* his hatred of the world, it's no wonder he behaves like that.
Another sorry.
A desperate struggle for air starts inside your lungs.
*coughs violently*
"That's not... who I am, sire."
The pole has been carefully cut, the wood grain is chipped, and the paint has stripped off the bottom half. It's a good call -- you got it.
An innocence so precious it's beyond redemption... for what?
"Really, officer? Please say nothing and let me work."
"Don't..." The lieutenant is about to say something, but turns away to inspect the corpse.
He winks at you, strangely quiet and distant -- these are the last of the last of his kind.
He doesn't seem to be overly glad you didn't hand him out to the British.
It is extremely unlikely that any of this is what happened to the colossus that ate your heart.
"Funny," she nods. "The researcher who came up with that crazy ray. Turns out they were all..." She stops. "Alain -- Evrart."
As he concludes your little roundtable discussion, Jim turns to you. "If you're going to share an apartment with her, why don't you come back and ask the one that lives there if you see something interesting."
Salty milk and molasses. These are not part of the Old World, she says. They are parts of *the World*.
The man nods to you, then at the corpse again, as if he's done it before. You're left with the scent of
This was the officer who escorted you to Precinct 41, onto the streets of Revachol. You should've known -- he was feeling *tempered*.
Listen within the place of industry, where power and structure join perfectly… I probe...
She's stressed. She's got work to do.
There is no awakening -- only wailing.
"Okay, I'm paying you."
Crawl in.
He nods. "He speaks fast and precise. I've spoken with no one else -- and that's how we found out her real name."
"I should take this seriously." He steps away from the lens. "But it's not. I'm not a police officer."
Hear that, asshole? You were about to take the world's dirtiest drug denier by force -- this was a mistake. ABORT!
There it is again! You see the ghostly actresses and the rusty toolbox under the seat... You even spot a rare 'T' under the driver's seat...
Not you. I'm not your OCR-agent.
"What do you think?" He puts his hand on his chin and
Nothing is *impossible*.
You have to stay. Even if you ratted out the room you've just been in, it would *kill* you to open your eyes and see all of this. Especially after what's on offer here.
And then suddenly you see it: the lieutenant stands there with his mouth agape -- in front of the woman who had been berating you.
"Huh, okay. Okay."
Oh god, it's Col Do Ma Ma Ma. *You* got him on your crime scene.
Tension mounts as the elder man makes his way to the fourth floor. On the roof there's a nest of some sort...
"It wasn't me, it was your heart that caused the jam to break. It's a fact."
She examines the covers, trying to gauge the inner workings of the manuscript. She's not satisfied with the current state of things.
This is quite plausible. A good sniper would aim for vulnerable areas with a well-crafted shot.
No. It's a feeling.
He smiles. "For the greater good. Regardless, we have to take him back. At some point someone has to start taking responsibility for his actions."
The lieutenant frowns. "Perhaps you could indulge in another cup of this rather than confronting Kim?"
Despite the slide, the dial slides under the magnet and out through the hole. Looks solid. Now you just need the light bulb...
"Mum says not to buy things with money. Shopping is such a stress."
Nothing happens. The old man watches you fiddle with your tie as you stare at the empty streetlight.
No one can hear you complain about the phone at this moment, because you are in silence.
The pile of papers just outside the *kitchen* is *so* big. You're tempted to take it back.
"It can't be a great burden, and yet I can't help but feel that a bit of everything..." He looks across the water. "A great burden?"
It's about the karaoke singer, isn't it? The leer that divides the sailors into two hostile camps. And then there's the hammer...
A place to teach them about the hard stuff.
Of course, not everything is 100% clear here but when is it ever? Congratulations, kids. You did the math on this one.
There's something in you -- a little. Hidden. Still you press the question.
And a bit of self-pity, too. For a man who's spent his whole life staring at the spectacles and worrying about peepholes.
"What was that about Frittte?"
The great district hums in the falling rain: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the rainswept horizon...
Maybe you should get a hair sample from here? Get that *gigantic* nose out of him, *cheek to toe*!
Don't flatter yourself -- he's not looking for your *belief* in this. He's looking for someone *badass*...
There is little you can do to assist him, actually. Your *body* is a living history -- keep it moving.
He's sorry for you.
Titus and the boys are waiting, silently. Behind the wood the red and blue reeds are growing restless.
An absurdist take on the Armistice fatality.
"Can't say. Never seen him play. Jived too hard. I've done my fair share of drugs."
The lieutenant sounds worried. He looks to the door with his glasses full of *dirt*.
Strips of polymer fabric and human tissue separate from the lining of the boots. They float to the bubbling surface.
He's got such an attitude about this, it's almost laughable.
The elder fisherman doesn't reply, but his expression is grim.
He sighs. "I understand that. The net is over two kilometres across the water and I haven't even thought about the roof... Because it's too dangerous. And because I don't have any of the *cool* drugs."
"My curiosity piqued
The ice squeaks beneath the prybar. You scrape the brash metal to get it open.
"Good morning, Metalhead."
The rocks on the coast look fractured, and older sedimentary layers piled one on top of the other. An endless variety of little
"Ominous, but not totally unexpected. The borscht is an ancient and powerful healing ritual -- part of the pantheon, you see. It's heavily regulated."
You're bad at this. The documents are all written -- almost romanized -- and all you can do is give orders as they come.
You think this might be a *little* creepy, you think this might be *unsettling*. But don't say that. It would only make him angrier.
"A little warning, then."
He gives you a long, slow shake of his head. "Fuck it -- go forth and commit even more *crimes*. Even better. Don't worry, smart one. We'll get it together."
"I can't possibly have enough of those, my hero." He sighs. "You may go. Now..."
The beefy man mimes blowing his brains out. You get the sense he's actually admiring the laptop -- and not being able to help it.
The key stops mid-way in the lock. Something's blocking it's path. You hear a dish breaking...
There is a button right behind her on the instrument, just out of reach... it must be the one that opens the door to the harbour...
He smiles broadly.
Already did that. Now your hand is covered in rust and watermarks.
"Anyway... I'm glad it's not too hard on you." She glares at you. "But I'm not here to make your life any easier."
The lieutenant purses his lips. He's slightly embarrassed to admit he doesn't really know what to say.
A guy who hangs out in a church basement? Where *are* they getting the rum and lemonade? And who exactly are they?
Ignore the feeling.
She thinks about it, then downplays the excitement: "I'm not sure we could use a *taxation officer* in this case."
She smiles a slightly amused smile, the blue eyes twinkling in the warm August sun. "Hey, don't tell the lieutenant you masturbated!"
In the bottom right corner of the screen there's a PYRO button! It gives +1 to PSYCHE skills: Empathy, Suggestion, Authority, Inland Empire, Esprit de Corps, Volition. This is good before a White Check -- but damages Health.
"You're welcome. I'm not sorry for thinking of you as
The woman looks at you with wonder and says to her son, simply: "Good to see you too. How's your back?"
"Aye. You're a lucky man. I'm not going to lie about it." She looks up, smiling. "Always a thrill ride."
"And then..." She looks around, suddenly very happy to see you. "I woke up, in a fugue state. From a day of madness. To find you."
"We won't *beat* her. We'll use force. And we will hunt her down. Every avenue we think of, we search. For clues. So what if it leads to your station, does it not?"
"Good idea. You're drunk."
"No. Stop drinking, Mr. Dros."
It's clear the lieutenant enjoys himself while this man helplessly rot in the basement.
The beast that is Klaasje has disappeared into its claw-like jaws. To your left, the phasmid moves its great bulk in silence.
The lieutenant just shakes his head.
Uh huh, *really* surprised? You got his attention and now he's annoyed with you. Guess you're in the business of pleasing *one* person?
"Does it have anything to do with the stupid pyramid you see?"
Another layer of extreme coldness.
Because I can.
His reaction is immediate. His eyes bulge with terror.
She reads them -- over again -- and throws them in different directions.
He sounds almost sad, like he's thinking of leaving. Or... he's not leaving because he's miserable, but because he's sad.
(Pinch her cheek.) "Yeah, that's me."
The man before you is cold and dead, a strange melange of flesh and sinew. What happened to make him human?
The Man from Hjelmdall stands before two rune-cast iron helmets, one from each side. Their angular shapes are formed from the combined weight of the Man from Hjelmdall and his gryffin-friend.
Again you close your eyes and again your fingers move on the rotary dial. Ten metallic rings as the dial returns to zero after each number.
Isn't it weird when all this stuff is tied up in the past and you have to force it to come back to the present?
Your jaw drops like a popcorn monster. You're too proud to say that now, but *somehow* you think you can come up with a few vague outlines.
Kim finds your attitude... peculiar.
It's a let down. If he doesn't stop immediately, you may be forgiven for thinking he's just a b.s.
No wonder.
If you can't trust your own eyes, who can you trust? Certainly not Kim.
With a *plop* sound, a tear of raw emotion runs down the throat of Cuno, then his parting shot rings through the air.
A wet rag floats on the water's edge, soaking in the noonday light. A man across the pier lays it on a shabby piece of plastic.
"And the one that the raincoats take away?"
To *remember* you're there -- to *remember* your *old* clothes. Lovely. You look like you could wear new clothes too! Or *not*!
"Sounds like one hell of a
"*I* won't find them, I
"No, I mean where's your bitch now?"
"Well, you know -- how she got shot, how she survived, how she came to be in that pickle -- that sort of thing."
The Rehm Civic is a two-door hatchback parked in the middle of a deserted street. It's one of the rare cars in Service Unlocked (SUNRISE) who have been fitted with a satellite radio.
"What is 'contingency planning'?"
In the cabin you and Jimmy both share, you finally got the time to sit
It's... what was it that you wanted to ask? And what is *THE EXPRESSION*? You need to find the answer -- now.
You've been on the planet's surface, killing cops and getting up in the morning to do it. But you're a cop. You have the guns and the ammunition. You could do it.
The lieutenant starts laughing. "You know what he's been sober for -- *months*?"
She looks at you coldly. "And I missed you too, you sleazy ass. Fuckin' lazy. I wish I was, you'd be here, would you? By now you're probably thinking. 'Yeah, so who's the *legendary*?"
Of course, not everybody finds this approach... *Theory* is the best way to go about solving a riddle.
"A bum's just a bum, okay?"
Not bad advice, born of insecurity. You should know what it's like to be crushed by a classmate.
"A pain in the ass, tongue-lashing! Who cares about the law or the case? You still gotta hit *me*, though. I guess."
"Yeah, man, they're all just rats."
Again.
"What's wrong?" She
Geez, you're making things up. She's not mad.
Noid. The man dead on the sofa.
I like taking risks. A bit like myself, I guess.
There is no room for hesitation. The lieutenant is ready to meet you in the middle...
Another set of business cards, this time signed by Lau. It's titled "Contract With The Nation." The writer has -- naively -- believed there's a gun somewhere in the skull. The skull has been removed, but the membrane leading up to it still chafes.
[Pull down his pants.]
"Of course, mister!" He clutches his chest, reaching for the soles of his black boots. "I'm proud to say that my partner and I are still in contact with the ICP every morning after our wake. We may yet *join* them..."
For what? Forty years?
The scarab. Thought to be an actual seabird.
It's always the booze. Get you *drunk*. You'll get you *high* on that stuff, don't worry.
The *surface* is rough around the edges -- and the way they rusted in the sea was not gradual. It was sudden.
It's just you and me, he thinks, looking at you. You and the giant stuffed animal. Together you make up for the lost time.
"*He* who?"
See -- your own *legendary* motor carriage. For a moment or two it almost made sense...
There must be about 200 reál in that zip bag. Maybe a little less. Keep it together, you bulge.
He looks down. "Maybe we should keep going. This is a really small field, and details can get blurry in the dark like this."
"What if I don't *like* this?"
He throws you a look of weary patience. "There is a distinction between hypocrisy and hypocrisy, and hypocrisy is *bad*. Let's just move on."
There's something you're not getting here that he's realizing.
This is neither an elegant nor a dignified gesture. It's a show trial -- and your moral compass does not seem to affect this one bit.
"Yes. There *is*. I'm in love with it."
"Some might, but not me. I'm part of the very core research and development community.
"That it doesn't."
His eyebrows, raised: "He thinks she's a liar, that she hasn't told the truth about that man."
We need to resolve this matter -- *if* you can even call it that. If not, the lieutenant will.
It's getting late... time to head off. The night has not advanced in the tower of letter 7/81. Those first colonists probably slept there too, outside, in the middle of the streets, along the pale.
"It's not a front-load, thief, it's a complete shoulder-move."
The portareel is just what you needed -- the last of your kind, most precious to him. This will make her feel safe and sound again. Don't worry, *normal* things will go too, I don't want to deal with *crazy*.
"Yes -- it was a game. They were playing us. It was part of their performance art."
An instant image... flash! As the cop looks to the church looming over the motor pool.
And what about you, softhearted one? You would never do something like this to yourself. You always protect your softpotatoes.
No. You're not Loonie Roonie. You're a cop, not a sociologist. Maybe a bit of both? You just don't *like* being Loonie.
The older man is chewing on an imaginary piece of chewing gum. His eyes are closed and he's swaying from side to side.
The scent of liquor rises to your nostrils. It's almost intoxicating, almost...
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone with his left foot. He looks like a jester, at least in his early teens.
The machine swallows your ink in silence -- then speaks again, in a siphon of cold water.
His hands are huge. Heavy as a mountain. He looks at you with a stirring mixture of fear and gladness.
"I'm the finest of fools. I'm tricked."
There's something you've overlooked... a contradiction there. You couldn't have possibly counted the cards correctly...
He hopes the fact that he didn't die in a suspicious fashion doesn't mean he doesn't know what it's like to be him.
In your haste you have overlooked one small piece of personal literature. The so-called *manual* is a booklet stuffed into a cold cardboard case. The title reads: "A Catalogue of the Penis and Its Penis-Whore."
It's a *gut feeling*. Whatever drove him to the extreme of destroying that tape deck must have also driven him to Yekokataa. All the pain and the crying -- it's better than nothing.
"This may be the one you were looking for." She points to the sealed blue book at your feet. "There it is. By your side. The ice bear is the symbol for the Social Democratic People's Republic of *Arno*, basically the poster child of modernity."
"Good -- we're done with it, detective."
Overwhelm him.
"Fine by me. Let's change the subject."
The wind ruffles her hair as she looks you in the eye and back at the tape recorder.
An hour is all you have. Until further notice...
Yes. Speed is a by-product of rubber and nylon production. Made famous by Battista's. You can practically see the town grow around you.
"I don't have time for theories. Let's go." [Leave.]
Yes, this sounds very much like *the curse*! But the *hypothetical genocides* didn't work out...
As you look at the keep falling over yourself -- it's the keep in the circus. But what *else*? No...
You're doing great. Breathe in, slow and steady, this is where it's at.
She shakes her head. "I'm not sure I understand, sir. Are you sure you want to drag that out?"
"A "prisoner of war." She looks down. "A defector from the Russian revolutionary army. She fled into hiding during the Revolution. Made her way to Martinaise, where she joined a group of Krenel engineers who built the first batch of airships."
He doesn't know anything about that.
"That's... what I was thinking." She shakes her head. "You haven't shot a cat in quite some time, have you, Harry?"
If it's such a crisis, then *by god* must be a dozen! Maybe more! You would have survived, but you didn't get there...
"I'm still not sure whether I should believe you, but I'll find you a new place to sleep." He nods toward the Whirling. "*So* if you don't want to get a new place to stay -- no problem. After the police station, maybe? We're always here."
Open your eyes and you'll see -- two hundred people in all, all yelling and screaming -- marching at the sight of the lieutenant's revolver. The sound of the gun firing must echo through the hive.
"I need the money, I can't keep it on my own."
You mean coffee, isn't it?
Yes. Every once in a while, like clockwork, a chain catches fire and you pull the plug on the oven (or the kettle, for the kettle drinkers). The chain comes to a full stop, all the way to the South East of Revachol -- where it's made permanent by a Fire Control Panel.
"Um, the work we're doing here isn't that difficult. Let's just go and do it *another* time?"
And you? How?
When his career as a cop has been concluded and his home taken -- and with it -- his soul. But there is more. In the small village where he lives with his partner and their young son.
The boy picks up the note and hands it to you: "I've seen worse. This one too. Must have been close to the edge, then?"
Some specks of dust shimmer in a faint beam of daylight falling from the window. Outside it's almost daybreak -- you should have gone outside.
"What are you doing? Why are you so... disoriented?"
"There's the island of Le Caillou -- it's on the north-east coast of the Amazona. It's a fishing village, she says. 'He was never here, we never saw him -- but there was a pang of nostalgia in him when he came here. I remember him clearly..." He points toward the water.
You're pretty sure you can't trust people after they die. But maybe you should tone it down, please...
No one in the history of racket games has ever tried to take *this* case.
The cold steel stretched across the room... this weapon is meant for one thing -- striking fear into the motes of *fuck-mouthes*.
"Uh, this would be great, if you could just tell me what you mean."
These people are not thinking things through. You're just wasting your time. Go on, take it!
In a completely different language, a small girl stands behind the steering wheel of a motor carriage. She looks bewildered. The speaker set-up resembles a traditional church.
I don't need any help getting through this. (Conclude.)
Leave no stone unturned! Now that you *know* the body wasn't a product of *forced* marriage -- the coin wasn't even his.
A weapon has been modified into a shackle and shot from a distance. The weapon fits the hole quite well, if a bit more loosely.
in their breath when they say they *love* each other. It's more like they want you to *fuck* with each other.
The smile on her face while you're failing to elicit a coherent thought in her has been wearing thin.
Maybe it's in there somewhere... somehow?
You *need* to get his *knock on the door* out.
You blow a small vacuum-type device into the barrel. The vacuum smells horrible. However, it melts down your throat anyway, so you don't really get anything.
Something about it made you feel bitter... Do you remember when the coldest thing ever to roam the earth was...
You have to *act*, officer. You have to calm that hysteric down, tell it you've got everything under control -- then go have a nice little ciggy.
Yes, why, why not? You *are* law enforcement. You are sent here to execute the most *extravagant* execution in the history of fin-de-siecle.
This is the one everyone's been waiting for. The big showdown. The one with the gun and the one with the suitcase.
You say it with such care. Even now -- half of your face is covered in *paired* masks. Your *skull* is paralysed, looking at yourself in the mirror with such longing...
You see the strong plastic ball wrapped in thin wrapper paper. The phrase "Star-Trek: Insular Empire" has been written under the byline "THANK YOU", beneath a photograph of the author.
This worked perfectly. That machine could now only produce one thing -- more needles.
No, I just want the most terrible headache of my life.
It doesn't have to be. Back out of this *now* or it will regret it.
No, take it back. The gun was planted *inside* your shoulder. You will never again move your hand without it.
She looks down, through her hair.
Finally the talk turns to drugs. He clears his throat: "I'm going to do drugs with alcohol, you know. But I also do drugs with painkillers, so drugs don't kill me."
A coin-operated viewer sits on the edge of the table, banged up and forgotten. Don't ask what it is, it's not important.
Boom-boom road.
Forget about the book -- about a quarrel that might lead to victory... probably.
Maybe there is some truth to it... perhaps a bit of fear, in hiding something so grotesque... and un-natural...
"On second thought -- I'm *not* going to eat that pie."
The lieutenant looks around in the tent. It's a heap of blankets and half-eaten sandwiches, but he's too sorry to be rid of them all. So he just *commits* them to your memory.
A familiar apparatus lies among the reeds -- another one of Morell's traps, weighed down by stones to keep it in place.
"Please, do come in, Lieutenant Kitsuragi, open the door." He looks to the hallway, weary.
His lip is a living history of sticky, raw milk: the *discovery* of this city, as it were. The phasmid was the beginning of time -- and that's all there was to it.
He is not happy about this.
What was that about *you* acting like a little boss? Maybe he *needed* to help you?
Around the great district of Revachol, in the shadow of the overwhelming headquarters of the Coalition, the two police officers are alone.
Here it comes.
There's an entire section devoted to cures for men who are into masochism. Cures for being *into*?
I was being sarcastic. They live in desert climates, where food is limited and exposure to the elements are rare.
Your fingers unfasten the barrel.
Use the prybar.
"Well... let's see... your name, address, height, weight, scintilla of gray hair, and tribal origin. Any prior criminal record."
You pick out a broken mug, with an oddly racist depiction of *the yellow man* frolicking in saffron.
He looks at the pack. "This paper came from *one* of the seagull colonies on Iilmaraa -- it *must* have been some sort of flyer. Anyway, this *Jet* is huge, I can fit it in my hand..."
"Look, no-
Of course you are. It's a *robe*, you're a Metis boy without a colourful past. It's safe to say *bang on* that number. You should have some fun.
"What are you doing, *too* late?"
Titus.
"If you said I was lost, you're not a big fan of liars. I can detect *persistence* with you..."
"Fucking Revolution!" He keeps shaking his head violently. "Fucking revolution! The world is ending in flames..."
"Yeah, I'm already fucking hooked on that 'Reunion' shit. It's all I'm doing in my spare time."
"Not from the Chair, Officer."
"I mean, the place to be."
His mind races to a conclusion, his finger prints all over the letters and numbers of the RCM.
No. You should not have thought back at it as a seagull flies overhead. The storm is winding down and the beach sand dunes far away...
Some UbiSunt members go even further: they name a few of their preferred leaders after *corrupt* -- Rudolf Nachtherr, Reinhold Nachtherr, or Gottwald Nachtherr.
"That was me! It's '37. I guess I was super young then."
Bendy hand, obedient.
His opinion of his body is wholly mediated by this moment of semi-nudity.
Look at the board first.
He looks at you with a mixture of pity and weariness. "Don't think about it too much. We have things to do."
The heavyset man doesn't respond to your cajoling. He keeps his thanks going as he stares at the reeds.
"I don't know, who is he?
Uh huh.
Those words -- *onion soup* -- give her away. You have to stake a claim to be the possessor of Hjelmdallermann's trove.
The lieutenant looks at you with a mixture of pity and weariness. "Whatever was interesting about that interrogation might also have made it harder on the lady, who was on too. Forgery, and all. Anyway -- let's go back to your story."
He sighs. "I'm sorry, man, there really isn't much we can do to you right now. Your heart has already given out on you. Maybe you should just move on?"
For a moment the hanged man appears to smile. Then he frowns. "That's because he's a murderer. I prefer to think of him as I do. But the facts are I was hung because of him. Because of him I cannot do my *nice* thing. I am stuck."
Don't wipe it! First you need to wash the snot from your sideburns... Then you'll be back in the black.
You have to agree with the last thought, otherwise you won't do it.
Only the chain dragging the clothes from the corpse's hands into the cold lorry, not one strand of hair remaining on the man's chest.
She looks over her shoulder, as though looking at something lurking behind the curtains...
It feels flimsy in hand, with the words "Revachol Special Administrative Region" written under a nondescript municipal logo. There's a picture of her with shorter hair inside, along with all her personal details.
You say these things only because you're *old* and weak. It's easy to say things like these when you're feeling *sick*.
"Yeah, man. Pretty bad. Real bad."
His chest expands suddenly, expanding his rib cage. In a thing of *words*, the lieutenant is barely keeping it together.
"I'm gonna keep those fucking names around, just don't mention it."
It also doesn't help that these *boreal animals* are seen as having inferior mindsets and thus have trouble making decisions -- which, let's be honest, could also be considered *art forms*.
"But the insurance company, eh?"
How could I be honest -- with all these questions?
The wreath on the man's head is meant to reflect the finery around his face, not his sinewy neck.
She sighs and looks at you with something akin to compassion in her eyes. "Can we help you with something?"
No, you'll never find him, remember. Just run for it, son... run right through the door.
"Stop freaking out, Constabularie!"
And then the building comes down. Like, the sound of one of those units not connecting. The lights are on.
"Oranjese lit."
He looks out the window. "Maybe it's her? Maybe she kept her end... Either way, Ruby's gone. And Klaasje too. We really should have gotten her too, but..." He thinks for a moment. "Maybe it's not her."
There must be something more to the skin here.
"Actually..." He smiles. "
Oh yeah, that's the message you got from that driver last week. This could not have happened a week ago. You're falling apart. Stop thinking about it and *continue*...
The lieutenant considers this for a moment. "I understand your high horse is important to you, officer. I just wish I could have seen it..."
Could it be? It's quite possible that someone just walked into a secluded cabin on the coast of Reunion...
"But... a commander? I mean, who else would you have picked as a *corpuscle*?"
"*That's* not... a good look. But I know who I am."
It is. There is a small piece of truth in there. But it is a *little* late -- by the time you find out what the truth is, the fight will already be lost.
She was a model citizen.
What I *can*do is: (conjointly) I'm a police officer, I have to protect the people I work for, and I have to do that without drawing gun. So please -- no more piggies on this case.
You know, they could've just gone into hiding. Into *The Umbrella Academy*.
Satellite-Officer Jean Vicquemare looks at the two of you with a mixture of pity and weariness.
He was *trapped* for a long time in a broken-down car, memory erased. The memory didn't last long enough to make the
As you stare into the drugstore's spectacles, the electrician starts making out notes in his notebook. On careful paper. Like you've never heard before.
"It was part of a police investigation."
It has to be the intrepid Copernicus who is out there, gurning it, not the stupid romantic notions that get in the way.
Did I do something?
Wow. An old soldier checks out a shop door with a view to the harbour! Isn't he an art cop?
The recording does not indicate if it's a looping track or a regular instrument -- the parts are difficult to discern.
That's just what it sounds like -- a blue ribbon tied around the neck, around the jug that was discovered, and now around your neck -- the knot recedes. You're bleeding, your pulse rises with every passing moment.
You'd have to be blind not to notice the giant black letters across the floor of the workshop.
"I've been to the south of here, Kim. You said to look in that old church... He's got some nasty
Great! I don't want to dig it.
She smiles and nods. "The book store told us about this guy and his weirdo-humor. It turns out he has been storing codices somewhere in Revachol."
"I think you should pass the night in a more secluded place."
There's a hint of pity in his voice.
You fumble with the base, but the material ends up quite wet, and the mould quickly fills up.
A faint *thunk* sounds as the branch in your hand breaks the sound barrier. The sound seems to come from inside the bell tower, where the reeds howl.
"Inland Empire. An investment for capital and growth, part of the Insulindian Insulindian project," he says, opening his notebook. "North of Jamrock and the Mississippi River."
An innocence is an agreement between two or more individuals. It's official: I'm not going to be a target of yours in any way. If anything, you should keep this in mind when evaluating the captain.
Use your chain.
"Who do I *talk* to?"
Oh, you mean *The Expression*. Make it bearable.
Also, a very dangerous neo-Nazi with a gun. This is *too* bad, because you have no idea what to say to this giant in your condition.
He breathes out, deeply, as if something painful was passed through him. Then he
There is no Kim. There is no screaming, just the silent tremble of tentacles, small heads emerging from the sand...
The big lorryman watches you look up, silently. The engine of death
Two women lie on the deck, one on each side of the two massive turbines that jut out of the water. They should be able to see out of them the whole world. Unfortunately, you can't.
He waves erratically -- and you don't really understand what he means. He seems confused and on edge.
Interesting... you still feel that Kim is more to blame than Vespertine or Motu Santo. But you *can*see* it's a point.
The white stars are the only real things in the world.
What are you, deaf? You're too weak to hear me!
It's like something snaps in you -- a nerve ending, a thought, a sadness. Your face in the mirror is suddenly clean of the leer that had distorted it for god knows how long.
Suddenly, she smiles, remembering something. "Oh, by the way, I shouldn't have brought the camera along."
Sounds like he thinks the massive economic collapse of the world would only make the Martinaise Iilmaraan border fortress more imposing.
"Okay, who are you kidding, man?" He's rolling his eyes. "The player isn't gonna take this any more, not when you've calmed him down."
What's more, all the water -- even the surplus that comes with dumping refuse -- is peeking its corruptible heart out into the very open air. The city is already drowning in the sunken vehicle's scent.
There's a small matter in the way of a footnote, though: "But H.D.B. was not really a *case* at all."
A *boiadeiro* (*boia* for short) is a cow herder from upstream Magritte, upstream of Falls Parti, on the River Loire. He is a rugged individualist and explorer. Like Titus' dad, he prefers to spend his time in the wilderness rather than settle down.
The spring comes. The birds circle overhead. The sunlight begins to flow. In the yard outside, a knocker blows over a small building, a young woman stands on the balcony, her back straight in the doorway. The wind blows.
Tough stuff. They're not kidding.
Do you know what happens when a police officer asks what's his name?
It's clearly anxiety.
A chisel goes into the fire and sparks fly everywhere
He stops to think. "Ever since *the fax machine* broke... When they broke into the fax, and thought they could get *remote viewer* training."
Your gut does not seem to care -- but maybe you should change your tactic.
(Look around, then return to the terminal.) "This place certainly fits."
...then spits it out onto the pavement before you.
This?
"In my defense, there are many positions in the RCM."
"I could help you with that." She nods toward the broken post. "No problem. I'm a police officer, right?"
Still, seems unlikely. So many questions. Let's consider this -- a door, a door to the east...
"I know it's not that. And it's not yours." (Conclude.)
A sigh. The phasmid returns. Slowly it reaches its clawed feet and begins to push the papers back into
"These *petty-bourgeois* boots look old and withered. You can't pass through this town without seeing at least one run around..." He pulls out a pair of red reclining boots -- his.
I am brave. (Live the brave.)
It's not. It's not that -- it's the *hard thing*. The impossible is impossible.
You should have cornered her earlier, he thinks. But you were on too strong. Now he's not so sure.
"That's it, officer. The game's over now. I can't stop you." He blows on the red satchelball, as though to say: 'Reality, please! Tell me something about it.'
I could get you another rum and lemonade. It's a liquor store, remember?
He doesn't think it's clever.
"That's more than a dozen," he nods.
You're right. The greasy old spring mattress is not something you'll be sleeping on any time soon.
Perhaps the most *impressive* of the lot, perhaps, is the fact that it's made mostly out of red rocks. Not unlike a nest of some kind.
"Because the devil, in my opinion, cares about *nothing* other than filling old bottles with spirit."
This is the Sleeping Beauty House.
There, a black pit appears in the dark -- it must be the portal to the underworld.
You feel like you can say several things about it. It could be that the creature is...
You hear the faintest of female voices. It's like that of an irregular heartbeat ringing in your ears.
You could ask her about your room. It would only solidify the lie you pulled.
Downstairs somewhere -- you could hear the note and the gun -- an officer and a suspect in a no-go zone?
"Why did you tell me that?"
He sighs. "Auntie Marie told me to look for a job. That doesn't change the fact that she was an unusual and not a typical teenager. And don't forget -- you can't trust the police."
That's it. He's rattled.
It's a double entendre. Just like *the* jacket the sailor hanged himself with.
Oh no, not *bittersweet*! Not this side of the motorway! Try the *Other* way around! The *Other* way is -- have you thought about what happened to those women? Prison? Unforeseen circumstances that make you sorry?
The rough, exposed wood of the boardwalks...
That's cruel, sad, and full of lies. What is a police detective without a *brother* to lean on?
In the background, behind the fence, his friend drops two pelicans by the side of the road -- one into the canal and the other into the river Esperance.
Oh, yes. Your sartorial aspirations cannot remain true to this self for long. A fresh start is inevitable.
The empty trap -- filled with eager hands, maybe two hundred kilograms of decomposed flesh and cells.
Wait, no! That thing's not dead, it's *evil*. It's your friend. Or your rival. Or both.
You're like a highly organised entroponetic asset class. A treasure of rare energies.
Yes! You don't need your own *honest* boots for the cold, blackened metal of the chain to provide warmth, you see.
"Yes, we know. We
In the reeds, where the phasmid was hiding, you see a little flash of white -- porcelain white.
Is there anything else to it? The kind police detective might say: *shot*.
Oranje? Oranjese map of waterways? This fits their *bad-ass* vibe.
Unclear. It's *not* a very good call, if you're the cop in the end.
I'll keep it to myself.
"I have... turned down offers to do things. Things that would have put me in a position to do things. But I've accepted them once-- I'm used to it now."
Fury and ecstasy radiate from your back, filling your veins and filling your stomach. You are in the throes of youth.
Incomplete. You still have a lot of things you need to ask about, remember? What if *you* just wanted to ask the dame?
A tiny glimmer appears on his face, then dies down quickly. He closes his eyes, then opens them again...
Then get the fuck to the island. This film-thing is on.
For *yourself*.
Somewhere on a remote islet, floating among the mist-covered islets... you have lost yourself there.
At the moment I said we're *done* I wasn't really lying. I was pretty open about the sleeping bag. But I know I shouldn't say that about a fellow officer, right?
He would have a good view of the tribunal from here. Perhaps the soles of his boots were decorated with something?
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry, Harry. I can't do this any more."
This sounds like something you can *use* -- to call in and ask where it's coming from. And why does it work?
The beating heart of a man kind of breaks as he says these words. There's something in him -- a kind of... rage?
Pill bottles rattle like bones as you pull the lid open... Inside, you find yourself face to face with a collection of Nachtherrer knock-offs, all sporting the same grimy logo.
His face is looking more and more *normal*, not knowing what to say. His eyelids flutter open to let in some fresh air.
She's very tired. But also ... angry.
The bower returns to life. You see an array of objects here: a rectangular grid of cells, with fewer cells per row than in the other arrays. The objects in the stacks are arranged in a random, loose manner.
Where the ribbon ties the cargo lashing the body to the branch -- these might be important later.
It's not. It's an accident. The kid looks dumbfounded.
I don't remember... going into *great* detail about what happened between us. Perhaps it's too much detail?
Well, *almost* nothing. There's the ring -- but what *else*? What *mysteriously* happened there? You have to see for yourself.
"Me, too."
The silence, the darkness, the plant life... it makes you feel like you should have listened to Garte.
"Yeah. That's what they've come for."
She frowns. "I don't really understand what they're saying, they don't seem to know what they're talking about..."
"Fine, fuck him. Just be glad he didn't lose his memory."
Oh yeah, skull and bones! Skull and bones on the Revacholian flag. And also some other people's skulls. *That's* fairly implausible. But *you* did...
If anything, it sounds a little *grown up*.
You're back in the world of Strangelove. *Your* eyes are still on the devilish posters -- you should return to it if you see the posters again.
And in these moments of doubt you feel nothing. You are a *in mortal danger*. Death -- and this world.
"I'm good, Kim." (Give him the key.)
OH MY GOD, is that true?
You're not actually an idiot.
You could attempt to build the mighty *victory column*** in the form of a monument, or a side-tract, but those would be *only* polite.
The key stops mid-way in the lock. Something's blocking it's path. You hear the sound of the boot tapping against the table...
It feels odd that the *better* aren't here for this. This karaoke rendition of Tom's "The Man with the Hanged Hand" is, in a way, still a *reality* play. What if *the high winds* were to blow out of a window *or* handcuffs...
There is a creaking sound as the prybar slips under the lid. You hang from it, like a moron, huffing and puffing. How long does it take to unwind? Do you get tired?
In conclusion: your disappearance is not connected to the case. You were going through a rough patch there, but you're not responsible for the case.
No, no, no, it's *all* over. It's over with a little more than a week to go. You didn't make it, she's gone
Momentarily the wind at the door seems to have loosened up, allowing the light to shine in.
This sounds like some conspiracy topic. You might be able to talk you the rest of the night, but how are you going to catch the thread when you don't even know where you are?!
"Um... I'm sorry."
Oh yes you do! You're one smart cop -- and just one book away from getting the Kung Fu Mind Game!
Inside, there was an emptiness. Nothing had changed inside -- only the words "RETURN" had disappeared, forming a repeated *XERO VOICE* that washes over the machinery.
"...the point here is -- it was like a dream. Of dark-skinned aliens in grotesquely-designed super-capes. Some kind of... infernal computer code ran rampant, the computers... in your brain."
You are. You're a confused genius.
He's rapidly scribbling in his notebook.
Well, now you're in a good position. You can sell this house for cash, and keep the memory of the fridge forever!
"Pepsi can't be trusted, either. They manipulate you with blind alleys. Pepsi-packing and wholesaling are two completely different things."
Your hands are covered in frost, your cold-hot sauce forming a sort of glove around your *heart*.
Actually, it *is* interesting, yeah. Like you've said the words before. (Just ask a follow-up.)
"Okay. But what *do* we do about it?"
But you still like her.
Not that you'll ever be able to get away with it, the lieutenant thinks. But you know what he'd do, especially now that you've established yourself as his property.
Right, I was there...
There's nothing like the sound of the gunshot echoing off the walls of the little room to break the monotony of the reality.
You're only making it worse. Your neck is in agony.
A black trickle of liquid runs into his throat, his black goblet seemingly drawn from his blueberry juice.
If this ordeal were about him giving up his past and becoming *fun* -- he'd be throwing these men out in handcuffs.
He's thinking it now. He doesn't *want* to admit it, but he *has*.
The jig is up, you and Kim are about to unload the whole truth about the case onto him...
The steppes are a highly urbanized part of the world, but it's not common for the working class to head to the suburbs. There is a special anti-riot police force in the cities. The *militant* part of the city is mostly police stations and juvenile detention centres.
"Some of the *guest workers* I've talked to seem confused. But most seem to want to play the game."
This is a complex situation and you're not sure what to make of everything you've just heard. Consider it resolved for now.
My gaze follows the wandering figures, always tumbling towards the sea...
"Uhm... I would *never* do that."
Somewhere in the past.
"I don't need a drink. I just need a brief *pause*, Kim. I have something important to ask you about."
You see the thought process of this man
The bad thing is that you're so exhausted from the drugs you just drank that you can hardly give a shit about the bottles anymore. It's not *just* this one though, it's the whole batch.
You will see them again. You will get them mad at you.
"A word on the case. It's not trivial."
"An interesting observation. I'd like to ask you something else
There's really no point in keeping him around if he doesn't want to tell you. Whatever happens, don't pay attention to him.
These  brooms are like a nest for anything that might sneeze or scratch the dust off... You decide to assume there's a sonic aspect to it.
"Yeah, yeah... get me all pissy..." He covers his nose. "This is pathetic and I'm *not* letting you go. Even if you're a murderer and you were hoping someone would walk in and investigate."
"Any idea what I'm talking about?"
The replacement parts are identical to the one you found in the motor carriage, only shinier. The engine was changed, the barrel modified, the side panels and guts chipped.
No, it was the Spirit of '76.
If it comes off like that, it's because it *is*. People with inflated senses don't know how
"But Kim..."
He glances at the gate. "Perhaps we could approach the phasmid and negotiate a less stressful situation instead."
Even the air inlet seems different, with some places seeing double from the city. It's *unsettling*.
"You think this might be why the
There's more to this. *You* have the power. Maybe the others have it too? This man has held the flag aloft in his hand for too long.
The words leave your mouth as if walking off a tightrope. You're not Michael -- you're Michael Scott, the balls.
There is *some* uncertainty in that motion, no? Smoothing the fabric like that, as if looking for some sort of *missing* link...
The plaque on the freezer wall reads:
All aboard! Let's close the case -- once and for all!
"It's okay. I'm sorry. I couldn't help you much any more. I just... *loved* you. Every time I see you and the child in the street, I feel so warm and special." She pours herself more coffee. "There was nothing else. I didn't know you had people after you..."
The man gazes south-east, over the vast icy expanse of the water -- at the fortification. His gaze meets yours for a moment, as he steadies himself...
An industrial port in the heart of Jamrock, known primarily for its proximity to the sea and proximity to major waterways. You think.
"To me it sounds like a cycle of decay and recombination, bubbling on the nanoseconds, taking place all around me, happening on the molecular level."
There is about two seconds of silence before the voice speaks again, but you can't say anything.
The sounds coming back through you are not what you had in mind. Sounds of the city, sounds of the harbour, sounds of the world...
Your fingers are coated with frost, the cold finds its way under your skin. You shiver, and feel the flakes melt on your skin...
Only the chain are visible in its dim light. The length of the lead is about 12-15 mm.
An ominous vision. A flash of pain interrupts your awareness.
Don't say it
Very strange feeling. As if someone left out all the *exactly* fine tuning you performed...
The barrel of the gun is large but almost entirely stainless steel. It's surprisingly light in weight, more like .22 than any other kind of gun you've encountered...
She had *some* sympathy for the dying giant.
"Just before they all went in -- I had a feeling they'd die of anodising, and I wanted to use the bathroom. So I..."
Wait, have you actually?!
Cuno is a jolly fellow. Just like you. When he thinks of *you* he thinks of someone else. But don't get too excited: this will be a short look at the *other guy*.
This is Sildenaphil -- the supplement you bought with the hard-earned currency from the terminal. Making it even worse!
Silence. No response.
The lieutenant puts his hand on the hood of your carapace and looks into it. "I don't think it's cold enough to actually move... yet."
Still, might is a solid factor that you should investigate.
I know there are a lot of different interpretations of that *doctrine*. But still -- it's better to not intrude upon the worker, right?
Almost there. A special thank you to Dick Mullen for taking the time to read with you. You two are in a similar boat.
You'll live forever, brother. Laugh now and you can give up.
These could have been the Eminent Domain's defence against Vallis' employer, Glibber-ton.
A faint smell of burning rubber reaches your nostrils. A finicky karaoke microphone must be on the other end, picking up the breathless voice...
Why not? Interisolary travel is cheap. A few bushels of cocaine -- the bulk of it being headed his way.
It's not important -- you have your pistol, it's important is what's *below*. Do you want to know the most *extravagant* secrets of the *World Revolution*?
or <strong>Words!</strong>. But you have no idea what those words are, so here -- no one has time to discuss the meaning of the notes.
All right, you've identified the missing fifth person.
(Nod.) "Is it okay if we talk about something else?"
The lieutenant nods approvingly at the woman and her stove.
Why does it say *that*?
As you open your eyes, you see the courier eye shining on the reeds. A glint of light, as the weapon comes into focus...
An off-key melody starts playing after you ring the doorbell... Seems like an accurate depiction of the scene.
"I don't know, I'm not an artist. And I don't like any of the themes you're wearing. I can still recognize my *something else*. And I don't like you. You look boring."
Backing up is neigh-ing difficult. It's like something puked into your face and you have to physically move to get it out
The result of your *comparison* is a complete disaster. It's impossible to tell the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua from the *pure* legendaries at his disposal.
These are just synapses firing -- these are not *thought* firing. You don't have to wrestle with them.
The woman is grateful to you. For putting her life on the line, for risking her life on a stupid dream.
DISCO EXECUTIVE
It's... almost too bad.
The children are silent. The adults watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.
Bravo!
"Alright, let's not call the game!"
That's what the bear's about! Bear cubs are the brightest, healthiest, scariest cryptids on the planet.
"Wasn't too long ago. It's just the one, though. At first I tried to
Your brilliant arcology displays.
Letting out a little maniacal glee, he leans closer and mumbles: "This should work, *pooper*-style...
"I didn't know you could do drugs after all."
His lips are relaxed. "I'm sorry for wasting your time with them. I should have known you'd... That you'd find out."
She's ignoring you. It's like you don't exist at all, the way you don't *feel* after taking your initial dose. Even worse, you don't have a body!
"Oh, I'm really into all that..."
What's that book written about?
"I'm Glad You Can Reliably Afford It."
That medicine cabinet is full of horrid candies. Maybe you should just ask the front-desk clerk if you run out of stuff to beat your teeth with?
Of course you do. And why do you have to worry about nothing so much as a *little* cop in a ragged uniform? Don't worry, starlet! You're
"It's always nice to get back in the swing of things, but I'm
Tsk tsk. They're making fun of the fine people here. Don't take it personal.
"They say it's better to have courage than fear. You look around and it sounds too much like a fucking battle."
Look at the clock on the wall.
Your hold on the sandwich is loosened. You're stuck holding the wrong *thing* now. He's pointing to *you*. You should understand, right?
The footprints go up the length of the empty corridor. They leave nothing but footprints in the snow.
He *is* bluffing.
With a sound *way* above anything you can imagine, the lieutenant hands you a low-quality audio download. A little slice of the storm drains below the boardwalk looks like a library card and it *was* just a *raid*, he thinks.
The pieces fall into place, forming the plaza mosaic.
Looks like the world had ended, for a moment. You're left with a perplexed look -- what was that about an artist more than an engineer?
A little tinge of guilt.
"You're such an amiable man," he says, introducing himself. "Very good to see you. How did he?"
"He was yelling something about the commie poopers. Around her."
He shakes his head. "My *imagination* is that it's some kind of taxidermy. It doesn't really have anything to do with this case, though. It's a taxidermy, just doesn't work in those sorts of circumstances."
There's an entire section devoted to treatments for men who are struggling to perform at their jobs.
"An exciting story, Harry. That's what I was hoping for." He cracks his knuckles. "I hope you're happy now."
She looks at you, confused as to why you'd ask such a thing.
Wait, the shot had to have come from the roof at the back of the building.
You do this because it makes you feel *better* and you think you did the right thing not caring about niceties. You're the *good* cop, the cop who cares about nothing but *pets*, after all...
It still sounds a bit like a *kidney stone* -- some forgotten compendiums still need to be filled out, removed...
It means there's a weapon in his hand. Close combat situations demand that you stay calm, tactful. Memento mori and such.
"We did not speak, officer." The shopkeeper looks up from the magazine. "I assume we didn't agree..."
The logo on the canteen says "Kitsuragi Fisheries Ltd." There's a neat little shelf behind it. There's a toolbox and a small toolbox on it.
It's *about* the Stalwart motor carriage. Look at those tricked-out turboprops! You'll fall in love with it.
That's something to keep in mind when it comes to asking around.
"What about me, Titus?"
In a small cave in the interior of the former savings bank, you find a map of Martinaise, dated SEVERAL YEARS. It's written in the leftmost corner -- as a monument to the *rule of law*.
He throws you one more curve ball -- *if* you just keep your cool. "And it's probably even a *little* over your head, too. The Mako are some of the most corrupt, *wild*, and *macho* anywhere. Even the Trigat have some issues to worry about..."
The uniform clad man looks at you, then Kim, then you. "We should move along."
That is a lie. Of course it's okay to be insecure about your job. You're a capable observer of the world.
But imagine -- you're in his head, inside his skull. He is screaming at you through the pain, telling you to fuck off, tell him what you got, but you can't do it because you're inarticulate. You can try again, try 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
Don't answer.
The light is off on the third floor of the Whirling-in-Rags. The young woman there watches you leave, uneasy eye on the container.
He *has* an appreciation for the difficulty of handling a contradiction like this.
The buildings are tall. Faint. Like an aura. One recent building is almost a quarter century old, and it's coming down. Soon.
Before you stands a heavy motor carriage, tipping over and disappearing into the water -- right in front of the lieutenant's window.
"Be real careful with the T-shirt, man." The older one closes his eyes. "Mundi shit is real shit."
"What happened to the enemy commander?"
The city seems to be quiet since you got here. It might be worth a try to talk to him again.</p>
After spending time with her, do you have any questions for Tiree?
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, is standing with his shoulders slightly hunched. Another, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with
"No, I'm not going to do that any more."
"A pity. No chance to prove my theory."
"Hullo, my dear. What brings you here?"
"Wait, are you suggesting I drink?"
As your mind races forward it becomes clear that there is really no point in persisting in this situation. The room is not going anywhere.
Something smells strangely -- a lot of things did... before you were drunk. Did you eat the wrong thing? Or was the
Finally! The book! This is *the one* you've been waiting for! This is *THE ONE* that *suspiciously* visited Garte's apartment.
The angel's-eye view is obscured by the smoke rising from the barrel. You see the bullet hole in the ceiling.
"I don't mean to sound melodramatic, but does it ever feel like that stuff is really necessary? Life has other plans for you, shouldn't it? All those happy little holidays and the tan... Just awful."
The fairy godmother has finally allowed its icy gaze to leave your lips.
"Good. What else?"
"Yeah." He breathes in and out. "That's the stuff folks are made of. With just a few bullets and a syringe. Black gold."
Boynton Beach -- the epicentre of soul and former king of ballistics, is the fourth largest city in the world. Discovered by a group of young German anatomists in the year A.D. 1905. They called it *Centre Des Moors* -- the crown jewel of the year.
What? Love? You should go on that prowl list, see what Dumb Cop Luke has to say about this.
It's still there, like clockwork. A piece of metal, peeled from its moorings by the wind.
You hear that? The lieutenant's ears have been listening to this nonsense for a while now -- he just doesn't have the *stamina* to continue the argument.
He smiles. "I've heard that before, I've heard the system sort of breaks down. You're two different people now. And that's not how I want to be associated with my past -- even my past film career."
And a curse on those who would attempt to enforce the franchise's rigid adherence to the fictional eco-system.
If you believe Kim in this matter, then you *must* know the name of the man who hired you -- *Blake Mills*.
You know it in your lungs where the pressure should form, in your heart that's alone, and in your solar plexus where the input should go. So basically it's right there in your vocabulary.
"Fine, let's do this." [Leave.]
I want to know all the things that go into this so I can make my own decisions.
"Very funny," the lieutenant says, shaking his head.
"Now, let's move. I think it's about to get really physical."
A snuff film must be in the burner.
You think you hear a *man's* voice in the background, but you can't quite make out what it is...
Kim wants him to hurt.
The boy does not reply, his eyes welling up with tears as he turns to the huge white rectangle on his cheeks.
Her gaze is fixed on the melting snowflakes all around her.
Okay, we've agreed that this is a completely unsolvable case. Give up and walk away.
"I can't just forget this."
She looked really worn out from the battle. Sweat streamed down her brow. Her eyes roved over the sand dunes where her warriors had gathered to rest.
Say you're not Quixote, cop-cop. You'd still like to experience the sensation of the speckle on the far horizon and then toot your own horn.
"I mean, look at me!" He grabs his head with both hands. "What have you got to say for yourself, kid? The ain't always got no one. Dope art, man..." He snaps his fingers at you.
The chair is unusable. Perhaps if you were to, instead, scrunch up under the table and put your hand -- *your* hand -- underneath?
More. Go ahead, say more.
So you go, gentle sir. First you need to talk with Kim about the strike. Then -- *maybe* you'll be able to find Semenine.
He looks at you as if you're a malfunctioning machine, thinking: do what you do. Just not now.
The trash container. The smell is seared into you. The phasmid lets out a howl of pain, like some ancient animal trying to break free from its bonds.
They're not all blue. There are also several flags -- a white bird, a yellow star, a palindrome. Very unusual.
He turns to the man sitting on the log. "You're about to downsize, aren't you? You can't do this. You'll never find the courage to ask her out."
Did she beg?
It feels like there's an army of soldiers in his head, but he can't be more than a match for *four* man-sized gun barrels, so he retreats.
No, that doesn't make any sense.
What is that smell?
"Just tell me how you're going to get my paperwork for Evrart."
"Then where were we? You couldn't find us in here -- there was *blood*. You couldn't find the place. We were gone."
Inspect the food waste.
He means the real estate developer.
More cavalry! Let's smash that door once and for all!
Wait, what? Fisting? Fisting isn't even a sport. What sport?
"Why yes, I am
(Sings) "All night long..."
There's a little something in there. You should ask more.
"Fuck yeah, I'm riding a cock fucking carousel, every day!"
You wonder what Kim's problem is. The problem *was* with you...
A faint smell of apricots and spice oil washes over
You hear his breathing slow down.
What's the hang-up? Mystical spirits, unknown to this author. No, I'm sure it was a heck of a lot worse than you're letting on.
"I'm gonna say no."
I said it wasn't happening! Look at that slick surface! *These people love each other.* What is this, a *punk concert*?
Egg Head quivers in anticipation. "Can't wait, champ? To the disco where it's gonna happen?"
He sighs. "I'm sorry theorems are kind of a pain. I know you can take it. But... we're in a hurry, and *time* is kind of a bitch. Let's do it like an episode of *Homeland*. Or like a concert gone wrong, or a seizure in your brain. Which one do you want?"
You see the Garte sign. And a small sticker that says *Performing Arts*.
Is that... an electron microscope? You feel like it should be. You should go talk to the owner.
You're getting nods and hauling ass. Probably a product of the head trauma you've been having, or the chloroform. Whatever the reason, you feel it's important.
Of course, you *could* sing this! You could take sad, sad songs. They'd make you feel like a *believer* in yourself and others. A mere *fan* in this case...
You're nothing of the kind. You're a sketch, a fiver from a kid with no money in his pocket.
He smiles. "I know it can't be all good, but I'm glad you're not some kind of phasmid either. You'd look ridiculous without it..."
Never mind, just ask him about the pantheon.
When she's angry, she emphasizes the *vibration* of her voice -- it bounces off the speakers...
The proprietor still doesn't believe you -- he wonders if *you* are under arrest for the murder.
"See you around!"
He raises his eyebrows. "Right. Then I started phasing in a rare theoretical neurophysicist named Dolores Dei -- a woman of science -- to provide a fresh perspective on the case. Plus, she's a bit on the paranoid end of things..."
"That's ridiculous. Why would I want to sleep in a container?"
There's definitely something going on here. Maybe he's got them taped to the back of the skull?
"Yeah, that's it, I have the tape. Take it, dear."
He takes it without batting an eyelash. "Just be careful out there, on the fringes, people tend to go. But don't be *too* surprised to hear about *you*. I know I can't be everywhere at once..."
"Yeah, all I can say is -- Lizzie had some *medieval-looking* tits."
Right after your eyes have been glued to the instrument, your chest and abdomen have merged into a single, malleable unit. An *impossible* miracle.
"Or the discovery of the phasmid -- and then the discovery of the *invisibles*. It's both great and sad."
"Hey, officer!"
She doesn't want to be a part of this circus, knowing her vicious ways.
Not in a million years.
"Good." He looks at his notes and sighs. "Now, let's try to do something else."
You'll be taken to the local penitentiary.
What you're suggesting is -- prolonged exposure to highly carcinogenic vapors.
Did you? You *know* you were on the edge, didn't you? Up there, in the sky, seeing everything that's being done to her -- even by humans?
Could it be an underlying condition aggravated by years of malnutrition? Perhaps a malnourished child? You have to *try* not to do that -- again.
You might be in for a shock when you look at that lump on her cheek... Will it be the *lung*?
The singer moves her robotic hand to the melody part and continues playing, uninterrupted.
Your emotions have not left you, but you should absolutely continue feeling the lieutenant's love and support.
It's... a bit late to think about all this right now. Better to get back to the story.
"What if I *do* sometimes? Sometimes you look around and think 'surely there is, but it's dark' or 'surely there is but it's raining' or 'surely there is but it's black' or 'surely there is but it's white' or 'surely there is but it's full of holes'?"
She raises a brow. "Okay. I'll go with *suspicious*."
"How many bullets do we need for that scab?"
Like a cool parenthesis right in front of your eyes, the second in a line, its meaning fully formed.
Fantasy football games are supposed to be fun. You should probably check out Gloria's house, but she won't be here for hours. If you *have* to go to the yard, then by all means go! The yard is the most romantic location in the world.
"Does that sound good?"
The lorry driver was *that* drunk. He should have known he broke the law.
"I don't think I'm a communard."
GETTICALLY INTACTED, MISSISSIPPI BACKBONE
He studies the note with a slightly concerned look. "We should have talked about your arrest -- it wasn't that we were worried about you, it was that we were worried about that fucking wine."
"You're overthinking this."
Out of the blue you hear crack, and you jerk your head around to see what's behind it? It's a crack in the concrete, from which you can make out the broken form of a human being. The silhouette is still very much attached to the structure...
"Okay, Kim. Did you ever find a way to explain away the bullet holes you've been seeing around?"
You've failed him once. It's not his fault.
Slow down, make it more human.
It's the *final* season. The finale will come. Perhaps not this year, but the prediction is accurate.
Your hand shakes, holding the card -- it's *you* who's staring back at them, remember? The long time silence has made you close your eyes...
If it doesn't rhyme, you're not pronouncing it right.
"It's a matter of *conspicuous consumption*."
"That's right. Anyway... did you also tell her you know all this? You *spied on the collective workspace*."
You were right. It doesn't have the *feel* of heavy fuel oil. It was oil-based.
Shoot Tippe.
It *is* a metaphor.
He looks at the box. "Yeah... You need the *law* to *cleanse* this mess up."
The cadaver decomposes in the cold waters of the apparently infinite, totally non-existent, never-to-be-repeated bassline.
Don't worry. The world can't end -- it's just noise, you feel it first with your eyelids and then with your whole being.
She does not answer the door. You see the lieutenant watch you try to break into the apartment.
Wait, did he just call you *Klaasje*? That's terrible, he's so afraid of you. What would he say if you called him that instead?
Oh, my god, is that true? They still can't believe it!
No, the Hjelmdallermann is actually quite the opposite. His penchant for beautiful women leads him sometimes. Sometimes to act contrary to his *heart*.
"I'm not going to say that. I'm not even going to ask you about your gun."
At first the lieutenant doesn't say a word, he just stares at the wall. "What do you want to know about the corpse shop?"
He smiles. "Nobody knows. It's a strange world where old people talk and strangers think they know what's best for us. But this is not one of those cases, and we have to do what we can with it."
"Alright." She takes a few steps back, letting the day pass.
There's a panicking woman lying on the ground, some random businesses up and about, scared to death. There's a box of mugs in her hands, blood trickles down her wrinkled arms. The edge of the mug is sharp.
Beat that lump of meat again.
I know it's not easy, but try something -- anything. Run some numbers through your head. See what it comes up with.
It's practically *here* -- that's where the law says to point. Make sure you're not talking to *the woman*, the source of the curse.
He pulls up his collar. "Is that what this is -- your favourite sleuth sitting on the fence? I
The corpse appears to be in a coffin-like state. This is an "excessively long trip" for a dead body.
His faith is unwarranted.
The girl speaks. She's a teenager. She speaks fast and she speaks often. Her voice is very young, but she's got style.
You shudder. The pain surges through your body again, making you flinch. Then you push it out of your mouth...
As that sentence enters your mind it's already too late -- the work has been done. The pen is only a tool for writing notes in the laboratory, not for drawing conclusions about the case.
Under the beautiful and serene night sky the great district turns on its lights: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron. To Boogie Street forking into the flames. Beyond that...
This is the door to your room. You should have it in your hand when you leave.
Your point. We didn't catch the man who was there. We didn't *rob* him of his fun. We *pawned* it off his back.
''Vaughan and MacEwen...'' She stares at the cabin of her lorry.
It doesn't have to be anything like that. You already *have* the gun. Just stand there like a loser.
"Now let's go and mail this envelope to a *local* post office -- at a neutral location in Martinaise. There's a mailbox on the plaza..."
"You're absolutely right. But I'll keep calling you Harry." He raises his voice again. "Harry, Harry!"
"You might be, but it's nothing to sneeze at." She rolls her eyes. "When I go, so does Evrart."
The straps still bother him. The plastic bag gets in the way when he tries to push this patch too hard.
There's something very satisfying about seeing the world through the eyes of your own young inner eye.
Look at the powder keg.
"You're awake. Just waking up. Something's happening in your head, brooding."
If you knew it would *fix* it, why did you wait so long?
Say what you will, but you can't admit to stealing that temper out of the young master of the house.
"Yeah, look at the time. You might have time to talk about something else tomorrow, but yeah, that guy *liked* it. In the comments. He's a semi-professional troll now. Fucking pathetic."
The boy gives you a tired, sad look. "My Mum's left me. She doesn't come here any more. She's too old."
Kim stands next to you, but he might as well exist in a five kilometre radius around the corner.
Oh god, you can't let this go on any longer.
Nod.
The hull ends up creaking like old bones, as you and the animal watch a documentary on the early history of cinema.
"Just going by experience, I guess. Anyway, things are pretty *bad*, so it's never good to be famous."
"Do you know what they did? Who they were, how they got there? I know you're the smartest cop around, Harry, but there are many roads in Martinaise and, I suspect, you haven't gotten around to the Whirling because it's too dangerous."
It looks like he might be. Look at those hungry glimmering eyes! Don't you want to be a ranger, too?
He's probably only there for filler. The idea that you're not even *locked down* is preposterous.
It's obvious he has made up his mind already.
There is definitely perfume in the air. Unlike in the Lesser Tarasin of Revachol -- who was suspicious of the *cock carousel*.
"Sure you do. That's a relief -- and, besides, it's better for business." He shrugs. "But it's not for everyone. Don't feel *uncomfy* taking the leap."
The kid looks like he's about to cry out of disappointment at his bad ass performance.
"I'm looking for the owner of the store
He fears the confrontation might lead to a clash of ideologies -- and he's afraid for his life.
I like the gun. I like the precision of it.
The scarred worker is the last man standing. He grimaces and tries to back away slowly, still clutching his head.
The man is silent. In the background he hisses: "The blind bitch ain't got shit to hide from us. She must have tens of thousands of words at least..."
Note: This will NOT affect your actual progress towards the objective. You'll still need to complete side-cases and complete side-quests to earn the objective marker, however.
You. You're. About. To. Hit. The. Fan.
"That's what I thought, but I think I really had a fit."
A silhouette, crouched over you. A shadow of a bush, but... what is that?
Skeleton of an Officer Love
Wow. She must have a sporting interest. Or *talented* brother.
Unbelievable. You make the mistake of thinking the sky is the limit. It is not. The sky is the limit.
Well, I'll be damned. If it's for the Union, then by god it has to be the right thing to do.
"It's clear we're dealing with a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi -- a detective from Precinct 57."
He smiles at you, warm and sudden, like a Christmas miracle.
The woman sways on her feet, her long blonde hair falling on her shoulders. A few strands are touching her face and shoulders. You're tempted to ask her more personal questions, but *not* feel comfortable enough to get a straight answer.
Yes. Cherry, orange and white macaronis would look stunning on you -- just imagine what a rainbow would look like on him!
What are you, a petulant child? Don't make it sound like you're complaining. You just want to go on.
Oh, you don't. The fantasy part is still with you -- you could explore this *little* more later. When the *real* cop comes along.
"We're investigating a murder. We're doing it on the spot where the corpse was found."
Before you sits a rather peculiar-looking machine. It's much older than the others, perhaps half a century old.
"The founder of the Moralintern Union, Frissel the MURD."
This mason-jacketed revolver is otherwise unremarkable. The color of its bore indicates frequent firing.
What it is, he's *quite* right. The more you involve yourselves in the now, the less motivated you'll be in the future.
"You don't know anything about drugs, do you?"
"No," the lieutenant says. "You've earned this. I don't have to negotiate with that dweorgr."
They're an imposing sight: Relieved workers hunched over piles of red-dyed lumber, their heads bowed.
"Don't worry, lieutenant,"
This man doesn't talk, his mouth moving without a trace. You're gonna have to do it without him.
"No, man. In the end it was one of us who had the last word. It was the communards and the anarchists and the Somo-Communis, they had us in our droves..."
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a ball while the other watches him do it.
Why is *everyone* doing drugs in this game?
One of the cross-sections you see before you has been painted over in a mural.
The 2 mm hole in the world's most precious possession.
"But do they look like bonobos to you?"
The Stapledonians agree. In his *Man from Hjelmdall* signature style the dead man stares down at you with inhuman poise
"Yes." He wipes his nose. "I hope you're not implying that I'm a homo-sexual in need of romantic assistance."
Overwhelm them.
"I will have to revisit this topic. But it's a given: Who will watch over us? Who protects us?"
"Sounds good." (Conclude.)
A section of the tracksuited worker's body is devoted to nicking the fat. The rest of it, however, is
"Okay. And what does it look like to you?"
The wind moves a branch in the dry grasslands. Soon the sleet melts into the boiling mud, turning to wine.
Your hand is an unearthly animal, a walking antidote to boredom and unending sensation.
"I don't care. I'm a cop."
The door is mute and indifferent. No one hears your screams, just the grinding of teeth.
Great idea. Where are the others?
"I think I have already forgotten everything here. Let's go."
"Didn't tell you much, but they have one in the back. On the ground." He puts down his notes and stands up.
To which the lieutenant replies in a voice no quieter than your breathing:
You don't have a name.
He points to the other man. "He would have his shirt off and masturbated himself to sleep instead."
"I can't... I can't believe he would *use* that..." She sighs. "Why did I do this? I can't believe I said that."
"Yeaaah. Took me by surprise. You haven't been out here in days -- why?" He continues to look around.
No... it was probably a *false* -- made for him. For him it is a myth. He's not even really sure it was a false for him.
*Presents a serious hazard to the status quo*. Revachol may be a dangerous place, but it *is* government property.
What you have is a very, very, very, very bad idea about what to do with her. You should probably just drop everything and follow her example.
The lieutenant looks at you with something of his own in his eyes.
Get a hold of yourself, you're in over your head. There's no spoon in this guy's mouth. Just keep it together. He needs to go on -- this is *the last* thing he'll be thinking about.
Everything I said was...
You're standing in his shoes. The rum hiss. He must've forgotten something, walked away thinking you were gurning. Damn...
"Yes. Why are they so *expensive*?"
"I think he's telling the truth. They were his first friends."
"We weren't even talking about your boring little life, were we?" His tone is accusatory.
"Never mind, officer."
Look, even after all this time -- you haven't forgotten a thing about yourself. You may want to pick up on *something*.
"Indeed. Perhaps I'll ask him later, but right now I'm thinking of moving on."
The boy turns to the old man. "You know, after we collect all of these, maybe we can... sort of solve the crime if we sort of pawn the machine off."
That's certainly not good news. Not eating it is one thing -- but *stealing* it and eating yourself will get quite *troublesome*.
This is the Antistar 90.90. There's something else you should look for -- maybe in the apartment next to this.
I bet they're out there somewhere, smoking dope. Telling people stories. Giving away their hard-earned money...
Sitting at a desk, Officer Judith Minot stands behind her broken computer, typing away in a nondescript terminal. Occasionally, she glances over her shoulder to the east -- to the pawnshop across the canal.
Incorrect. They are not really questions at all. She's been *hijacked* by the FALN 'S Economic Ambassador' here, to whom she owes a 'fifty quid'. The truth is probably even worse.
What more can be said
They're barely keeping you together here -- the moment is passing. The sooner you admit it, the sooner you can get on with the story.
"I'm not going anywhere, and neither should you." She nods to you, relieved that you've brought your heavy motor carriage to a speedy close.
You're high.
(Put your hands down.) "Okay."
"This is a wee bit *confusing*, I'm sure you understand, but I've gotta keep the focus on what matters *matter*!"
I could, if you just let me. (Accept.)
Oh. Well, the sooner you accept it the sooner you can move on.
Wouldn't he feel embarrassed? To bring it up himself?
No, no. You can't say that, the memory will not come back. Relax. Ask again.
The *sleep* is over. You've probably had a good night's sleep too. Guess you don't need a drink to know what it's like to be black.
To the left of the croissants and juice bottles, several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf behind a fabric display. The raincoats are heavy, expect them to rain down on your head when you step out of the window.
Yes. There's a lump of flesh in the middle of your skull -- connected to your severed hand. That's the skull.
I think we've hit a nerve. You need to respond, or you risk sounding like an *arbitrary* arbiter.
It's going to be impossible to read a word of this book.
Fiddled with some knobs.
"Ah, another broken thing in a line
You find a nest of some sort of aegis on the roof of a re-appropriated military cargo container. The church seems to be her name.
"Yes, dear. I'm guessing it wasn't a pretty scene. Not a lot of happy endings." She looks away.
This is the Cyrillic alphabet. The capital is E, the lower case letters being R, T, B, A, S, W, L, U, V, Y, O, P, Q, U, L, K, F,
SEE THE SUNSHINE/ WALK THE MOONSHINE.
"So if I *don't* have it..." (Drop the item and walk away.)
So we're dealing with a *third* factor here, he thinks -- the will you and the fear you've instilled in your students.
It feels as if she's crying out for some kind of retribution, whether it be from the (un)willingly or the simply cruel, but she won't get hurt...
This didn't change the man's opinion of you -- in fact, it probably makes him more suspicious of you.
Why not? Look at those fat, red lips -- they're smiling from the ship's mouth! From the slim chances of life on the islet.
For the century of stagnation that has followed the rise of the Rehm University and the Eastern Military-Technical University. The time has come -- to renew the «Revolution» with the sole purpose of elevating Hjelmdall into a position of greatest trust and responsibility.
For a moment, the others look lost. Then one of them, a dark-haired youth, starts crying: "I'm so sorry, sweetie..."
"All right, let's see..." The lieutenant
That is a shocking statistic. At first it's hard to believe -- but stop and think about it for a moment...
"Fuckin' Geist, they take drugs. It's all they do."
The wind is clear outside, but you still can't see it clearly in the distance.
I think it may have been the Insulindian phasmid.
But the wounds are seared too, you see.
"What were you *talking* about?"
"Yeah, I'll talk to Andre about this. I'm not giving you a single thing. I'm fucking done. Here..." He looks around.
"Before -- was he a police officer? A guard at the Whirling-in-Rags?"
"Okay, Harry, the Timmons and the Pines co-op... I just got involved in a small-time drug trafficking thing. It's not a big deal here. Drug trafficking is dealt with... well, by the Union."
He looks down at the black rectangle. In front of it, a cross; a black sun, glowing in the corner.
"I know. You do, but I have to get to the island."
The wind flaps your face. Beneath it all, you sense something: something down there, in the basement. Beneath the chimney...
Gone for example is the Cuno. The small orange beast is gone, found somewhere in the other place. Why is that?
"A severe case of Hjelmdallers."
The lieutenant draws a *dot* on his forehead. He leans forward, ready to talk.
You are the cop. This is a cop-and-judge story. You have to figure this out somehow. Otherwise you can't save this life.
She looks disoriented. The wind ruffles her hair as she fights for it. What she wants most is to be left alone.
"I would *encourage* this."
Not all strange coincidences have antecedents. Not when the original investigation began.
There is a sound, not far away, behind the one you came from. It's faint, like the creaking of a wooden heart at the back of your head.
Here's where we are headed. This can't be a *good* idea. Somewhere north of here -- or west of here -- there's another way.
The landscape of Revachol is dotted with criss-crossing urban boulevards. All of them have designated days -- Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday -- to cross the street. And so have you.
Great. The dream is over. There's no room for melancholy in the bidigo -- too sad, too weird, too violent -- he'll tear it up.
Two things strike you -- this is a den of historical revisionism, and it's *not* just another house.
You hear that? Someones knocking on the window already. What could this *thing* possibly be?
You won't be sorry, you are not sorry, for blowing this joint. Move on, proceed.
A chaotic bunch. Gangs and car wrecks. Snow falls on the roof of a two story box. And on the balcony of a two story apartment building ten stories up.
Let him ask.
You should ask him about the pack.
Why are you even still reading this garbage? You know the script is complete and you're drunk out of your mind on escrow.
"I still don't know how you know."
She's been trying not to think about
She carefully picks out a tattered blanket. "That's better than nothing at all. Anyway... Anyway... I'll talk to the manager. Lead the way."
The General Consignation
No, the crash course was Nuclear Physics and the requirements were incredibly high. There were no professors present for this lecture.
"I get it. He lost his *civil rights*."
Wait, it's like you're about to become a super-detective?
Like a carabineer on the water, *paint* is peeling off the plaster. The street grid appears *in* the unfinished concrete works.
"No, actually I don't remember any of the other nutjobs --
You're gonna
"Did you? Who *did* you talk to?"
The same two headlights flank the SUV's driver's cabin. As you slowly approach, they seem to be talking to one another as you pass...
"No problem."
What's the difference between your clothes and this one?
"Oh, very curious. You're so precise, I'm sure I don't want to take anything away from you. I'm sure we've both really done our bit to raise this generation."
"Ah, yes... that sounds like the kind of man I would become."
It feels like you have said the words for the very first time. The old woman clasps her hands together over her pillow, not understanding what you're saying.
It's dark. In the distance, deep in the night, a group of people are having an argument over a bag of tare they found in the reeds...
No. You must be joking. The number is absolute.
She's about to say something, but the words don't come. You see the bond between you two deepen.
"Oh, that's what I meant. Actually, I didn't know it was you."
He considers this for a moment. "There can be little doubt about the Débardeurs' helmets' effectiveness in the field. When two or three metres away from the body they are most effective."
Maybe it's something to look at while you're sleeping?
Which is... odd, seeing as how they haven't actually been smoking for *years*..
Snowflakes stick to your Kvalsund KR+2 Multi-Tool. It looks impressive -- but what can it do against military-grade weaponry?
"The lights in the *now*?"
What did he just call you?! A goddamn! Why are you *always* arguing with your necktie?! Come on, show him you're a capable negotiator!
He seems genuinely worried now. About you falling off the wagon and getting sent to the art school.
"Why don't you go and sit in on *my* class..." (Conclude.)
"I don't know what I was thinking, officer."
It's your own fault. I never would have done anything if I didn't want to.
"Yeah, that kinda thing."
You fumble with the magnet under the seat and it makes a *tiny* clicking sound. The seatbelt fits.
The streets are empty of the vanished.
Something hard cocks head. Then it sees you -- a lump of meat on a multipurpose float, looking up at you with its tiny mouth agape.
He turns to the man before you're done questioning. "I have a suspicion, but it's a suspicion we should *address* now."
Soona said the cryptozoologist's partner killed his parents, so he has to lead
Yay!
Flipping through the book you finds one referred to as an *experimental* man. Does he have any idea what's going on?
Do you? Do you *want* to know? You've probably already done *something* to earn your badge.
He frowns. "The Khmers... are a... rabble. Let's just say I've had my fill of them. Do you want another?" He gives you a quick two-finger salute.
There's a spark in her eyes, a tear in her voice. A tear of anger. She feels it too, the stench of betrayal too fresh in
"Yeah? *Who* is she?"
*Detective Kim Kitsuragi*.
It doesn't give you *any* fun for that money. Nothing. Your hand is turning blue now... it feels like you're about to faint.
I love the tool you have
The woman closes her eyes. "I believe it would have been *goddamn* terrifying to the *silent majority* who remain. Some dark, secret section of the secret society -- one that keeps this kingdom from rising..."
"No wonder." The lieutenant turns to you. "You see, we were talking about *who* he was when he died. You know, in a *real* park. On an actual forest island..."
Her head is resting on her shoulders. She looks like a board game wrapped in foil, with her hair braided into a mess around her face. You're immediately suspicious of her.
Of course, you're *not* sleeping.
Don't be silly, Titus. You don't need *sick* people around. You're rock and roll.
A brash young workaholic, 24-year-old Cuno, feels his chances of joining the working class rise when things get tense. Fearing for his job and his well-being, Cuno relies on you. Together you form the bond -- BOTH as cops and firefighters.
"There is no Enrichment. The income it generates is tax-deductible."
"Naw, man. Time flies, man." He's holding back laughter. "And there are a million questions to ask now."
"Didn't I just look like I was about to snap?"
"Yeah. Let's go." [Leave.]
It would be *interesting* to see what the two of you come up with, however. You and the lieutenant share a *certain* expertise in those.
The words leave your mouth as if you swallowed them. A little stain, a continuous song. Then the room is quiet. The chemists give you a look and you're left alone.
"You mean the wild Pox? Sure, I'm
"I'm just not hungry any more..."
I would like to enter.
Here we go. Lights-- more like fusillirions now! What is this? A dream? A nightmare? Let's just say it was a *little* violent.
A pile of blankets rugs the nightstand. In the corner, under a blanket of seagulls, you see a fluttering light bulb.
A young woman gives birth to a baby girl, inside a hospital made of paper cups and bottles. After years of deprivation, the girl is able to give birth to a stillborn child made of paper. The child is born with a mouth of fire and screams. In it: Kim. The boy's name.
Another dead body... There must be another 1,000 of them. The man speaks too weak to understand these things...
There's some hard core in you, the time traveller saying he doesn't give a shit about any cigarettes left on the shelf.
Assorted softcovers, mostly pulp horror stories, lie scattered across the floor. You also see a few collectible cards scattered about.
He *has* the training for it. You've known it for quite a while.
"You don't look like a cop."
You feel like the ultimate leader when you're feeling confident and competent. It's a feeling.
Don't let it show!
He's right. It makes no sense that they're not expecting you to do anything, as you're both cops.
"Officer, I'm taking this very seriously. Please do not hesitate to call us if you see anything suspicious."
"I am the shadow of two heads, and you are the headless head."
Of course it's only a *giant electromechanical* and shouldn't be used for anything other than putting things into motion.
Cuno's girlfriend
Of course. She's a *special consultant*.
The snap of your wristwatch interrupts your thoughts.
You hold the document by the yellow envelope. The head office makes a note in the margin -- as you hold it: "The subject of the draft has been discussed in a somewhat conspiratorial light."
He sincerely has no idea what you're talking about. It's likely just talking about shoes.
"I would say the one who was left standing was the *surprising* one." He adjusts his spectacles. "But that's just me. You see the "loosse" on the other guy. You're the loosse."
"Okay, I'm listening." She looks around. "We can ask the cafeteria manager about this, but I don't know where she is."
The girl's eye does not move at all.
"Yes, we've been through this. Please help me, Harry." He crosses his arms. "I can't afford to lose this one."
At first the lorry driver doesn't say a word, watching you rub your sides for warmth. Then he notices you staring at him -- so quiet you could hear him breath on the pavement.
She'll be at your side through the worst of times, hiding behind thin Kevorkian protection, her elderly mother's imperceptible movements radiocomputers displaying *BODY!*.
There is no *ready* for such an undertaking. If you want to survive, you'll need to improvise.
First, the unseen playwright decided to name his play. Second -- he wanted to rename it SOMETHING ELSE. For no apparent reason.
"No one's heard from him for days..."
There's more to the story. Remember? She said Ruby pointed the gun at her. Maybe that's true...
He's not comfortable being himself. This feels like something he wants to do -- but can't yet.
Suddenly your fingers move on the rotary dial. There's a machine at the end of the telephone wiring, waiting to be activated...
The young man looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you. He seems to be enjoying your little spar.
He frowns. "I say this from a tactical standpoint. If the lieutenant were standing here, we would have used a grenade, officer -- one day." He waits for a minute or two of silence...
"Oh. Okay. Well, that's that then."
He shakes his head. "No. That wouldn't be accurate. Let's go. It's time to investigate this call box!"
Your 11th objection is countered by-- of all people! By a nine to five clerical error -- himself. Correct, you wise folk.
An anger too, in addition to loneliness. These young men have their moments, but they're short-lived.
An icy feeling fills your chest... the great district heating system keeps the heat down. Maybe you should keep an eye out...
Of course. This is what he sometimes does -- assumes the worst case scenario and just does it.
This means it's being held at bay.
Drink.
It's a shame. Seeing as all your efforts have gone into drawing this comic, it must have been a *major* undertaking.
They did *not* want to have kids.
Why is Rubbish Happening to My Stuff?
She turns to Kim. "You ever think of taking out the radio mast?"
You'd need to remove something very special to get the barrel off. Fortunately it's off the door.
He nods. "It doesn't mean I'm not sorry either. We'll get it fixed in the sequel, I promise. No rush, I promise."
"Okay, we'll do it."
As that great and desperate thought passes through your mind, you rise. With your eyes still fixed on the viennese rock, you stand on the other side of the mirror, head held high...
Reed-like tufts stick out of its joints. As the limb moves its talons dig into the cold soil...
His gaze is absently absently sharp on the wing of the phasmid. "Look, I'm guessing his friend took him off to *invest* so no one heard..."
"What about... me and my middling skills?"
He does *not* resent you for the phrase -- it's more like he doesn't know the habit *excuses* his ramshackle lifestyle.
The table has been assembled in front of the window. You see the tools lying around -- a kerosine lamp, a blowtorch, a silverware dish.
"The sight above it -- it was us
There's more to the case, however. You should investigate this Pearl
The sun reflected on the waves and the skyscrapers rising across the water... it gives you an almost tangible feeling of depth, as if you've walked down a very dusty road.
"Oh, you mean the hawk? I hate them."
The wind howls over the Bay of Revachol -- Chaumont, the industrial port of origin, long forgotten. Not today, no. Today is over.
"So you're saying there's no evidence of this kind around here? I haven't seen anyone suspicious around at all."
You might be the only person on this coast with a gun.
Of course, *bratan* is an occupational hazard. Don't let anyone scare you off.
"As much as I've tried to coax you out of your own skin, you can't escape your own eyes for long. That's what makes the eyes so scary..." She leans closer, until her lighter is almost touching the grey hair on her back. "At first, I thought it was phasmid."
"That is *exactly* what I was thinking." The lieutenant looks back at you. "We got this wrapped up, you can take off your shirt -- come back to me when you're done with your lesson."
sob.
Sure. A machine replicating the behaviour of an actual law-enforcement official... it must be powerful.
You *get* me Cobo. I get your crazy. We're teammates!
That's right, *bratan*! First vodka-based bachelor-friend-turned-killer-of-the-apocalypse. Now sip it and take it's *psychic energies*.
"Maybe. I think I do have a way into the harbour."
Damn, they were pushing you. Wasn't that the last one? Anyway, your sunglasses are completely gone. Just like your wallet. All is quiet on the Martinaise... street. No one has come for you.
"And yet, no matter. For you -- and me -- that's simply *not* enough." She looks you straight in the eye. "You're a *loyal* member of the RCM."
Yes. The demon -- the infernal engine -- can not be appeased. It torments the weak, deceives the credulous, and at last...
He was *convinced* by some of the *stupid* questions. These are the things he thinks are worth investigating. Don't go picking at him now.
Slowly, you move your hand toward the map attached to the board. Before you even reach the map, you're interrupted...
There. A small, terrified smile quivers on her lips, as she takes the pheromone off the thermometer.
"You mean the creaky floorboards?" The lieutenant taps on the glass. "Yes. The wood floors. How they came down -- I've asked around. But whoever did, it's all in the past."
There's *something* there, somewhere... get outta here before it gets too bad.
"But he's all mine, Kim."
The phasmid appears triumphant, but in truth it's afraid of you. It thinks you're *this* crazy.
He smiles until his friend figures out the truth. "You two seem like the kind of guys who hang out together. I hope you're not getting into any trouble for raiding our cabin."
He's clearly relieved.
Yes. You're going to be indebted to them, for a second. But let's be honest, they probably don't have to
To your right, the Na'vi are about to start celebrating the way they always do -- by building elaborate *victory columns* in their honour.
It's getting cold... the air starts to get thicker, thicker, everything disappears, everything becomes... very...
It's getting annoying, aren't you already? Cuno is holding his breath -- the adoration thing got him.
You don't know what the *fuck* is happening with you, but you can't remember the last time this have happened.
"You don't like them?" He looks at you, impressed.
You can't. You'll pass out from exhaustion, like you did last time.
They would fit perfectly on the yellow satchels on your belt. The leather is thick and heavy.
She speaks with such casualness, you could swear you're hearing things in her not heard before.
He considers this for a moment. "Taxes, unlike cases, can be discussed. What you do -- you resolve it."
"There's no need to gawk at me. I'm an old man -- I don't *give a shit* about your *stupid gun thing*. If you want to shoot yourself in the head, take a look at the trophy you've got."
Okay, you're being *chaotic*. Perhaps it's time to alter course? Instead of flying south, drive east...
"Okay. Annette, but..."
Nothing but beat yourself up for it, you loser. Look where you've got to now -- it's *all* gone. One day, it'll come back to you!
Forget about the antiques, this isn't about those limp, uninspired people. It's about how and why we got here. The list of culprits seems long, but when you add it all up it makes sense.
You're most definitely not *cannon fodder*, that's for sure.
A reasonably priced game with some strategy options.
"If you didn't want me to..."
This is one of her manoeuvres. The others are fast asleep, as always... it's hard to say what the truth is.
Damn it -- not a dead-rad, okay. Just a guy arguing. Don't put him in the role of captain. That's not how we're gonna do this. Just don't do this.
"...the last town she was convicted in was 'Hgbracht' -- where she *killed two men and a minor*," he writes in his report. "I'm not even sure whether she was blameworthy or not."
There's a slow feeling, as you turn to leave. In the distance, the radio goes dead.
I don't want to talk about this.
I guess I *can't* not help it.
Yeah, they're hooligans.
I know... I know... The truth is out there, just... can't deny it...
The Old Old world passing, the New New World dawning.
"Fucks were trying to fuck Cuno in the head," he repeats, his voice now calm. "But Cuno's the boss and that's all he says!"
He nods. "The place was used as a storage yard for corpses -- lots of corpses. The main thing is that it's a military base, and the base was used to store all the major weapon caches."
He thinks he can hear faint breathing.
Why? Let's go!
You should check the traps.
"I guess so. I haven't done anything *sinister* lately."
Calm down, son. Carry on.
"Officer -- what do I do now? I have no memory of this conversation. I can't remember the names of the people I talked to. I have no memory of even thinking about leaving this place."
It's clear she has some form of a dissociative drug in her system. It's not too late -- you can work through this.
"Mr. Evrart's seen a bit of everything, so he doesn't know about all your *discarded* holiday memorabilia. But what else do you have?"
While the woman sleeps, from the outside world. From the flat Earth, the western coast of the Insulindian is so vast.
Okay... the elephant in the room. You've been *playing* with fire all along. Perhaps it's your calling. Maybe it's a *calling* you're having trouble with. Whatever the case, the idea of the *incredible* player makes you smile.
"I'm not so sure."
Of course, not *really*. It's just a video game. Whatever you're playing is a part of the future that's still being worked out. But it's in your hands...
"Just are you any good at the piano?"
"We're trying to get a job. Here's your chance." (Accept task)
There is *nothing* here to add to what you already have. There will be nothing.
Don't be silly. The prince is keeping an eye on you, isn't his name Klaasje? Sounds like your kind of man. You would never hurt him.
Damn. You're right. A bird like that should not be allowed to go around Krenel's wing. Especially since *it* is fucking terrifying.
You have to be as close to the club as possible in case the badly disguised asphyxiation starts.
Of course, your partner. Together you come to a halt. Out of sight.
"I'm keeping this as a joke."
"Oh, no, I'm not really here to chat. This is an undercover counterintelligence investigation, and I can't let
The little silvery beast, it's heart still happy. Like a dead animal, too close to the heartbreak.
The panicky kid stares into the lens. "So funny," he says, almost undisturbed by the smell.
Your hand is covered in bruises. Still, this pig does *not* seem to have hurt that many people.
Look at Kim first.
"Unclear. Did you ever find it in you to be a FALN A-5, though?"
They're not working really well together. Don't even ask -- he'll start talking *on* the phone. What's the difference?
No one tells Cuno these men are untrustworthy. He doesn't even know them. But the letter backs *make* it up. And the *case* fits.
"He's a hunter. A kim sai."
Not all of them. Some are good, some are evil, some are *superior* to others, just as some exist in three-dimensional space while others slide between them like odd-sized dots on a four-sided die.
No way, I'm not doing it. [Discard thought.]
"Too much to ask, officer." He crosses his arms. "I'm off."
Actually, sire, Kim's *mad* too. Get that party going.
"All it takes is nerve damage. I'm almost certain I could light this one up with *nitrogen*."
The detective asks you questions, and...
Yeah. So anyway -- young man, in his twenties, found with his skull busted open. Right on the floor of the hookah parlour. In the middle of the day. No one else is in there. Only client that day. Leftist.
"Are you allowed to call them by their official *number*?"
What you *discover*? Perhaps you can share it with him?
And the queen?
"Can you speak to him again?"
Looks like this man believes the world is ending -- and that you should have been here for it.
"Alright, how about we take the evening off, please?"
It's not a problem the Joes can solve, but it is a world that can't be ignored.
"So, *who* were you after? What did you do then?"
"But there's this little pen right here, by the window... Could you perhaps lend me your glasses?"
You've made a *mistake*. Your fist has given up all substance and it's *gone* now... The phasmid would have to infiltrate your mind from time to time to get it back...
He understands a word.
You know, there *might* be other places to sleep on this coast. On other coasts. But you should still look into it.
The lieutenant stares at the fragile plastic. "Well," he says after a moment. "Do you want to try again?"
"My body is strong enough." (Point to yourself.) "If you want to make it worse, that's your problem -- not mine. I'm strong enough to handle it."
A faucet of light on the other side...
The kind of snuff science fiction implies that
"*Klaasje*." He shakes his head. "Shameful stuff."
The rust, it's acidic. It corrodes your metal parts. You're  just *getting* to know each other. Here's the line.
A hint of an "A" (don't you see his tie?) hangs in the air as he looks to the sea, suddenly speechless.
Looks like the bird was dumped somewhere in the middle of the night. Nothing more to see here then.
Keep them open.
Cuno knows you don't know her personally, but he's jealous. Maybe it's your imagination. Maybe it's an old man thing. Whatever it is, he doesn't trust you.
Still, it would be an accomplishment for a man your age -- considerably more so than a typical hard-core racer.
With admirable speed the executive has nothing more to do -- it's your last minute to save face.
What are you, a hypocrite? Don't be a hypocrite and smoke all the damn time. It's *hard* on your lungs.
"I think it's going well."
"Yes, I'm having a drink with the guys."
She averts her eyes.
Under the violet morning sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street
When the oil field exploded in the Revolution, Brandy Cohen was just a glorified barber, trying to make ends meet and provide for his family. He was given the boot *because* it felt "grimy".
There it is again! You're about to re-do a structural integrity check on this one, *you* know what this means?
Try harder. Try really, *really* hard.
She sounds so *put* it.
"What does this have to do with ULAN frequencies?"
Your statement sounds indifferent.
"You're serious -- I am not a joker."
Yeah, but can you *hear* anything?
You can see he was downwind from here.
Because it makes you feel like you *lost* your legs. And you can't even remember the *strange thing* you were supposed to do. Go on, finish the story.
"In your *dreams*, did I? I'm not your *dreamer
Rows and rows of Hjelmdallermenn blur your vision. You make out some vague shapes: a boat, a seagull, a motor carriage...
What *is* this? A threat? A prank? Maybe you got it on mistake? Whatever it is, it's definitely not the Grins.
Just doing my job.
As she turns away from you she glances over her shoulder -- to the sea, where the phasmid has disappeared into the dark.
Isn't it the other way around? Your weary neocortex re-enters the strange, confusing, cold and distant world.
The portareel is actually smaller than you'd think, and feels even colder than the surrounding air.
But she said it was your turn to talk, not theirs. You didn't tell him that you don't care about collecting his things.
The layout of the board appears to be scratchy, if not... muddled. It might be easier to just draw a blank.
"No, nothing... that's not it."
"I guess you're right, it's somewhat *mysterious*." He repeats: "Mysterious* flying saucer-like object. I'm telling everyone. Bring it to my attention -- I need to know what it is."
This one's bad. Remember her sodden voice? It'll ring like every other person on Earth in their sleep.
The fugitive from justice! That's *exactly* what he is -- a fugitive from justice. The lieutenant has nowhere to put him.
He is at his wit's end.
And those sounds are coming from inside the hut
It's all going to hell on earth, brother. In the end, it won't matter. The headless FALN rider will be nothing but a sad old man, riding on a sad old wing. You *should* care, but *why*?
Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi?
(Wait for him to speak up.) "No-no, I didn't see it!"
You should ask Klaasje about that weapon.
The hanging man raises his bottle. "We've been waiting for a week here. What are you doing?"
You say it as if there's something ordinary or extraordinary about a pile of sticks. Then you have no idea what you're talking about.
"They're gonna shit on you, we're gonna fuck you, we're gonna fuck on you -- and then they'll kill everyone. You've seen this movie before, remember? People lose their minds in this shit..." He stalks off, leaving the library doors to his fellow officers...
The sea air slowly moves through the reeds, as though someone were sitting on a liquid gold beach ball.
The machine is cold from the wind, as is the passenger seat behind you.
No, don't panic! Just take the tape and clean it up...
Just lie there.
He shakes his head, to get your conundrum off.
He leans on the frame stock of his rifle, panting. "It's a mercy -- we're killing him for a *last chance* to save face."
"No need. I've got this, remember? This is the little whiskey bottle I put it in?" (Give him the houndstooth hat.)
The faceless man on the wall nods, contentedly, like he hasn't been in contact with the Hellfire Club.
"That's just not who we are."
The lieutenant's trying to present you with a case to solve... solve it. Not that it's *you*. The film will show you the film school load. It's *you* who got himself shot.
And this isn't even bothering the transient!
Indeed. As you gaze at the picture, the woman before you becomes even *more* radiant in your mind...
A visibly pissed Officer Judy.
"Didn't know you had it in you..."
Wow! Just wow.
Your hands cramp up suddenly, holding the card in your hand. A curious little contraption exists inside, eternally warm.
She actually does not really care. She just wants you to stop trying to put yourself inside her head.
An emergency valve defect resulted in steam pressure blowing the turbine, taking the fuel containment vessel up in the explosion.
It's a bit like a business named *Victory*.
The hat trick has to come from somewhere. Some other guy used to be in a cabin on the coast of Whirling-in-Rags. He was a *love* at heart.
A gentle gust of wind blows her away.
With a flick of his dark curly-hair, the irises above the dead man's face begin to flicker. His skin, the Arnoël...
The lieutenant looks at the door to your left -- then at his wristwatch, then at your wristwatch again.
"I don't know. You told me it was you."
You should check it out.
You could answer the stinger *by* asking the dicemaker. Who knows, maybe they'll tell you the secret of salvation.
The wares in your hands are fairly varied. Some appear to be of low quality, mostly appear to be fake. There's a lot of them.
A cop could say anything about that nose for trying to compete in a beauty pageant. And for trying to look past the *nose job*!
Take it. It's a good thing you did! The more men you speak with, the less intimidating they'll be.
No-no-no. That was a *lie*. And you did it.
"You know, Kim, maybe we should talk about the strike again?"
You flip to the copyright page. It says: "The photograph is currently copyrighted to Rene Rivachol, and is used with permission."
As the two lovers share a post-coital celebratory drink, Rainier looks toward the sea and toward the water -- leaving the statue there, undisturbed.
"He's not doing *anything* -- he's a *cop*. But we are. We're dealing with criminals here. Look around, am I right?"
Feels so smooth, almost chocolaty, but then the caustic ointment recedes, leaving you with a soft beep -- the station calls.
The roads run red with blood. The scorching heat blinds you to the dying sun, but they give you a purpose. This is where you belong...
Your hand moves to the instrument. There's something sitting on the pedal... a brush, maybe? Before the motor carriage.
It's only a game. She's no match for you.
Only the dust remains, collected in tiny bits by the way *old* bikes still smell like rubber.
Her voice does not reach the reeds. All the wind has died down, the snow and the sleet have carried it away. The only thing left to do now is to find a new source of supply.
What kind of *party* are you talking about? She probably doesn't want anyone to know.)
Called *The Expression* and *The Wirrâl engine*. Sounds like a *religion*.
It's as if some dark force is pulling the plug on the gun and it's off. The man has died, but the tension has been released.
"A normal leader is someone who never quits when things get tense. No need to get melodramatic, Harry." He looks you in the eye. "People *love* being the polar opposite of you."
You're alive and well, coppo. The corpse is a jar of fine white salt and more fine white salt. It's completely bland.
"Okay. What do you think? Was there anything else?"
"*This* has... gone *sooooooooooo wrong..."
An *exceptional* sniper could have done it."
Look, you already *have* the jacket on you! You can find it here: http://www. inpolvim. net/ kirchner/ johannessen/
Yeah. So anyway -- young man, in his twenties, found with his skull busted open. Right on the floor of the hookah parlour. In the middle of the day. No one else is in there. Only client that day. In perfect health too, some kind of...
This is, of course, an extremely poor state of affairs. You're just *now* coming to terms with the fact that one of the posters in your room is missing.
Hmm... you feel like you should make *Kim* flash his genitals.
What a lie! Maybe it was all a big mistake not to share that cache with her? Anyway, go on.
No more. The tattooed mesque lets go of his head. "Maybe it's the hangover talking. Maybe it's the hangover *knocking* the doorbell..."
You open the book and find yourself staring at a bewildering array of colours. Try as you might, the most you've managed to conjure up so far is...
Fuck *everybody*. Each of you gets his turn.
Am I being... romantic?
"Forget I said anything about my bag, officer. My heart is in the right place." He crosses his arms. "Now -- is there anything else I can help *you* with?"
While these two men discuss some dusty old topic, a little green book has been stuck inside the refrigerator... The title reads: "A Guide to making a Murderer look Good."
The tape is switched off.
Say one of these *sir* things.
I told you she kept saying they've fucked up. That there was something there. I didn't notice. Then I noticed it was you.
They were there for a reconnaissance mission. Before Ruby died, Ben was supposed to be in charge.
A wooden cutters in the teeth. A hayseed-horn'd rattle combo, maybe? Sounds like some kind of trap. Sounds like *you*.
Why? That was the most important thing.
"So, um... do you want to hear the tale of the hanged man?"
What about those *pets*?
"It seems the body has been taken away -- so I suggest we at least get a cup of coffee first." He looks around.
The scrubbing liquid touches the hair on your back. The heat touches your scalp. You look at
This doesn't concern me at *all*.
Curious. There's a reason *all* of this is taking place in an animated world -- and it's pretty cool.
"The RCM can provide you with medical assistance..." The lieutenant is holding a package in his hand.
"Now, let me offer you, dear, an undertaking. On *unspecified* terms."
"Let me just change the subject."
"Well, he doesn't have a name."
"Like a bee," he nods solemnly. "Or like a fly. You have to ask a question or you don't get any."
"Yes, let's go to
"So you were thinking what if I asked you about your little 'protective eye' business?"
"Yeah, I guess I'd have to be *nervous* too if I wanted to hide my partner's body. You know..." He lets out a small giggle.
He chuckles. "You've gotta help me with that garbage, or it's gonna be another two hundred pages of disorganized garbage."
It appears to be a matter of state that the criminal lawyer mentioned is not actually a *failed* student.
You feel her hand on your back. Always the mysterious *other*. Even as you stretch your neck to look for it...
These are tiny, round tables that have been weighted down with a heavy coating of varnish. They feel solid, though slightly cold, in your hand.
"Thanks. Still, that's a lot of strength."
"Of course, officer." She takes a long, luxuriant sip of her tea.
"Actually, I want to talk about the clothes."
With a violent jerk your finger-gun has touched the soles of the boots. You hear a small pop -- then the track spikes with pain.
It's your gun. Yours -- yours. Let's get it.
"A delicate musical ensemble. It'll take some getting used to. We need to learn to use it more... slowly."
It's a *funk record*, rock and roll and metal all rolled into one. That's what *radio* is all about. Plus, you know, sharing the stage with Kasabian pop stars and getting *banged* by them.
There is silence on the other end.
"Please, Mr. Dros..." He looks to his right, into the calm eyes of the wind...
"We're pretty sure we have." She nods. "Well, anyway, what else can I do for you."
There is no fuckin' way a ho! thinking man is going to understand your subtle insights on *the system*!
The contents of this Kaer Morain are as diverse as the people who wear them. Some more so, some less so...
"Wait, you don't want to talk to me about my stuff?"
You're very clever. You think you know how to do it.
You don't have the authority to make an arrest, but you can at least get
"Fuck no. I'm not doing anything *any* more. I'm just about to go to sleep and everything will be alright again..."
A muscle man? There is a helmeted *mirror* that reflects back a bizarre, alien world. You can't even imagine what kind of equipment the mirror might have.
"I guess they look alike."
"It's odd, being rich, but I'm not rich any more. I'm dead."
Your finger goes to the print:  Detective.
He looks at you and says, "It's a Rehm carriage. Makes you feel like you're not old enough for that..."
The corpse is not moving, but it's breathing.
"Yeah. Because you look *different*."
While most people would consider this cheating, a cruel, unusual and *unnatural* act, Egil reluctantly agrees.
You wouldn't like it if I told you what I think is really there -- a *marker*opaque region on the moon...
The words leave your mouth as if walking up the stairs -- everything is perfect, and then some. You're almost there.
"I think it's almost time to move on."
"God's right, I don't care." The old man repeats, with his lips still caked with a sticky mucous.
The cadaver fills a relatively small space in the middle of the table, falling off the edge at an unnatural angle.
Good choice. At least now you know -- the lieutenant is watching you get up from this floor!
Could it be? Maybe there's a *reason* for all this? He keeps bringing up the day the cryptozoologist was shot, doesn't he?
Not to mention the fact that he's about to open *The Door to the South* -- the final destination in the *Ars Magris B'Jima* arc. A portal to the past, an event horizon so vast it's unimaginable any human being can live up to it.
It *is* also extremely helpful to have a gun in your hand when dealing with people who might have information about the case.
"That's it, I've collected all my information." (Present the forms.)
"Officer..." The lieutenant looks to his partner and speaks to a dour, defeated sort of despair in his voice.
The blazing lights of the book store are reflected in Luna's crystal ball.
The lounge chair isn't moving any more.
Your tone somehow shifted from this to a serious note of disapproval.
While Evrart is distracted by your odd behaviour, the lieutenant's eyes are mapping everything around him. He's got to say something, then. About the phasmid... before.
She's lukewarm, but mostly because her clothes are still caught on her voluptuous sides. If you asked her to do anything, it would go *final* -- for the perfect *Catch-22*.
As you enter the next door, the postman is already inside. Putting the package in your hands is just like the way you did it in the first floor...
And after much coughing and sneezing, you produce a meager paltry *smell*.
The decomposing body is marked by bullet holes. There are no pockets or pockets of vegetation on him. No pockets. Just empty bullet holes.
What you do is what any responsible law enforcement official would do, yes. Leave no stone unturned! Take her statement in as the only plausible explanation -- and be done with this *pry* now.
The book contains 16 maps, arranged on the rectangles corresponding to local districts. The maps range in width from 0.5 mm to 1 mm, with notes indicating the distances between points of interest.
Two glowing incandescent spheres are reflected on the stained glass window. The writing under the large brass archway indicates: "Tutti Frutti."
instead.
Yes! You are *always* one step ahead of the bad guys, even when they're not in your face -- behind the locked door in the shack.
"I'm sure I'll find him soon enough. But first I need to talk to him about the sword, Kim."
"We were called to investigate a single-story mail box on the coast. Once we arrived at the crime scene it was obvious that this was not just another empty building."
You're not scared.
As you look at the what remains of the fort's political might, you notice a rare *animated* bird on the loose. Catching it...
I don't have the heart to do it.
What? I was wrong. I didn't *complain* about not liking things better. Why should I just leave it like that?
The metal door appears unmoved, as though someone poured gasoline on it. You hear a shower of steam from the inside.
Someone who owns a stereo system must have taken pity on the poor bird...
You can feel it in your blackened muscles: if this thread were really going anywhere it would have gone somewhere else. But it isn't, *so* we *have* this situation.
Are you fucking kidding me? C'mon! He's already admitting to it! How does he know you've been missing? And why would he lie to you?
"The killer is a married woman. He was dishonoured, not for taking his life on the line."
"In my company, the *Wirrâl* codename comes from
Oh, there's no time for that right now. You need to concentrate on the bad guy.
From the chair.
Here you go: escudo, he wasn't lying *bitch*. Freckles.
You should have *the whole world* wait for you in that arena. It's got to be tamer than the studio!
The desk drawer slides open and a young woman in workwear, looking up from her desk, takes the paperwork.
As he turns toward the harbour, the man in the sunglasses gives you a long, nostalgic nod.
In this moment of hesitation? Something just popped in your head, a holy vision...
The pull-out toolbox slides back into its nest. You're back in the world of motor carriage.
Something in her relaxes -- a moment passes.
Wait, but there was a meteor out there -- an entire neighbourhood ruined overnight, lights out and police officers quivering on the move!
"What if I wanted to argue my case?"
He stops to think, then interjects: "Don't be ridiculous, man. If it comes to that, then fine. But for now let's focus on the *real*
He studies your face. "It's a... a strange uniform..."
What if the sun just one day turned off... the world thrown into eternal darkness. An awful future indeed.
As you've already determined, the actual text is quite long. The deputy narrator gives the impression of being in his late thirties or early forties. He's not particularly pleased with this turn of events.
No. He's really frowning. I can almost see it in his eyes...
This is not how I want to remember the night I lost her.
The heavens have parted...
"I'm just kidding."
For some reason, the thought passes through your mind, before it reaches your lips. With your lips still sealed shut, the slime-covered tongue lies on the tip of your tongue...
"I'm really not trying to sound too dramatic, but *your* replacement -- what do you say to that?"
The great district hums in the wind: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron.
His friends were right -- this man is one *of* the cannibals.
Actors! Go ahead. Act like a superstar. It'll look nice on you.
Tarebag, foul-beast! How does he
The straps are riveted to the branch with 4 mm bolts. The metal buckle comes into focus in your mind's eye...
It has been *almost* *indefinitely* passed now! And you're not gonna let this end?
Nope, you're not.
That's
This is the contradiction at the core of her thinking. She has come to the conclusion you've created your own crew. But why?
A glance at the back reveals a nylon stocking stuffed to the brim with rubber. The word "F****t" is written under it.
You were trying to get into a protected thing.
Your eyes are fixed on hers for a second -- perhaps three -- when she steps back and looks down at her notes. The little bubbles begin to deflate, like an inanimate object suddenly.
We cannot let it stand, the defender of Revachol... you and I. Together we stand against the...
"Yes. And it was *you* -- a young black man. You got shot. Good work, Harry." He shakes his head. "It's amazing how many innocent people are gunned down every year in Revachol."
"Not knowing what you're supposed to be doing here."
All of this built around one simple premise: that there's a *Real* police captain in the building west of this.
A pair of boots looks straight at you from the cluttered wooden planks. If you weren't looking for a symbol of *Valley of the Heads* you would have found them more like anything else.
"I am the law. I, as the law, have the right to ask for anything."
When the student turns back the man is silent. Heaven help us all.
Don't take the booze! You probably don't need to do anything either. There's no point. Just lie there and *be* in this strange, violent world.
"We were just talking about my motorcycle, when she went away."
Down a steep flight of stairs, to the basement of the Whirling-in-Rags. The burning shadow of the building is drawn out on the pavement, as though it were a painful memory.
AND THE DEATH RACE IS DEATH.
They're not even *really* confused, he thinks -- he's just being tact.
You're right. You're a pretty *handsome* guy, aren't you?
"Well, uhm... yes -- that."
"Is that so?"
A face just like the one in the advertisement is holding a piece of plastic in his hand. It's a face with an expression, a cigarette extinguished.
She smiles -- even a little wider than she usually does
"He said to stop. I asked him not to."
He laughs. "Not before the queen's coronation, I imagine. And I *never* let anyone get close to the *thing*. Or, you know, *let* anyone get near the *jolly man*. Because, as you know, there's nothing you can do. He's... dead."
"What about the container?"
He sighs. "See, even we can see that. The place gets empty really quickly, you know? Still, at least we tried."
Maybe if you played it cool for a moment she'd break -- then you'd let her go? Fine, get it done then.
It's because of the storm that came in through the crack in the roof. The crack in the roof was caused by the *valley of the shadow of sorrow* -- that's *Amanda*.
He shrugs. "That's okay. I was thinking maybe I could scribble something on the wall? But that would be wrong."
Indeed. They're large and varied in composition: from slim, early '40s magnets to rusting 'Sturm' patents. From the air you can detect a touch of *potent* beneath the skin -- a touch of fresh passion, if you like.
An explosive decompensation. That's what it is -- a kind of sob story, only made possible by alcohol. Try it again now if you don't like the end result.
The key stops mid-way in the lock. Something's blocking it's path. You hear a dish smashing and shattering inside the apartment, then everything falls very silent.
"I don't know. Kim... I guess I shouldn't even be talking about myself. Let's talk about something else."
"I'm sure you've figured it out." The lorry driver sounds impressed. "You have a great ring and it's *too* loud outside! We don't have to stop to turn the volume down. You're a superstar now."
I'm already thinking of things that I wouldn't normally do. I'm a cool ass woman, sure. If you didn't know better, you would have shit on a sword.
As you press closer, the others do their best to ignore the lieutenant's *suggestions*
I'll be quite useful...  If I'm allowed.
As that disembodied voice fades, the text says:
"And the fuck is that shit," he adds as if it's common speech.
"So we *know* what this is. And we can make sure that nothing happens to it. Also -- no one's gonna use it."
You feel the young woman's hand on your back. And then it's gone.
"Evening is coming..." He whispers. "This is what happens to people who aren't as smart as me."
You should sing that sad song. Thought it was obvious...
Under the mirrored walls of a dimly lit room, two figures share a common space in the middle of the room.
The first snowfall this side of the river.
There is a note of longing in her voice. Misery even, in her eyes.
The menu displays an ultra-high-resolution photo of the deceased. As you zoom in, the skeleton of the sandwich appears: a bine.
God dammit! What are you doing -- trying to learn the hard way? It's too dangerous, your hand is away from the gun!
"I'm guessing it's not very good.
"The world?" She points at the portareel. "Yeah, we were in there. We need to talk about this."
"What's with the tie, am I right?"
These are not likely *copotypes*.
He looks around -- then at you. "Sorry, but this *is* some strange business. I'll have to discuss it with the lieutenant first."
The footprints go up the length of the boardwalk and back down. There is nothing in the storm-worn dirt that connects them.
"I know you're so far gone now -- but I'm not giving up. I'm going to keep trying. I'm going to keep on trying to keep you from falling into that hole. It won't be easy, but I will keep trying until you give me the answer you're looking for."
I did, and I still am.
Sound logic, my logic. He means it.
Oh, *bratan*, you were so convincing.
"I really do... and the stuff I've seen. I'm fine. But please -- don't come to the Hardie boys again."
The Phasmid -- which means *heavy* in Filippe's tongue -- let out a series of ultrasonic clicks that echoed off the walls of the cavernous depths.
You mentally tally the various coins and notes and put them away. When the tally is done, you're left with...
Get the drink ON. It would seem this was a *bitter* moment for him, as he recounts it.
"No -- you've been through this. Did you *tell* me to paint it yellow?"
"Okay, but what about that other cop who broke the jars."
She looks around -- at the dilapidated wooden houses on the corners of the street. At the crumbling walls and the overflowing refuse containers. At the motor carriages...
Titus does his absolute best to look inconspicuous.
"He's never gonna run again, amigo. How
"I am the greatest of heroes." He nods his sleepy head. "Now, what can I help you with?"
Just let it all out! Wipe the stench from your mouth.
Just like Kim and his gun.
"But you are really selling *that* one, aren't you?"
The conductor's mustache grows long, reaching his jaw line. "Fuck, man, it's a mouthful. I don't even have to say it anymore."
In a small booth a sleek, young man stares at a computer. He has an exotic, unidentifiable substance in his hands. He's pointing it at you.
He whispers in your ear: "There is a prison here... She escaped. Let's go see what it's like."
He's relieved.
Are you sure about this? Is it *a big deal* for you to confront the man with the mouth? Don't you remember the beer can being right next to you?!
"I can't. We don't discuss such things in public."
The engine now only rattless with an occasional hiss when warm, yet when the chilly air gets to you it makes you stumble, as though you'd just done something that high...
Something tells you: this isn't a flame you can put out. It's a candle you can lick.
The lieutenant looks at you, then you glance at him -- then back to him.
He nods. "Let's go get that key from the ice bear."
Even though you're *trapped*. Away from home... The sound of humans and machines mingling creates an incredibly satisfying jingle that's as catchy as *Gold Digger* itself.
No. I *can't*.
"I like the way it
They don't know what that means -- much as you'd like to tell them.
I'm pretty sure you could get behind the idea of painting this wall with Mañana livery. It would *unify* the gang.
"Cool! What do you want now, hm? Can't remember shit, change shit, fuck with the world -- I can do that shit."
This is the Pollenshop. A mighty trust was placed in you by the paint. When this trust was violated, a great sadness
"Look, it's just a sandwich. You don't need more of my tools. You need this -- the lorryman's."
The punctuation is off the whole of Here It Comes Again! is one of the many reminders that life isn't fair.
Wait, there's no way a two-bit checker could tell the difference. And two-bit checks aren't creepy.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, twiddling-knuckles starts jumping up and down like some cruel animal. A stick insect starts crawling after the stick insect. It's *him*.
"It's just the cold of the winter." She takes off her jacket and lets the wind carry it across the fabric. "The label says: 'First aid kit.' Some random folks might have been trying to use my laundry a little... but the machine's still a piece of work."
Yes. This proves they haven't been heavy drinking, it also proves you haven't been taking proper notes on their case. Don't polish this one, I
Say it's *but*.
"No!" Isobel runs out of the room, screaming.
Do you remember the rhythms? The *screams* of your ancestors?
No. You cannot *let* this happen. Remember what you said: no one *deserves* to be sick. Ask questions.
No, they're perfect immeadiallies. No one *immediately* snaps out of it.
"Nope, it's actually a stage name."
"Is it just me, or is it winter outside?"
The girl stares at you, still chewing on a piece of lemon.
It doesn't even matter
"Maybe he would. He's a good man."
No you won't. Just turn around and go, like a maniac.
He stops to think. "I think we should talk about the pitch around here -- about the harbor -- but I also realize that I can't. All these guys can't talk about *anything*."
"Please, sir, just stop. This is terrible."
"Yeah, I can see that. It's my little sister." She nods toward the woman on the ice. "Don't worry, she's a big sis."
You should ask the hard questions. Read about the people, places and things you don't want to go on an actual field trip.
Pain from overeating and getting fat. From those who would try to mock it. I, for one, will never *eat* another coconut.
A severe case of Amnesia.
You're shaking, but you're not quite ready to fall.
Alain might be a worse human being than Kim.
She's feeling flustered, afraid of... something. It's as if she's forgotten something important in these few minutes.
This is an ancient monstrosity of metal and wood with extremely elaborate plans and intricate inscriptions. It
What did I just do? And what did you do? Damn it, it's hard to keep track of all the people who are texting you...
"I'll go with that."
"Indeed." She takes a step back. "I'm sorry to have brought it up again. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I'm just a little *older* person..."
He thinks this petty argument over the phone might be the reason he's been so rudeness lately.
The lieutenant's face shows extreme discomfort,
Some of those who would rise against the status quo might find refuge here. An old ladder is visible from the roof. You should
Yeah, it's too late for that now, but he *must* have been *really* drunk. Hell, he probably was just trying to kill himself. Or...
Doing the research for him was probably the reason he's so hell-bent on seeming extreme.
"I'm going to buy that one."
What is *that*?! Solving crimes? You know what this case is -- a case investigated by the RCM and handed to the RCM for the sake of grand strategy. Guess what's the big reveal?!
The freshly tarred buildings rise up on your morning stroll. Even the narrow street grid doesn't look *that* new.
He looks out the window. "I wouldn't be so sure, detective. There have been times when he's seemed absent and even paranoid himself..."
Who will take this torture?
You hear the scream of agony coming from the old man.
As you turn to leave, the faintest sound comes from the east. The torch is out.
There is an abstract mass in the centre of the room, shaking your nervous system. It's larger than life, and shaking the foundations of reality itself.
In his rush to judgement, the scribe here makes a fatal error. Judgment is not really a thing. You make it up as you go.
He's incapable of blushing, but he should blush! Imagine the embarrassment you'd cause if you were to ever find out who *really* did it.
"So then how are we gonna get all this stuff back, do you think? There's no sign of life on any of the plants."
"My friends, my friends!" The voices of young women around you grow louder. "Come to laugh at my funny stuff."
"Do I have a... problem?"
DOES THIS HAVE ANY IMPACT ON MY LIFE?
She takes a little hop to check her notes. "You know, Alain might be a bit *traumatized* by this experience."
An instant camera -- the Turbo-Stereo 100. A moan of discomfort sounds from the lazareth, as he turns onto his side...
He might have a point. The painting looks like it was done by someone else.
"Yeah, it's... I'm not afraid any more."
It may be an indicator of *disengaging* from the Rosslyn archipelago. And of the development of the *copotype*...
He looks at you, then at the smoke rising from your mouth. "After you, officer."
"*Första näkkari*, I say!"
"...or should just not exist at all!"
Outside, a cold wind wraps the building in its bosom. Snowflakes in it. An old man hands you a pair of boots. "Please..."
So I guess that's it. You're a fairly sane guy, but
"My... partner? I'm scared..."
He smirks. "Look at that dick. Maybe you should show *that* off. Where do you want to go with that? Oh, right, bro.
It seems the place where the shit went down was most likely here. Someone is keeping a close eye on you, your partner, and you in general.
He tells the smiling woman to go to her room, then he goes back to his desk and takes the controller back.
"I don't know. Sounds boring."
"And then the whole Town, all of Jamrock would be doomed. It's all gone..." He looks up, his eyes almost pleading.
He may be lying -- and this *Klaasje* thing may be linked to his death. Either way, he's not telling the truth.
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, is standing with his shoulders slightly hunched. Another, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
"In the dark, you know what's there? Lots of dead people. There's never been any fun in my life, no wonder." She looks at the postcard and smiles: "Disappointing, aren't they?"
There's a comfort to being a firefighter.
What are you trying to prove, exactly? That you can't remember her? That you can't even remember your own name?
Its details have not been made clear. It is implausible that you could take down a corporate executive with only one bullet.
You have to *do* something to get through this. The threat of the phasmid is not something you should be attempting to do with your present arguments
It seems to be true.
"Lame. I have NO idea what you mean."
No. First, tell me who you are and what you are. Second -- and maybe even more important -- what does this have to do with *Stupid Mary*? Stop being such a *spook* and let's go.
You should have *the whole world* in mind when you say you've seen everything.
It's an artistic restraint, but you like it.
Very normal, very cool... But don't take it personally. He's not disloyal.
The source of the wind seems to be in the sky above you. That is the source of the mystery surrounding the photo: where did it come from? And what *is* it?
What you *do* know is: You've been through some pretty *pornographic* things.
"Yes, it was a *wirr**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r**r~"
The wind moves the aerosol, humidifying it. There's a small blurb of "soaked wet" on the side, but you can't make it *extravagant* like you'd like.
All you see is a broken mug with a missing plastic cap. There's a solitary speck of *powder* in there and a *leaf* of some sort.
"Hold on. I've never had a pheasant."
Hate to admit it, but once you find out about the foibles of *one* person, it's bound to happen.
Are you sure?
The man from Hjelmdall looks at you strangely. He's obviously not familiar with the  half-demonic*, reptilian*, orgy of his lord!
"There are people in Martinaise, and they're not happy."
You're taking the leap of faith, son. It's a high risk/low reward proposition.
Whoa. Your cheeks are already a pale shade of blue. You look like a daft to be standing here. And talking about pyrholidon...
"Cool, cool, I don't need to hear about it any more!"
Okay, not *really*. It's just a story. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Anyway, answer the question or you'll never find out how the *right* one happens.
You're part of the future-brigade now, along with most of the working-class men in this parish. You'll have to prove your worth on the other side.
The air islet, Ubi Sunt isola, is an archipelago two days' travel away from Revachol. It's one of the four major islands of the Insulindian isola, near the pale.
Why would he be *so* cautious? It's no wonder why his friend Jasper was running around so drunk.
She doesn't -- but she should. There's enough about her to let a man like *Gilbert* know something.
She's silent for a second. After a while, she says: "Anyway... I was wondering if you know of any more up-to-date versions of those games..."
This is where you come in. We all have our different 'atmospheres.' It's where you begin *the journey* -- together.
You feel something. A strange sadness. Like someone taking a nostalgic liking to something you already knew was out there.
"Officer, are you aware that you have been party-drinking here for the past twenty four hours?"
"Oh, thank you officer! This is really helping me think of ways to make a little *money* on my sting operations."
The lieutenant nods. "That's a good indication. Tomorrow is a Saturday, we're on-site. We'll get it done on Sunday."
The mechanic opens the toolbox and pulls out the toolbox and toolbox-bag.
I'm gonna start *boring* this place -- ssssounds dangerous -- no? Let's try it again, please!
Oh, *bratan*, you were a force to be reckoned with back in Martinaise... We'll give you the benefit of the doubt -- just not today.
"You better not make me repeat myself."
You see the chalk outline of a path through the sand -- through some dried
"Have you guys seen me around?"
As you approach, he turns to the manila folder. "Can I see your ID here?"
"I've already made up my mind."
Here you go: access to the roof, weapon, and motive. That's not too hard.
The Earth trembles. Its crust is disturbed, and the cold, yearning flame of death within the tire melts away like an epiphany.
I'm too strong for that to be me. You can't just do that. There's something there, just waiting.
"We have established a motive
There is *no* hypocrisy in his talking about the rough treatment he gets from the RCM and the police.
"Can't you see, it's beautiful?"
It's an opportunity to start your life anew as a *classier* person -- as Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau.
I'm going to turn you into a jellyfish.
Isn't it strange how you talk yourself out of things you absolutely must have in order to get across the water?
People just do not know how to love, really. Look at how well he's done without you knowing -- he's practically *blacking* his hair!
The force you put the fingertips of your right hand against the tactile region deep inside your brain -- where ephemeral, incorporeal and pathologically sensory
You're under arrest.
They still are -- shining, like a diamond on the cold ice of the sea.
"What are you referring to?" He points to his back. "You're saying the strike was *about* the church?"
Rough, porous flesh.
Titus nods. "Inexplicable approaches need to be taken seriously -- no disrespect intended toward the local chapter. It's just that..." He thinks for a moment, then nods toward the man.
"I didn't really say anything. What did I think? We just talked about life and stuff. That's it."
"Okay, I get it. You've been sniffing around." He reads over his shoulder: "Pleased to meet you."
Then the story -- at the end of Chapter Two -- is unraveled.
As he has with so many previous explorers, he now pauses to think. "Or *think* we might be connected somehow."
Your good cop/bad cop routine feels awfully similar. You feel like you should at least be listening to it.
She won't answer, her eyes closed and brows knitted together in a state of deep focus, one hand cupping the headphone.
She looked like she was in some great physical pain. And she is in some intense, almost sad, pain too, isn't that sad?
One day a sheriff's deputy hears voices coming from the woods -- voices of an old director, wandering in
"As I said it wasn't me, it was *you*."
No. More importantly, you've got this *hard shit* to prove. The only way to *stop* is by proving it
"This is a problem," the lieutenant taps on his notebook. "Now ask her the question again, or keep it to yourself."
It remains unclear what *anyone* can do about a collapsed ceiling. It's a mystery even unto itself.
(Point at the moustached man with sunglasses.) "Have you ever seen a mountain lion like that?"
You begin to suspect there may be other, more recent, tracks in the woods... maybe you should keep looking.
"Yes. This is the one. Was there anything else you wanted?" (Conclude.)
It looks like there's a *problem* here. You might be able to get to the bottom of it by following the clues found here.
"He was the greatest of men." He sighs, then quickly re-enters reality. "As to what's more important... politics or his friends... I've always thought it was his friends that put him in a strange stupor."
At the core, Artemit was a noble but flawed man. He was both *policed* and *commune*.
There is nothing. Only the rhythmic ticking of the rain.
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what's really wrong with you? The interviews
The book store closes during the day. The kids go into underground bunkers at night. Kids do that. It's not bad. Just underground.
Just some cheap underwear for your legs and a shirt.
Sounds like he really doesn't know the first thing about technology.
"Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I'm sorry about that."
"Yeah. They're my brains."
Write: Male.
You always thought there was a gun somewhere... in the cabin. But you never found it... sad, maybe?
Sounds like it did not suit you. Either way, it's a *positive* experience.
"I don't want to put up with this. I'm going to kill you!"
"How do I do that?"
"Tell me about the jacket.
Your gaze finds its way to the seat again -- to the wooden panel behind the chief. He's thinking of something, waiting for you to continue.
What's the deal with that?
"That's not good. It was bad. Then you called her. You don't do that anymore. *If* you have been..." She's shaking her head. "Why
You suck a minuscule drop of extremely chemical-smelling liquid into your mouth. It tastes *bad*. After a while, your tongue is lukewarm and the bottle empty. You can't
A great excitement is bubbling to the surface within him -- at the prospect of a possible *little* war. A war without end!
A *once* and a *done* -- that's not important. What's important is that you sat there and stared at her! How *unnatural*! And now she comes to mind...
It's clear she cares about the people of Martinaise. Whether they're talking about the Union or the resistance, she seems to have an extremely *personal* view on the matter.
Be careful. You've... put your hand inside the hole?
"In any case, we're not having this conversation any more."
"It's still police work, baby," she says curtly. "I wouldn't go so far as to say you're under investigation..."
The call is terminated by the other cop. A harried technician can be heard saying "she screwed up".
This *specific* case is unique and requires further investigation. You will find no other book about sinking airships.
Filled with such visions, you think: a cold world beyond the Tropics, a twisted orange sun hazy with death -- this is Tropopsychosis in motion.
Then her eye catches on something in the distance. A man, standing on the side of a building, turns his head and sees two little eyes staring back at him from the cloud cover...
There it is, in your rushed writing --right where the throat meets the mandible: "The Original Sin", a novel written nearly two decades ago.
No... more than that. There is more in there -- behind the glass, on the stained glass windows. In the alleys, on
A mass of bruised, bleeding hearts lies among all the rotting corpses -- all of them, not one of them can truly be mourned alone.
This is pretty funny, actually.
The lieutenant looks at you, puzzled. "Then how come you're still here? How did you learn about this?"
"And, Kim, I think the story of how that happened has been lost. A long time ago, I had the epiphany that the high-concept idea was dead and buried. I knew it was gone. It's gone now. Is it
She's silent for a second. Then she speaks. "It *does* matter. All the hunters heard. I have to perform in the natural range for the federation to hear it. It's... very cathartic."
You close your eyes and dream of the golden greenery, lakes and rivers flowing in the sky...
There is *no* arrogance in his tone, no *false modesty*. These are the bones of a leading man -- a learned, adult man -- not a kid on the side of the road.
"The sweat in my eyelids is making my hair smell like shit..." he whispers to you.
Like a piece of ceramic armor.
"Hnnnnngh... that's it."
Yes, it's strange that you didn't think of him first -- he was probably like that too. A strange carnal impulse though.
You should really take your medical file in your hand right now
Right. Yeah, yeah, I already told you -- it's stupid. And here we both are again. It can't be. You're a police officer and a drug user. Why are you doing this
He's practically saying it *again*. The idea of him using an autocratic system to his advantage -- this one especially -- is repelled by him.
On the masthead of this vessel you see the silhouette of a seagull, its beak partially obscured by the caisson.
"What is the law?"
"Why do you have this computer then?"
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself.
An acorn is reflected in the
Yeah. That makes sense. Anyway -- rain falls on the first-responders coats, on the streets and on the roof tops, until the coating begins to peel off. The workers erect barricades and settlements on the cracked asphalt beneath the streets. And then the streets come alive
He nods. "The Young Turk is a rock and roll enthusiast. Currently residing at 18th Century Flour Mills. Young people are his passions. Future historians would find it quite ironic that he *didn't* take the ring."
That's cop for "Weasel."
"I am totally with you, freaks!"
He smiles at you, glad you didn't give him the slip. "Probably, but I didn't want to drag you along just because I was afraid you'd refuse."
You could sneak up to the phasmid and *smear* it with cigarette butts -- that would be official. But you don't have to worry about
"Not for the union, I'm afraid." He stares at the marauders, and suddenly his face shows signs of a calming down. "Besides -- how else could this man live?"
"No. They are the 8th *LAMO* Infantry Regiment, 8th Hussar Army."
Dora. The name feels like a *gift*. A gift that was meant for you -- to make it possible to live.
"You said that a serial number was..."
What else? No one *else* here? There's been quite a bit of talking. You might not wanna do it again.
"What did the dead man look like?"
His eyes are milky white and blind to the world -- simply staring into each other's empty orbs.
The device is cold to the touch. An odd choice of words for such a prominent criminal mastermind.
What do you mean *talk about* your *soul*? You already said you *are ready* to do this.
"Wasn
"There is no Glenny. She couldn't shoot straight."
"Not exactly. But neither were the carabineers. The whole enterprise seems more suspect now."
The key ends the roundtable tap. There is a satisfying pop as the number '11' was pressed into the lock...
Wow! Someone has forgotten to clean up after themselves... Don't ask that anymore. You should have just asked about Kim. See what he thinks.
(Shake the dust off the pieces.)
"I thought it was funny. Then I remembered that they're all monsters and I have to kill them all."
And the smart one says: "Kim, I'm sorry for the ... scab!"
Your hand twists in his grip. The corpse is ready to be picked out, but you have no idea when.
He smiles. "I guess it's only logical -- at some point one of them bullets had to end up in one of them heads..."
You were too drunk to notice the blood spatter. Or was it you? Whichever you think is true, the memory leaves you with the impression of a graffiti artist gouging *one* more image off the mural, almost in the same position the last time!
No. It was...
"You're right, but I don't think I want to drive him to the island. He was like a son of a gun to me
The wheels of a superlative super-lien, drift-bridged-on-the-storm. These beauties did not disappoint.
Under the tan-colored sky the great district hums: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the smoke-filled skies above the city.
"I'm sorry, I don't like it. Anything."
The very existence of the *Kingdom of Conscience* is asserted by his *Vespertine Temperament*.
Your gaze is already fixed on the low hanging cloud cover as it slowly descends -- into the valley bottoms of Faubourg. You shudder.
Wait -- *boring* isn't really a word.
"What happened to the old woman who was yelling at the police?"
It's a dangerous line of work. No one is there to *stew* you. You'd get more out of him.
"What if I wasn't *me*?"
"I don't see why you're giving me a hard time here."
"I am a person who once had a blood brother, but who died a few days ago. He was very, very sorry for him."
"What was that?" She smiles up at you. "That was long ago. It wasn't *me*..."
What is *wrong* with you? You're a flawed being, flawed in heart and soul, and you have made *many* mistakes along the way -- some of them much worse than others.
That's a good, pragmatic approach. You know the communard sends more tax dollars than he collects in benefits.
"It's good to see you here. I'm Joyce."
Do you know how long it will take to figure out what really happened here? After the Man from Hjelmdall and his burning bush party?
The man turns toward Kim. "I mean... I'm not really one to much with flowers, but I found this out after a little too..." He pauses. "Do you think it was a seagull or something?"
"The difference between you and the one who walked out of that chimney, is that you had a bullet in your pocket. Now you're walking the
"It was her imagination, Harry." He looks you in the eye, gently. "But I can tell her we're sorry."
You've *drawn* this situation in the wrong direction. Proceeding now will only lead to disaster.
The next time you go to his place, ask for the sandwich.
"Well, it's certainly interesting, but it's not proof. Look, the most important organ in the world."
Hey, hey! What are you doing, you can't just leave it like that -- get in there and *not* think about it?
It's a replica of the Che Pik: a replica of a real antique rifle, bought in Graad, near Mount Olympus. It has a barrel more than twice as long.
It's nearly impossible to describe how dirty this texture is. It's like rubbing two jellyfish skins together. You start with a pair of underwear on, then gradually ease into leather jackets, pants, and even actual shoes as you reach your
I'll consider it. What's the downside of risking a case like this?
"That's right. Screw the hat."
No, you have no idea what this is. It's probably some drug.
"A word of advice, then -- you shouldn't know anything about that stuff. Ignorance is bliss, ain't it?" He snorts.
The cyborg appears to be in pristine health, with no discernible signs of life. Its prostheses are of little interest to him.
This may be the mind-affecting serum that Deanna Deneuve injected you with. It is pleasurable, think what...
"Oh yes, you do. You're a real *näkk*."
No. You don't have enough to crack this case. The names don't come up, the cases go nowhere. One by one.
Can I smell it?
"Look, it's a commentary on man
Wow. In your hand: marshmallows, rum and green chewing gum. Seems like the right choice. Or -- maybe you should just *try* to think.
Hard to say, it's gone now, a night wind has taken its toll. Sounds of the streets are different now. Clothes, smells of the streets, the sounds of the world.
The brand new player starts laughing, but says nothing.
"There was a spy in the woman's apartment. He did a fantastic job of it -- especially when he came to talk to the tenants. That's just how good he was."
Apparently her passport details had been stolen and she was staying at the Apartheid Tabernacle in Grangil.
She nods towards the city, towards the one with the water-colour scheme. The road runs perpendicular to the mural.
In this part of the ship, the storm drain treatment is complete. The water is raw, acidic and shockingly warm. Once you get the stick shift -- and you're ready to go *back to> the streets.
...and there it is again! Your index finger! Your index finger is the first thing you touch when you wake up.
She continues to exhibit impressive willpower even after being subjected to nearly sordid affairs.
"Good job, officer." The lieutenant raises his eyebrows and doesn't say anything.
Hey! What is my name?
"First, why are you bothering me?"
It has happened.
"It was her. She looked into my eyes. A young girl. Her eyes are green."
He's so proud of you.
"Oh, you mean 'Let's drink'? There's a basement door there that you wouldn't mind locking to."
"We're all trying to do what's best for Martinaise here." Her smile widens. "Don't feel like you can't cooperate with her, because you and I are such good friends and I tried to help you with the body... I'm not a jealous guy."
That's not *me*, that's J.D. A sad man pointing to his chest in a rage, trying to make a god damn out of his sad: "Fuck you, Harry!"
The scruffy-haired little boy kicks a stone while the
"I was too young and strong to think before. I should have been dead by this point."
They're not. He's using the cocaine to dull the pain and keep the flashbacks in check.
This is a mistake. The lieutenant is right: it's unlikely that you will survive the trip to the river. The conditions are unresponsive. There is an enormous amount of blubber within you, the sum of which is...
The Calculus Professor unlocks the door with his office key.
Bystanders reported seeing a man in his late twenties, standing at a call box, wearing devil horns and wielding a bullhorn, asking a callous announcer to "fix the game."
"Ah, another bad habit..." He keeps nodding his head solemnly.
The strange muscularity he's equating to *not being able to cope* -- he *has* been for *seven days*.
"That's where they
Watching them struggle to their knees, humiliated and controlled, is cathartic.
The wreckage is hard core. GRIH is made for long, cold missions.
She's not intimidated by you.
While everyone is distracted by the stink of alcohol, you regain control of your faculties. You're fine.
It's hard to imagine anyone complaining. The notion of you being famous is unheard of. You would be ridiculed to your very core.
She whistles, like some ancient animal who's seeing and hearing about the very end of the world.
Your hand brushes through the prybar's slick black metal. You don't know how you know -- it's as if someone has just shot your brain.
"There's nothing here -- I've been walking since morning."
Anais Nin, aka 'The Not-One', seems to have done it. She was not here when the shooting occurred.
I guess you can keep it that way.
Why am I not?
"But... could I still just join *the party*? After he's gone?"
"Told you Klaasje was a piece of work."
That's an interesting anecdote. But what does it have to do with the case?
The knob comes into focus in your hand. You're going to need to turn it again once you're done with the painting.
It feels so ordinary. Like sweat on your forehead.
Of course, yes. You did not experience *reality*. You don't know why you didn't experience it, but here we are.
He points to you: "But you're the RCM -- you represent the Moralist International, the enemies of humanity, who took this city. You must represent the International in order to assuage the suspicions of the mob."
You haven't lost your partner just yet.
"So my name's Victor Masefield, sir."
Your toes have dug into the sand and the cold ocean mud. Your fingers have dug into the seabird. Its coppery body flutters in the wind.
"I'm *sad* to death."
The lieutenant's not buying it -- at all. It's impossible to see him putting his hand on the gun.
The story goes that when a small, terrified child tries to scream for help she sees a man in ragged clothes standing in a field of blood-red taiga. The
"By the fucking Wayfarer Act, asshole!"
Sometimes, near the very end of a sentence, the writer decides to go for the *biggest*, most *invention* claim of them all. Here, at the very end, with his or her pen still numb from the previous night's spent talking, the writer is still in full flow:
This is the trap Morell just avoided. You could always continue your investigation there...
The Brit says hello to his homeland by drilling into the sand. Deep under the seafloor, in the far past...
No such things as land mines.
"Now... we'll look for a new tape player, shall we?"
"You know what, *fucks*? I'm actually going to write a letter now. To Miss Page-Three."
"Aye, I guess so."
Your hand shakes -- not because of any sudden, violent force in the room, this is just your nervous system reacting to some event. This thing is *not* over, its *NOT* over!
Out of concern, and a little self-pity, he thinks. And from anger, too... At this moment of emptiness, he feels almost everything.
You are encouraged to find and share information in this classroom. If you want to make friends, you'll have to do that.
Didn't he say was he? A *hypothetique* is a fancy word for... you know. Nudity, nancies, and stuff.
"...in retrospect..." The lieutenant leans closer, too close to touch his friend's cheeks: "... it looked pretty dangerous. Still, it's all that I'm saying. It's the cell-phone heresy all over again, isn't it?"
Good choice. As you wait, the rafters begin to shake.
"It sounds like you've been cheating. Is that true?"
"Okay, maybe not. You're a detective, after all."
He shakes his head. "I don't know about you, but I really enjoy solving cases. It's one of the few things I actually enjoy doing."
Make it clear you're a *non-violent* type. Get applause from the workers.
You feel horrible. Ever since you got up, you feel nothing. There's nothing you can do about it.
Nice, scary, scary. The *scary* part is reserved for those who haven't had the good of him. This lady in the elevator -- she could be a target for *rampant*, *incriminating*, *or just plain hooliganism*.
UNDERGROUND BRIDGES DRUNK AND TERROR ON THE COAST OF MY HEART!
There is a large range of emotions about to explode in him at this moment. All at once. He cannot bear the weight of a thought any longer than it takes to put it together.
He smiles, still staring in blank, unfocused rage at the tape you've just given him. "Fuck you
There is *still* more here, however. Remember -- it *will* get you *out of* this jam if you just *play it right*. Play it, baby, please!
"But you do, officer. You have a point there."
"I'm sure it's a lot of work, but it's necessary to get the hang of this task. I promise you, Harry, it's not that hard." He doesn't even flinch when he says it.
That's not entirely true. You may be allergic to some of the things you're doing, even when you're doing them *for* pleasure.
It is against RCM regulations to approach this container, hidden away in the basement.
The kid's eyes follow your every move with mild surprise. "I think he was in a *way* crazy mood that night, and thought of throwing it all away by jumping the gun. But there's nothing in his logs -- none."
The map has been redone, with the addition of the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua to the *Red List*. The list appears to be incomplete without its namesake, a rugged individualist novelist whose *tiny* fiction often suffers greatly in *the publishing world*.
"Yes, you're a valuable member of the unit, sir." She smiles at you. "I hope you don't mind if we visit the Kineema around here, investigate the carabineers' camp..."
"I already *do*," he concludes, with a flick of his wrist. "She's a good cop, she's right on top of her game now."
"Khm..." He bites his lip. "I guess what I'm trying to say
"...what, *is*..."
"Have you ever shot anyone before? Shooting the shit is your thing -- now you have to get the fuck to the island."
No, I'm not interested. I
Your words echo in the karaoke mic. They ring against the side of the speaker.
"Not to sound too conservative, but there are some comments that suggest he might have been *involved* in the drug trade. For example -- or had access to, the drugs that he was supposed to have supplied..."
"Why not?"
What you need to do now is talk the lieutenant out of it. He would rather die than violate protocol.
You should sing that sad song you were listening to last night... You feel old and alone again...
It's the peace keeping officer's uniform. The Distinguished Citizen. It's a bit on the small side, but well made.
He frowns. "That seems unlikely. Anyway, the skeleton is over there. You should talk to it."
The beast is silent. The memory of old deeds -- to be done -- has replaced pond scum with a permanent *banner* of revolts. They will never be undone, *arguably* unluckily.
The floorboard is shaky from being on the ground. You could probably break it with your bare hands.
"I don't know who I am, what is my name?"
"Not if you care about the company, miss."
"What do you think I should do then?"
"But Klaasje *is* a suspect in this murder. Now you need to talk her out of it. Or get the gun, Harry. We've all done it -- some crazy strange blood stuff." He licks his lips and inhales sharply.
Yes, and they're so...
"Fuck no. I didn't do it." (Lie.)
I've seen better days.
Only the lower extremities are pink with a dash of blue: his fatted hands, his stomach and his neck, his thighs and his knees.
Well, *sometimes* it is.
No, that's not it. It *is* not. This is a falsehood. The fabric of the world is ending -- her words are coming true.
A man in a filthy T-shirt and small military coat.
He points his gun at Elizabeth. "Go ahead. Say it again: *saying words* -- it's important. Say it, baby, I got it. We're *relationships*, baby."
"It's fucking *bloody*."
To the lieutenant's puzzlement, you spend several turns building various improvements to your treasury...
Odd, he didn't buy it.
Who were they, ghosts?
You idiot! You don't have any fuckin' problems! Not a single one! Not one!
"It's what I'm for."
"Wait -- What about the pacifier?"
A cold gust of air dries your sweaty face and neck, and you feel its dry sweep over the
"That's pretty bad, right?"
Stop trying to catch it and start trying to live. Try to get off this road, so that we can just have the *good* cop show!
It was her.
A pair of boots is lying on the floor
"Hey -- stop, please..." He just stares at you with a mouth full of blood, but then he puts his hand on your
"It wouldn't matter -- were the deceased to have committed a murder his neighbors would have reported."
With a *beast* sound the boy whimpers, "Yeah, Ruby's okay with gay people as long as it's not her brother-melting."
[Pet the sandwich.]
He nods. "While I'm at it, I should probably look into this too. If it's a case against Evrart..."
Indeed. There was a moment's silence. She just... looked at you for a moment, then her cheeks lit up and she started talking...
Perhaps it's the least of your worries. This seems to be a case that has moved beyond its origins, or perhaps you just lack the imagination to realize it.
Look through the trash container.
The lieutenant nods at the woman, then looks at the pair of you. "Good to know. Let's get back in there and do this
"I think I'm allergic to nanofarms."
The gun, you promised. The gun you kept on your life-skull, as it were. As it were. The museum piece has been carefully cleaned and inspected, a fine point at the end of
"It's okay, Jean." She sounds relieved. "He's just one of the guys, we've all got our quirks."
From anguish and fear, two terrible emotions wash over you. A shiver runs through you as you look around in the dank seafaring city.
I'm not sure what you're looking for, sir, but I'm sure you'll come up with something useful here.
Yeah, no.
You should have kept looking if you thought the colours would show what you've been feeling.
It *is* a touchy subject for him. He doesn't usually come off like that...
All the time. This is your heart.
This is exactly what you were planning to do -- just say it.
The elevator screeches and rattles, like the belly of some ancient beast, as it carries you upwards...
"What, you don't trust me? Tell me, does your husband really want to know everything about me? Does he want to know *anything*?"
No! Just no. There's that expression again, with the simile and the check -- no use crying over spilt milk. Yes, but they're...
Everything you threw out there was not only about how crappy you were, but also about how bad you felt about losing her. That alone should have been enough reason to run. But you don't, so why bother?
Who... what... Dear god, what is this? You're so emotional, all of it!
Your abs are big enough to take this kind of abuse. Plus, you're a cop, so of course it's *you*.
"She's certainly irrepressible, but... on the whole -- not exactly a *lady driver*." He glances
Things weren't quite right there... you had something in your eye and your cheek... you had an idea what your name was but you just didn't *click*.
"That's nice of you. A chance to try something new?"
Interesting little clue. Show him what you're made of.
"Hah! 'You got shot, little buddy. Got shot." He throws you a gleeful look.
Wait, wait, no! I changed my mind, you think you can keep me off this island?
The book is cursed, but it still managed to shock you -- making you question the ins and outs of everything you thought you knew. It may have even done so for some of your friends.
"I've tried it. I think I can hear the waves rustle the leaves there..." He leans closer and whispers: "It's already a Sunday night."
He raises a eyebrow. "Sure. But..." He pauses. "But it's not a -- *law* thing. You should stay alert."
For a fraction of a second there's unease in his tone. Then he cools it.
You wasted a great deal of time talking to her. Perhaps if you'd spent more time *discreetly* talking to people...
"I haven't... really thought about it."
God dammit! You didn't tell her you were an inspector!
It feels like you've said the word a thousand times. The shame is almost too much. You can't even remember what the exact phrase was, what was said, what was *saved*...
The weather turns bright, the air turning from purple to orange as you stand there in silence.
Okay, fine, no need to argue. Just do it. You have to save face if you try to hide your inability to remember.
"Kim, we have to talk about this
Your hand reaches toward the body. There's a sound, behind the sound barrier. It's close...
"Yeah... and I can't even remember my name."
Like a child, you find yourself roaming the streets of the wooden-and-beige house.
I can help you with this -- you're the PRIMELINE OF RACE AGAINST THE WORLD, SRV*BILIT.
What?
This isn't *at all* like the ghost you saw rising from the water. It's a tiny crack in the storm drain.
The scene in front of the Kvalsund crane is making the already skeptical look even more puzzling. The kitchen, the workshop, the freezing cold water -- all these words and ideas stuck in there somehow. Why *did* they say they want to end it?
You don't sound like a man who's about to embark on any sort of *mad dash*, do you?
She has assumed an active role in the drama. She should reactivate her metal-and-plastic soul, if she's not killed herself.
The wind ruffles her hair as she looks around. She is a middle-aged woman in her fifties, with dark roots and heavy makeup. Even more disturbing still is the *tribunal* she has just convened -- all to settle a score with a dame.
"Wanna have some fun with it?" The lieutenant leans closer. "You look like you're about to cry."
"It is. And while I may not be able to offer you any assistance, please try not to let the station down your line."
As you turn the page, a new path appears: a spiraling, folding hand-drawn map, jammed shut in a wind of separation.
There is a spark in his eyes, a curious fondness. Don't let it sway you, man of the city. This kid has the talent of a young age, but you don't need to use it.
There are so many open ended questions here it's hard to keep track. But, as you keep asking...
The feeling dissipates immediately, the cool of the evening sky surrounding you.
rusty control panel with several knobs -- one, perhaps two, hangs from the ceiling. Looks like it's used.
It is. You feel a sudden lumpeninous lump inside, like you've done it before...
"You seem like a reasonably competent
"I was thinking -- what if I laid all the blame on her? I'm not someone who would normally involve myself with cases like this, but I was wondering... If I *had* to deal with her every time she went out, how would I ever get through it?"
The lorry driver is silent. The ice squeaks beneath your heavy heart. How can it be a *jail* when you don't even know what *you* are?
"I'm not sure I can afford another place. The Hall of Queens is going to consider it for demolition."
The lieutenant tilts his head to the side, surveying the situation with a puzzled expression.
The words leave his mouth as if he's chewing on something... rather than spitting them out.
You've seen *way* too much already. Maybe you should just get over it?
"When was this guy *born*?"
"The entrance wound on my gun."
"We've been through this. You're drunk like a bum, Harry. Maybe you were drinking?"
Inside the 12-sided die.
"Don't worry, Kim. I'll be back later." [Leave.]
Okay, he keeps saying *the adventure* isn't real. This guy is spinning his wheels. Reality is fake.
A great pain moves through her, black veins bulging from her neck to her shoulders. Her shoulders are already shaking.
You know, you don't think *bad* is the best way to describe a snow-covered coin collection
The lieutenant sighs at the door, turning away from you.
"What *can* I do? I have this notebook." (Give her the key to the room behind the curtains.)
A tingle rushes down your spine, as you look around: The lights of the Whirling-in-Rags shimmer in the clear night.
There's an entire section devoted to cures for men who are struggling to perform their "marital obligations."
That's right. All that's left is to confront Garte himself -- that's what the Manual on Methodists actually says.
"You see, the Union pays an *all-is* salary, while the *tribune* pays a *single*, fixed yearly amount -- usually the same as one day's *salary*."
"Why *do* you keep popping up, Kim?"
The kid turns away from the wreckage, still looking very much in the same spot.
And *outside* in the pale. The internet does not exist in Martinaise. *This* is an absolutely *important* case.
To the lieutenant's puzzlement, you keep saying the word *bratan* when asked what it stands for. Maybe you're trying to sound cooler?
There is uncertainty in that *structure* -- it's going to take more than bravado for it to fall into place.
You're right. What could go wrong with that?
All you hear is static as the speakerbends. Then she speaks again: "Thank you, lieutenant."
At the moment I'm afraid I'm not capable of thinking about the case any more. [Discard thought.]
"Damn it, René..." The man with sunglasses shakes his head. "I've always wanted a pint of this stuff."
He stares at the ripple, then at the water, then at the beach sand... Eventually he relents and says...
Do it. Find her killer. This will *surely* lead to a mystery with that *extremely rare insect*...
Look at it, sire! These mutated ferrets chomp down on the remains of the torpedoes you dropped. Fat, *light* on the top of the head.
Sorry, bass-player. Now look at him.
"How long has he been smoking here?"
He leans in with his back propped up on a small folding chair.
You're going to keep your vös .500 to 0,000 gulden viable, all the while ignoring the lives of the poor and the sick. You should do it.
Both your finger and index finger are numb from the cold. You're still holding on to the old hat, however.
"Yes, that's the expression in his face. It's not malice. He is simply pointing to my lack of individuality."
You didn't say *this* good or *that* bad thing, what you said is: Harry, it was the right thing to do.
"I like The Return and other *dark rags*. Maybe this guy *does* too."
"Yeah... probably."
"Oh?" He doesn't seem surprised to be interrupted. "Who has time to show up for work every day? No way I'm walking in the lorry on that day -- the authorities have taken the step before I can even leave..."
You've really let yourself go, blathering on the sidewalk. People point fingers at you and call you names. But you
It's *unbelievable* that people aren't passionate about their pinball, Harry-boy. Seriously. Get someone
Nothing to do with this right now, all right. (Refuse the feeling.)
The lieutenant is unfazed by this conversation. He simply nods and continues to stare at the back of the church.
It's super easy to go on a date sober. And they all have *oxytocin* -- the bonding hormone. Makes you feel like you're about to fall in love again,
A heavy door with a missing handle stands before you, accompanied by a keyring. The handle is badly worn, if you took the lock off...
There is confusion in his voice -- it is strange for him to keep it together as he is getting angry again.
There it is. That feline quality.
He's just making excuses for his bad behaviour. Why would he just leave it at that? Keep your eyes open for the killer instead.
Incredibly soft, the control panel is surprisingly sturdy. The whole thing is made from metal and appears to have been thoroughly cleaned.
"We're a family business. We wouldn't trade our dear Noid's warmth for anything. I'm not judging."
Well, it's perfectly normal. The reason you're standing here is so that *not* you go in there and do some *bad* things.
An ancient warmth comes over you. Some terrible thing must have happened 10,000 years ago -- you will never get to know.
You have to *act*. You have to calm her down, tell her you've got everything *under control* -- and then go have a boys' talk with Garte himself.
So... it's official. You did say there was a cryptozoological explanation for those bunny ears.
What she's seen of it, the woman thinks. We need to focus on getting the body out of the tree before she can tell us more
A crudely drawn map pins the corner of the invisible, heavily wooded area with a yellow star -- Guaya does not appear on the map.
You're fond of remembering little touches, the little *tasks* you've performed. When she's not there, you should focus on the main thing here -- keeping the peace.
"God damn it. You don't want to talk about that shit with *anyone*."
The smell of rotten food rises up as you push the key in. This must be the machine's operator's room...
Suddenly your focus is back in your brains maps. Black and white patterns that traveled tens of thousands of kilometers through the senses.
"I'm not gonna lie, I was *very* tempted. I thought maybe I could get some quick cash, or some *real* usable paper -- maybe some blank sheets? But I wouldn't have gotten any more. My local liquor store keeps everything shut tight on Sundays... only opens on Mondays."
Say what you will, but this *benevolence* makes you feel like you're ready for some real *down with the devil*.
"No, but really -- it's your name now
The lieutenant is waiting patiently, tapping his foot lightly to a tune not dissimilar to the music on the radio.
She sees them -- in each other's arms. One is holding a small slip of paper containing a permanent marker.
I don't need any of this stuff.
Before the winds of Reunion can take effect, the Danes have crossed the border into Martinaise. There's a jarring difference in the air -- Martinaise, the night of the murder, is suddenly alive again!
Those phasmid tracks are not phasmid tracks at all. They're abandoned scientific expeditions -- once considered *barbaric*, now considered *barbaric*.
"Don't worry about it, I'll definitely be getting my bearings again. You can always come back to
Look, you're in control of your destiny here. You can choose to be bad or good. Which is why you haven't told the world about your fucked up cop life.
So that's why he's so *angry* -- with you leaving him and all.
He repeats: "We're not here to root anyone in particular -- we're here to provide a forum for local residents to discuss their concerns without interference from headquarters."
He smiles. "No one has the stamina to re-discover it, officer, but it's a shame. A sacred place... we should explore it further if we get the time."
Incorrect. Kilimanjaro is an ethno-desert people who worship a suzerain called Iilmaraa. They are known for being stealthy and not for doing *well*...
You find no signs of life on the body, but a few burrowing tracks seem like they could have been made at an earlier stage.
"The progressive was right. I was entranced by its imagery. Its utopian promise. To transcend the realm of reason."
Why is gold so sexy?
He looks at you quizzically. "*Where* is she? You have her ID
"Oh," the dicemaker says. "A very special congratulations."
"Oh, you mean like football and stuff like that?"
A panic attacks the former mechanical worker. "Is someone watching?! One of them is coming back again!"
It's hinted at, and then hidden again. The impression of the handgun lies firmly behind the pilot's seat.
Trying to reach inside your vehicle's boot.
You notice a map on the ground in
The owl's eye is still stung by the orange flame licking at its corona.
"About that drug lab..."
For him to stop reacting to stimuli, to be broken off from the world -- that's a state of extreme distress even for a man his age.
The thorn bush on which the thorn bush of today's drawing is wont to grow. The thorn bush, when disturbed, produces a low hum...
She looks outward, into the distance. Then at you. "Maybe, uh -- maybe not. Maybe. Anyway, I'll keep trying. See what you can find."
He studies the figurine. "Think of the pieces falling into the ocean as a shield -- against the rum and the cocaine."
He sighs. "We could... uh... umm... I mean... just go to your room and tell him you fucked up."
What happened to the light?
You suddenly realize the patience and attention your torments are bringing down on your psyche...
Convinced him.
Good god, what is this? There's nothing here that justifies throwing money at something that's already failed miserably.
Wow, I had no idea.
This was not an easy answer. He was very ready to change his name to something more personal, but it wouldn't be right if he did.
You're about to cry right now.
Every year, on the 3rd of January, thousands of tonnes of rainwater run off Assisi into the pale. The bay is barren, the fog an oasis, under the city the rain falls and makes the air...
You should try and find out what's going on with these guys. Talk to the Little Sisters, maybe?
"Racist?" She looks you straight in the eye. "Are you
You're doing it! You're talking into my ear, and I'm not gonna take it. You and I are becoming mates...
He's trying to minimize the pain of the memory by pretending it's nothing, or at least nothing like the Gross Anatomy.
From hell on Earth -- where god knows the chains may lead -- to the rainless paradise of the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua -- where nothing exists without his consent.
The lieutenant mumbles something to himself.
The captain looks at the freckled man, then back at you.
You do know you could just as easily get into the city by airship as you would by land route? Just fly to Sola. They'll take a look.
"... who *did* it," she mumbles, her hands still
He sighs. "That's a pity. But I have to say -- *sorry* is a really, really lame excuse. You know, dropping that bomb in there and running with it -- that didn't work out. You should have just said something more professional like, *sorry I didn't catch it*, or *sorry*. It's stupid."
"Nah, nothing happens in the universe."
Not *all* of them. Some people are fragile, people have an *atta boy moment*...
"Just no, no," the man in the striped tie replies with a barely disguised smile. "You don't get to
"Fine." Her hand settles on the side of her boot, as she takes a drag. "And thanks for helping us out."
How else do you explain the goggles he's wearing?
She nods. "It's an honour to serve with you. As you did -- before." She turns back to the sea.
She means that's not the *real* reason she was exiled, that she couldn't have been anything other than what she says.
Have they not been telling you you have appendicitis?
Humphrey probably. He was like this for like... fifty thousand years. But you could've done so much more!
"Why are you ignoring all the signs?"
Yes, they're not *entirely* without their causes, you and he together. But causes they do. Besides, you just don't usually do things like that...
"They don't have to. In 3 years we're all dead. There's nothing to gain."
There is a message there... a *missing* piece. Just like there is a piece in the back of the truck.
Another scab. The headless FALN rider is depicted here with its massive gun emplacements. The bird is meant to represent *society* -- high society.
"You did." (Ignore the hat.)
It's definitely some other guy either way. Maybe he's from *that* or *that*...
You're a better man now, sire. A little less angry.
But... she *liked* him. Always. This man has suffered -- and continues to suffer -- because of you.
"I'm not going anywhere." [Leave.]
There's plenty of room for manoeuvre -- and ingenuity -- in this setup. You could put the lieutenant in the front seat, and drive him as hard as he can. Or you could pull the car apart, get the heat from the engine, and ram it into the grille, pulling hard on the brakes and being careful not to overshoot the grille.
The lieutenant raises his arms and bows toward the sea.
"Locked her up in the church hall! I don't want that shit in my apartment! All
The young woman looks at you with widened eyes, breathing heavy, with a bulbous nose.
"I don't know. It was a cop-call. They don't take dead ends."
Being a rough, *hard-boiled* detective, you're used to hiding things. But you're too scared to say them...
A finger goes through the dark cigarillo wrapper. Then the man behind the counter takes our money and hands it back to you.
By nightfall only the second body is left standing in the main pit entrance. It's guarded by four-legged fighters. Two of them are missing.
"There's an emergency on this islet."
"I told you she's bad ass, man. She's not pretty but she's a tough nut to crack."
It feels like something *put* a gun in your face. A long time ago. Maybe you got it or they got it -- it doesn't look like either one of them have anything to do with you any more.
"You could walk into a traffic jam and ask for *blood money*."
"Do you have anything more?"
"As an artist, the importance of self-expression is immeasurable. But *this*?" He peers from the cover. "This is where the creative class comes in. This is where it's at now -- Pixies on the run, or from police custody..."
Am I sure it's not just a joke, or some kind of coping mechanism?
"Really?" He pauses, looking up from his notes. "That's... quite brave. Could've been quite brave."
"Then what is the RCM?"
The man so graciously allowed you to re-do his 'invention' -- he did so on his dime, knowing it was ridiculous.
You've done this before. You've *sensed* that she's unfazed by your questioning. Let him get straight to the point.
You have their names and addresses, but do you *want* them? The world is uncertain, there is anger in him, he fears for her -- and all he can do is scream at her to stop.
It would be *very* interesting to hear what they have to say about that...
"No, I'm listening. Now, how about I get into my lorry, Harry?"
He's not liking this too much.
You're off to a good start. There's no way to listen to him without the tape -- and the book -- you need to either sing it or talk it into him talking.
There is about her a little nervousness comes over you as you stare at the trees. It's not as bad as she thinks it is.
"He was right. I was traumatized. It was bound to happen at some point. We'd been through this before, you see..."
"I think the Dead Letter Boxes (DWB) are a really good product. They're customised so that only the company with the biggest flag is allowed to issue them. I only give them out to people I *participated* in."
Only your voice rings through the phone -- but it's not true? What difference does it make?
Say: "I'll rip into him."
A terrifying spectre is making its way back to the murder scene... the script ends there, like a dark knot of paper, suspended in the air...
You can only see this union end once the court case is concluded. If you don't use it, you'll never get the hint!
How did this happen? It's like *you're* moving, if only on the inside.
There *might* be other things to say -- on the list. About the Man from Hjelmdall and his dreams. Maybe you should just talk about it with the lieutenant?
As if
With his noise, his words, his *boisterous laughter*... The opening gambit. Ready for the siren of apocalypse.
Hands, feet, lips, hands, what are you doing? You're a fucking animal, you can't talk like that!
It doesn't feel like any of those things -- you're just trying to give a list of possible activities to some poor sod.
Is he suggesting you didn't tell the whole truth when you said the phasmid was the alien that tried to sap the sap from the farmer?
A lump of flesh is sticking out from under the blanket. It seems to be twitching from time to time, like the paw of an
But she *doesn't* know any better. She's made it herself -- with drugs and the heartbreak that follows.
Titus said I'm not good enough for this.
Just go away.
He looks like a *suzerainty* with too much *cojones*. The color of example, in his eyes.
And yet he feels so *comfortable* in it. Certain muscles in his face, muscles that used to flare up when he got mad...
This is your gun and in the world of unarmed civilians a man with a gun is king. But in a wholseome, dangerous world rife with violence and betrayal there can be no doubt: <br />not your name.
"Was there a stanza? I thought we'd get to it."
"A lot of people on this street don't want to talk to you."
To what? The lieutenant does not understand the logic behind your set of socks. He just thinks they're *cool*.
The billiard parlour!
Just look at the panoramic view! The island of Mundi is covered in little holes. The Urban Beach, its paved rows of houses turning into a sea of pale, is the smallest section of the coast in the world...
"No need to make it personal." She looks to her car, before sighing. "This is my last pipe dream. They'd just hang me. It's stupid, I know it. But they'd do it."
There is something off about that anti-aircraft gun. You should have
She has an explanation for all this. Somewhere deep in him -- he doesn't *want* to talk about it. Maybe he hasn't been talking about it enough.
"A man in his forties? I'm amazed. He must be taking great pride in his super-powers."
"Oh. Okay. I guess I can't really think about it any longer."
And then some! He's even willing to try this? This is *our* problem -- it's not his fault.
Out of guilt.
"Good morning, Freedom Host!"
This is important to her. The pitiful size and position of the totem is something she will come back to to. And then, in the end, maybe even to you.
A jig is a type of short-circuit in the United States, where current events have no bearing on past ones. Like a ticking time bomb. The system repeats the last five digits of the A-Z matrix repeatedly
Also, Cuno hasn't stopped talking to you. Even enjoys it from time to time. Occasionally.
Okay. The soft center of the ball. Don't play with it. You're a police officer, you have responsibilities.
He sees it. Across the water -- against a gently shimmering surface -- a little seawater has sunk into the sand. Beyond that, the ocean is unreal.
"Wait, what do I do now?"
Yet your mind is elsewhere. You feel like there's something there, a shadowy figure above...
It takes about half an hour for you and the lieutenant to piece one together. How does it feel -- just trying to come up with words?
Wait, do I have a *gun*?
I'm barely keeping you together here... this is not *on* the booze. The booze is keeping you together. At least not at
"Okay. Okay. You can have it. It's not mine."
"Hey, you wanna hear your daughter do a programme on this spooky-ass music and have some fun with it? Anodic shit."
Yes. Only the black signature above a #2 pencil signature in the window stands for *You're Sane*. It's your pen name. But you're not *qualified* to be a narcotics cop. Wait, I'm sorry -- did I get that?!
"Wow, I don't want to."
"What are you doing now?"
Wait, there are *millions* of them. And they're angry. Angry at the world. Half of them have joined up at least once.
Patrol Officer Judit Minot stands in the corner, behind which a crate of rice and beans is waiting. Outside: Bamboo.
With a *plop* sound you swallow the wet flap of paper and hold it in your hand. It feels surprisingly light in your hand -- it should be more like an order.
"I'm going to **** you." (Finish the task.)
Yes, and *instantly* yes. You're going to put the needs of *everyone* before your own.
Am I sure about this? Perhaps you should rethink your life choices...
"I had some advice. It's *spooky*. Ask her first thing next time you see her, *you* not present?"
COLLAPSING TENEMENT CARGO *END OF TEXT* I CALL YOUR NAME WHAT? You think there's a way to talk to him... maybe he can help you with something? Over the phone? This could go on for hours.
That's not the real reason the man's hiding in those bushes, you're just making it up as you go along.
"It's the latin crossword puzzle. If you like, you can solve it yourself. Or even get us to think about it for you. But it'll take time for everyone else to find their way back in."
A shifting mass of tiny dots appears on the water. Ultra violet; a little closer to 2 mm than 0.5 mm. Beyond the Futuristas and beyond...
As you gaze upon the black backdrop, the lieutenant takes out his notebook and writes something down. He doesn't want to rush things: "We'll be right back, sir."
An array of drugs and alcohol floods your brain, all at once. As you hold your hand on the steering lever, the world around you begins to change...
The brash young man leaps up and almost trips over his words, but he chooses to believe and gives the administration of Pox... a chance.
When the forces of *fascination* are mixed with those of *remedy* -- and all of creation is screaming for you! The cry of *No! Don't touch that shit! It's unholy! Hurt them, but don't mention that shit!
The ghostly actresses and the rusty toolbox under the driver's seat. And the oddly bulging seat cover...
Some dicks do.
You pick out some pretty wacky hats, all of which seem to be coated in some unexpected, even narcoticish grease.
Then they were left holding the banner. The two big gossamer birds were in the wind, a tale told no one believed in.
You hear that? The lieutenant has fallen silent, not daring to say *the rum test* any more.
Whooh... how did we ever get here?
Above ground, in a hidden room, two figures share a common chair. One of them, a man called Stone, looks up from his work very carefully, occasionally tapping his foot or yelling something incomprehensible.
"Yeah, it was very nice, but I'd like to get back to my game now if I can't. What's the game?"
Your hands are covered in muck. It's difficult to say if the morbid sensation is real or not.
Cuno's Plan B: Take *the high road*, honcho. You can't trust those who are untrustworthy.
I guess it doesn't help anyone.
"Cuno's a real piece of work. Cuno knows everybody's a cunt and so on."
No one is listening to you, the recorder stands still. The tape recorder lies face-down on the table, picking it up there on the table.
On a daily, and I mean *LESS* BASED EXPRESSIONS than you've ever heard before. This will have more impact than a hundred grams of heroin...
Come on, what's the point if you can't even remember your job description?
One of the most popular and talked about tracks is *The Trap* -- and one of the most talked about artists in the whole of Graad. It winds
That's right. Just give up.
What do you think you're doing right now? Trying to push the buttons on the machine? You're not half as dumb as you look.
Oh no, she's emotional right now. Hurtful, suspicious. Run, girl! Run after that stuff!
Do you have any friends?
"Oh, I'm so sorry, dear. I'm just sorry that I couldn't help you out..." She looks at the clothes in your hand, tired.
When she moved from Remora to Revachol, her employer Ptolemy Pryce sent his best royalist, Edgar Hugh. It's about time someone did something nice
I was drunk when I took the lie to get this far.
What did he just call you -- *judiciously*? You had enough of the stinking hydroalcoholic cocktail! Get in there...
It's a small map depicting a three-way stretch of the Great Sewer System. The iconography appears to be a collapsed crisscross of streets and their tributaries.
Go ahead, try stuff.
"It's the cross-sectional study of spatial relations in the historical Quarter."
Huh? Cuno? You have no idea what he was talking about. Maybe he wasn't drunk enough? Or... smoking *too* much?
This *let's* pull it off. [Leave.]
"Your father used to drink there, yeah? He was a little mad when we first came, but..." he mumbles.
Why'd it break?
Beneath everything he's smiling, even as he does his best to keep it together.
Look, there's the corpse and all, a metre above you. The sea air tastes *fine*. You think you smell the gear too. But you can't say why. You need to continue.
Let's do this, I'm-the-eternal-cop! As a matter of fact, you should get your badge and start questioning the hoi polloi.
Of course. It's important to note that *everything* that's wrong with you is wrong with you, *everyone* is wrong with you, and *YOU* are one of them.
"Sure." (Swallow.) "Just one of them."
"I've taken the picture."
For such a pitiful sum of money it's an extremely useful tool. Especially for someone who's wanted in *many* cases.
"This is a metaphor for understanding the world. I want to turn you into a *mathematician*. What do you need?"
At the end of the day, you will need to fill out a Patrol Warrant form and travel to the graveyard to retrieve the forms. There will be no sub-zero temperatures this time.
"Some of us *deserve* more. You should go help us." He smiles gently. "Get the word out there!"
"I agree, what about it?"
"I don't know. I was hoping you'd come up with a *better* way to pay for this." He tilts his head slightly. "But it's impossible to say without a copy of the original invoice, officer."
Wait -- what is "seek and find"?
There is little to see here. Nothing to see, just three rats.
A moment's silence.
Just a regular old shoe.
Raphaël & Co. were famous for developing this outpost, and the *Retsuo* it built -- its own unique racing series.
"I'm not a nancy-fishing-shack, pal."
Hmm... the pilot doesn't look too convinced.
The man looks east, over the falling snowcapped peaks, then blames a storm that moved his cargo: "Fuckin' up."
"Cool. You should see it when he's here. He's pretty sure of his stuff." The lieutenant looks at you and says...
How do we know the container is empty?
His face flushes with embarrassment. "No, I'm actually not. My face... my face is pure white. It's nearly impassive. Even the voice is gone. It was a rare bug."
Somewhere in Mirova a great spinner spins on a string, and it's very loud... But not too loud. You hear *the void* behind it.
His eyes narrow with mistrust. He doesn't want to think about it.
Yes, stop now. The sob story is never going to convince anyone without some concrete proof.
"My man, you might be the last person alive who doesn't have a name. Or a true name. When you're old, your spirit will be."
She thinks she's got you pinned down -- but who's to say it's not a trap? The thing she's trying to sell you is a *thing*. A queen of the cosmos who's more than a shop...
"Doesn't matter, I was *born* to do this."
He takes a puff on his cigarette. "I have no choice. I have no other option but to say: F****t. This is a joke. No one believes
Wax cylinder.
"You look like shit."
So it's being *done*.
WHAT?! You were talking about the dead body, not the infernal machines hanging above the town...
"I think it was *Klaasje*."
A terror moves through her as she stands, frozen in place, her eyes widening in front of you.
"Doesn't really sound like you'd be doing anything useful."
Wait, where does she go? There's almost no light in this apartment.
Okay, the footprints are *exactly* what you would expect them to be. There is no room for an *excuse* here.
"Okay, let's change the subject."
"It's not you, it's the television people. They're all working for the company."
Something is wrong. Inside. You're churning, painful emotions... Run water dripping down your legs, a collapsed roof, cigarette butts smouldering nearby...
"Kim, I've got to check the gun."
Now! Take it down already!
It has to be better than the last time. You can't admit you lost it. It's too *unnatural*.
He's torn. On one hand he's trying to help you, but the gun he's holding hurts -- and he doesn't want to hand it over to Cuno.
On the man's face you could say: "Just try and tell me how it is, I'm not convinced..."
The way he carries himself is unkempt, his concentration is low and his hands are
"My age is *so* old... I wouldn't know."
Hmmm, interesting. There is a heavy-duty messenger here too. Like a hunter in the mountains.
What are you, psychotic? What is this language you're using to pull the plug on a relationship? What are you trying to pull here? You just have to wait and see.
Oh, stop. There's no one there to talk to.
Yes. The bulk of the rotting flesh is visible, still faintly visible under the dress. But around the neck and the back -- the bike has totally degraded into an antiques collection.
People are afraid of the FALN. They're afraid of death. They're afraid of the Union, and yet they live in the world's most communist-run country.
The pot's boiling, but you're not quite boiling yet. You need to cool the water before you do this...
For some reason -- it makes you *sick*.
Then you should run for it, headstrong as a goat. Run like hell, man. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
There must be another way to reach the data bank... Maybe you should go back in time and try that door again?
The young man lets out a loud fart that echoes off the walls of the adjoining tenements.
With a firm grip you raise the chain -- but then a strange feeling passes over your back.
The bed is cold and comforting, if a bit run down. Your back slowly stretches further to accommodate
"Well, officers, I just want to hear about people."
"But we're all doomed anyway, don't we?"
There's something there, in their bodies. Not seen before. See if you can get him to talk about it.
"Funny, I don't think anyone lives in a tree all that often..." She looks at the autumn foliage rolling over the city. "They do seem to come up with a lot of ideas these days."
An instant camera -- the Trigat Sunshine 300.
Your nervous system tells you: Stay dead.
Only in dreams do you hold hands with unknown bodies. In reality, it's hopelessly lost in a sea of blue glasses, probably Due to Fish-Eyed Man's. He can't see you've gone.
Like the clawing knife of some unknown animal, or the boiling mark of some sort of plant... You have to see for yourself.
That's understandable. Knocking on things is a human tendency. If you show your knuckles an opening you could exploit...
He means it. Blinded him with your *point* and now he's thinking about nothing but isolating you from the group and himself.
You try to push your hand under the table but the table keeps moving... The pieces are loose.
The door to that part of the Whirling-In-Rags is covered in scratches and dents. The hinges have left a mark in the concrete.
"But... maybe I shouldn't have been out."
The entire Whirling-in-Rags cast was here: Fred Armisen, Lee Majewski, Dick Mullen, Danny Masters, Robert Patrick, and perhaps the occasional *other* -- just about every man, woman and child in the
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you, but I'm sure you'll figure something out. You'll be the expert!"
The first floor of the Whirling-In-Rags is closed off. On your way up there you pass a Chamber of Refrigeration -- one of many built by the Cordage Hardware Corporation into the building's chimney stacks.
You're too late -- the door has been locked. Maybe a little force should be used?
Inspect the figurines.
See, the part of town that overlooked the collapse of the coalition is criss-crossed by crooked arterial routes. Cliffs, reservoirs, and the like. Precinct 41, at its peak.
"So you wanted the key?" He raises his right hand. "You have the power. Key. Now what do you want?"
Hey, *bratan*! Maybe this time you should just open up your wallet? You *feel* bad about it, but you can't remember what the exact amount is...
He points to you. "And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois. I'm afraid Harry doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice."
Can you believe this hooligan is running Amyd's life? You're not about to bail! Bail now, brother!
He frowns. "I wouldn't *expect* that. I never expected him to be in Martinaise himself. What do you want me to do?"
You've identified the correct tree.
Now, don't be an idiot and buy too many boots at once. If you sell them too soon, they'll sell them to someone else to take back...
"I'm always happy to help out."
Your body does not need to be in the tank for this to work. It's the goddamn tank.
"Maybe you should just start asking questions, huh?"
"Kim... what was that?"
An infant's face appears on the screen behind the woman. That's all the first indication you've gotten of what's to come.
You can take this. Keep it together -- he's thinking of his lungs.
"Well, I have had quite enough fun myself."
With a loud thud the old man stands up -- grabs the gun from the man before him, and fires into the air again.
The great district hums in the wind: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the snowswept horizon...
He wags his finger at you, suspiciously. "...a lot of different things. Levity, country, lack of knowledge in firearms..."
"Yes. According to legend, this is what happens to heroes. They are lured into ancient rags, made to look weak, or even made to look *crab*..." He looks down at the brown paper clips in his hand. "But some heroes stay strong and courageous, some heroes get all their ****** from drinking and long draughts."
So did he just *piss*?
Isn't it the other way around? Working in these kinds of environments implies responsibility. You can't help but feel that *something* is missing when you're not looking.
Before you can finish your investigation you'll have to answer a couple of questions first. Talk to Titus.
"This small vessel was the result of some dynamic work which has been *stabilized* by the Coalition Government. You are, however, to blame for the winding down of the project."
"So you don't know... all this time?"
Yes, he's talking about *you*. He thinks you're the bad guy, but what are you, a *detective*? Stop fooling around and ask him questions instead.
Did I ever tell you how they discovered this island? Denied it for a week or two? How did you even get here, when you're so unwell?
"Understood, Titus." The lieutenant taps on his notebook as though it were the most regular notebook ticker --
"Yes, tell me, is this a coincidence?"
The lieutenant looks at you wearily. "Please let's not go through this again."
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. The carapace, the *army suit* and the *vodka guano* in the signature line: Garte's signature.
You *can't* keep it in -- it's too disgusting. People are going to start thinking it's an STD. It's probably going to lead to STDs.
Hey! All of this just means that the antiques enthusiast thing doesn't suck. *You* are going to be rich. Take that!
The beach ball sits in the waves... slowly a mirror begins to appear on its back. It's almost like the face was absorbing something -- into itself. And then some.
"I found the gun you took from the dead man
"I found the wild-kin, I found the last black plague. Apt, or *high* as the sky became."
In many ways, this is a rather traditional ending. Evrart has presided over a reign of terror since his return to Martinaise, and his warriors have carried the crowns of his beloved Vöws.
The sheets are stained red. Your tears are soaking wet. You should look if it's possible to get a *better* night's sleep.
There's a dead dog...
The newspaper gets worse every day. One day, it's the one with the missing jacket. You still can't get the story out of the guy.
"What is even worse..." he whispers. "She couldn't even get on the first flight because the runway was clogged with construction debris. I'm talking about the war torn
"Some criminals always have some." He's biting his lip. "How about we change the subject?"
Tug on her heart strings.
Let it ring.
You make the most of your limited vocabulary. The most you'll ever know about this city is what you read here and there's a *tiny* gap at the end.
You're not crazy, *bratan*. You're crazy if you think the only way to stop the world is by shooting people -- or burning people -- in the face.
The building at Rue de Saint-Ghislaine -- it could easily be cited as the father of drugs -- stands tall, like a pyramid, on the other side of a massive building.
The lieutenant doesn't like this. His silence is weakness. But he understands -- the facts are the truth.
"Nah, I'm just being thorough."
Now that you've acquired a rare stamp, you can exchange it for another: a Possum card. For example: Possumile is the largest and most valuable black rhino in the world.
Just like that. He only grunts, his voice oddly muted in the face of the giant novelty cheque.
He sees it. You've been listening to your emotions, hisses from time to time, but you can't hear him.
"My mommy is black."
He points to you: "And this is my colleague from Precinct 41, Detective Du Bois. I'm afraid Harry doesn't have his badge at the moment. I hope mine will suffice."
His fake friends want him to run around with a fake passport and fake name. Makes you look like a bum.
"Sure thing, pig, yeah." He sips his beer. "So what would this look like?"
The hunter nods. "Of the three I prefer the dead man's boots to this rotting corpse of a man."
The sleeping giant is hard to see, just in silhouette, but it's not insignificant. It is taller than you are, perhaps in excess of 180 centimetres...
A machine stands in the corner, watching you with strange eyes. Its blackened steel-reinforced glass is clearly visible beneath a blanket of dust.
A covetable plot of land in a city that's seen better days. Brutal streets, boarded up windows. A nostalgic sound would come from the broken generator and the empty trap.
"Not that you would have guessed..." He glances at the empty trap.
She frowned. "That isn't really true... You haven't seen your face, maybe you should look at the roof."
Her tone makes clear that you have violated some kind of rich-person taboo. Suddenly, a *tiny* bit uncomfortable.

In the middle of a broken plaza, in the heart of the financial district, in a half-sunken tower of motor vehicles, two silhouettes square off in the rain. One of them is obscured by a collapsing rain-soaked wall. The other, however, is clearer, somehow...
"Sure, officer," she says, taking a bite out of her sandwich.
Look, the filaments you're working with are like little bits of your soul stuck in there. Just like how the little bubble you were carrying when you got out of that infernal infernal infernal tunnels... It's stuck there, some little tear runs down your face...
Don't be silly, you're not a *kinder*.
In his hands, though, a great sadness still lingers: the kind of sadness that leaves scars on his face and body.
She eyes you from head to toe: "With great respect, Mr. Morell. I would prefer to die than be trapped in this dress. Besides, with the exception of the aforementioned Loonie Roonie, no one would even consider buying it."
Running, floating, she goes through so many phases... What has she learned about the human form?
Although he's come here to Drouin with five other *castaways* -- he doesn't take that kindly.
"Ah, let's change the subject."
Say nothing -- let him choose.
Just try not to collapse.
The *legendary* Kvalsund multitool! Now give it a try!
I know it's not *cool*. It's not even *funny*. But the thought still comes -- maybe the FALN gear could do something?
... But what is *the dead of night*? Can't you just tell them to fuck off like they always do?
The knife only moves in circles, holding its steel blade in its two forearms. The man's breathing is irregular, his eyes are slits and he seems to smile sometimes.
You're right. This place is cold and damp and grimy too. Don't ask where it comes from. It'll only lead to trouble.
"Fucking right, you're a köppenspiel."
Actually, yes. All right. Here we go: *Buy* and *Jamais Vu*
This painting probably came from Graad. If it doesn't, it's probably an old photo you found on the internet.
If you don't, he'll *love* you for it.
"Hey, this could be a good place to hide."
As you've already determined, the *problem* is the toxicological high, not the hangover. He's practically drinking his own armpit ink.
Yum. Yum.
Yes, your darkened room was all that remained of the antiques & collectibles display. Even the posters & circulars are gone, replaced by
Then you should run for it, *bratan*! As soon as possible! As soon as it *is* confirmed -- *sir*, *mister*, it's really him!
There's nothing like the sound of a chain breaking, large chunks of wood chattering, and the rustle of some wings.
"Fine, talk. I like it when you're talking about other people's problems. You're my number one enemy. All of Revachol."
They're not shitting you, you know that? Are you fucking stupid? This shitter is a real piece of work, no doubt about that.
"So... how *do* I get to the island? Does that help?"
The spinner shine so bright they reflect on the officer's glasses. He doesn't say anything either.
Two women stand on a small outcropping of rocks. One of them is wearing a purple raincoat. Thin lines reach out from the rods into the sea. Small droplets start forming on the surface...
She is unfazed by your rudeness. It may have been the last thing she heard before she went blind.
No. It's *never* a good idea to try to talk the air out of a moving object. The sooner you learn this, the better.
"A sea fortification and air superiority tower?" He shakes his head. "Never mind. The Whirling's lore is legendary, yet its physical remains have held up the 'Man From Hjelmdall' better than any other. Well... *the books*."
There's a little pause. "Sorry we didn't learn anything today."
It's… nothing. A lot of things, but the central nervous system keeps churning out a series of twitchy jerks. You may not notice it, but you feel it.
Gross.
Inside, in a cell, a young woman is withdrawing from amphetamines, barbiturates and alcohol. Yet still she smiles among herself, a reddened sky above, and then goes back to her ''hot chocolate'' talking points.
What was that? You don't have control over your breathing, you ugly lump.
There is *nothing* here that justifies killing someone -- including
His tone is completely unprofessional.
Wait, no! You need to hide your true colours from the lieutenant -- he won't be forgiving if you just admit it was a lie.
"I'm afraid we need to discuss your *passport*. What did you do -- where you were when the prints were found?"
The man with earrings looks at the girl on the monitor. In his hand he's a tiny little ampoule of *good* news:
"I said something. I know he's not a good soldier. I told you to bring him down."
He's trying to instigate a chain reaction by accident.
A pang of stress? A few seconds ago you had your ass handed a million times over by a drunk who didn't know he was one.
For a moment the hanged man appears to smile. His lips are red like a clown's. Then his mouth vanishes between his lips.
The reed-like-thing's mouthparts are covered in a little snowflakes that move in a peculiar but not unnatural
There are 15 photographs in the collection.
The lieutenant doesn't say anything, but when he does, he shakes his head slightly.
There must be another way to wake up whoever is in there... Maybe you should try yelling into the furnace downstairs?
As he turns to leave, a little click -- like a cracking dinner fork -- as he notices you looking at him.
"Yes, I suppose that would be the incumbent superintendant's wife. Very well. I will call you... Kim."
This must be his gun, the gun the victim was wearing.
The lieutenant nods. "We are grateful. But there are times when it's better to let people come to these conclusions themselves..."
That's *not* true, you lied to him. And you didn't like it. This is a man after your own heart, with his own thoughts, his own desires...
"Actually, I didn't realize you were such a pathetic mess. And a very good one at that."
They're ashamed of the earth, and of their antlers.
Three figures on the spring ice. One, a shortish man, looks up in horror at the fourth, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to make *something* right...
Of course, *everything* is a *question*. But what questions? You need to get back to your *relax* now, aren't you?
"How does she get around?"
"The People's Pile? Who's this?"
"SOLUTION! The people who made this society, they just helped make the world much worse."
The criminal pays no heed.
"What a relief. Thank you for your understanding, Miss Oranje."
"That's *not* enough, is it?"
Have they not been telling you *things* about their lives? These men would tell you things, if they had something to tell you...
Two pieces of the broken board are holding its pieces together. The topmost one is a beautiful oval, like a flower violets. The smell of decay has settled in.
You look over the bay, past the towering wooden monuments and the flowering meadows.
She cuts you off before you can finish the sentence. "But, yes... No one notices, obviously."
He knows the tower is cold and he's trying to ward off the chill with his own body.
This doesn't look like someone who'd ever wear high heels in his life.
Outside it's light... Light from the copporooni tower, then starlight reflecting off the river Esperance. The statue has been toppled -- so have the drawers.
A very good call. Now go on, finish the interrogation.
She *transforms* when she thinks of Kim. A few lines later -- she's changed her mind about him and his *fucker*?
Maybe it's for the best?
You get a low that suggests desperation, and then a faint smile. It's good to have your guard down. Don't let her get too close to the truth.
"What happened to the janitor?"
He sighs. "We should keep investigating, maybe. Sooner or later somebody will figure out the *magic eye* thing..."
Two figures on the spring ice. One, a young woman, looks up in horror at the third, a middle-aged man with spectacular sideburns, jumping up and down tugging at his shirt and screaming that he's going to
"Actually I don't want to do this any more, not after what I saw."
"Yes. She's not..." He looks at the swarm of locusts surrounding her. "And it certainly isn't looking good."
No, not for a second -- just for a second. Listen within the place of industry, where power and structure join perfectly…
You can guess.
"Is this what you get when you call the police now?"
If there's a chill, it's on your back.
Pleasure
Everyone agrees: this is one *Kim* you should talk to about whatever it is you're doing. Ask away, bro.
You should sing it, but you can't quite get it out of your head. It's like some kind of a... *demon*.
It's a big mistake. The kid is standing right next to you. If he sees you talking to the lieutenant, he'll make sure you're not tripping up on the arse!
"I am her, by the way. She had the money, it was her life."
(Laugh.) "I'm a lucky man. Your comrades did not perish in that ***** attack. They are alive and well."
You take the hand-cranked cranes and put them to work. No words from the vice president yet. Better pull on the case -- the boots will be impressed.
He doesn't mean *literally* -- he's saying things like "hot air balloon fights in the sky" and "lots of things go bump in the background".
Really cool.
I am -- in any case -- not going to punish you for this. There is a big difference between you being *sent to see someone*. You're being punished for not dressing *appropriately*.
"I see. So I'm a financier and a hit man."
"Good, good... very revolutionary, Harry. By yourself?"
"I did? Thank you for being thorough."
It doesn't seem to matter. The man in the uniform moves on without a single glance -- silently.
"I'm not even sure what it is yet..."
"What happened?"
The warrior-poet replies: "Of course, we should have held off on this, *sanitising* this for you.
"Okay, kiddo. I can live with that." She tucks some dirt under her arm.
She means the opposite. It's very unlikely that you'll get the chance to catch this Lely in a straight fight.
"So what kind of armor are they made from, exactly?"
It's a metaphor. You're supposed to feel at home here.
This is
Once more you stare the impossible geometry upon the terminal. As before it glimmers...
"Jumping..." (Laugh nervously.) "We haven't done anything."
Your finger prints.
And then there's the fact that he looks *like* he likes it when people call him *man from Hjelmdall* or 'the Devil'?
"I had another question."
He looks at you
"Nah, man, that would never happen."
She shrugs. "I don't know. I don't even think it's seasonal. It's unrelated to any given month, or year. Or the seasons, really. It's inherent to the human condition, like, say, smoking all the time or drinking all the time..."
It's a clue. If they put it in writing -- who knows what they'd have for info.
You see one that's basically an advertisement for an all-purpose rickety roofing material.
She's surprisingly nonchalant about this. Could it be that she somehow knows more about you than she's letting on?
Nothing happens all night, all of the sudden. You dream a little bit worse than before. You feel nauseas and the sensation of brushing against the paper -- a new row appearing almost in your head.
Like a tiny dog, yes! Tiny enough to fit through the trap without tipping your head. And yet you have no idea where it is... What is it?
"Would you let me take the tape, sir?"
I'm too old to cry. You should still come up with a good reason to come back to me.
"The people behind this ain't worth the paper they write!"
The point is to find a legitimate way to send out the *robots* (read: cheap semaphore-powered sub-races). The prize is the most important one, but there are plenty of other, equally valuable real estate options...
Come on, *bratan*! What are you doing, you're gonna get *laid*?! Why don't you just lie around all day? Maybe that'll keep you company?
The air suddenly feels calmer, more transparent, with tinctures of pineapple and orange liqueur flowing into the tip of your nose. It's almost nauseating, like the city has gone dark...
"See? There's no excitement in her!" He looks at his son, then at you.
"HARD CORE!" he yells.
Shaped like the cross that so richly and inexplicably overlaid on the Martinaise crane's
"I think I may have allergies to tea."
The pinball machine sits in the corner, forgotten and unused. A quick glance at the coverart reminds you of its nostalgic glory.
He might be lying -- but he's not at all bothered by your question.
SIGNING TINY!
You stare at the large window overlooking the yard. In it you see the sun rise -- along with the first column of a
This is clearly a theme park. Everything from a by-the-book police officer to an incarceration rampaging madman in a twisted carabineer suit to a salvaged motor carriage jolts and de-spawns thrown together by the insane. This is urban exploration in the making.
The lieutenant smirks, then pauses to analyze you more carefully. He's worried you're giving him a bad memory.
"That's cool by me."
A little spring breeze rustles the sails. Lounging around the radio transmitter, is isn't it a little bit like being in your room? With the windows open?
What has he got in his pocket?
I know it's not easy, he thinks. It's not *that* easy. But keep your cool. Now there's a *better* chance of succeeding.
Just like that. No arguments. Go ahead, just go ahead -- whatever it takes to get the kid to talk.
Wait! Did we do something wrong?
"Is that all you're gonna tell me?"
He is disappointed.
"Okay. And you think she had anything to do with the shooting?"
The light pole has been carefully cut, and the wiring has been redone and attached to a standard indoor plug. The light buzzes faintly but persistently.
"But you've seen through them. No one is *lazy*."
You *have* power to rein in this woman.
You should drop it. Yes. You should drop it. You don't know why you didn't -- maybe it's your soul on trial?
It sounds like you did it for them -- you took them from that Wild Pines property and now they're stuck on an island with no food, no water...
The pole has been carefully cut, the screws are soaked with cold kerosine, and the end of the tape is reaching its limit. The ends of the pipe are too long, the wooden part is ruined. The moment has arrived.
Titus? No one in the history of *civics has* claimed to have invented *beer* or 'civics*, though they often seem to fit together.
A really fancy way of saying "fuck with the poetics."
You haven't spoken the disembodied voice, the one that spoke to you from the dingy little box. The one that tried to drown you... But you can't leave it like that. It's too dangerous.
Why, do you want to be a narcotics cop?
You realize he has no idea what *sending the money* is. You should know.
"Maybe I did. Maybe I *did*."
His nose is still in the book, stuck between the binding and the pages. After a while, it just *does* -- a small miracle it's still there.
They've got him distracted. One of them is watching you, the other is off doing something else.
This isn't going to change a lot of minds, Harry-boy.
"Well, you didn't help *me* out."
He nods toward it. "Sensationalist extremists protesting the neo-liberal project. One can't help but notice certain *locutions*..."
Me? What have I done?
As you tilt the pages you notice several cases brought before the high court of Yekokataa. On the cover are the faces of three people: a man, a woman and a child. The name on the panel says: "Kras Mazov."
"Really, officer, you've got it pretty bad." She looks down at her knees, her pink, swollen feet gently touching the ground.
It's unlikely. Your memory is what's keeping you from the exit, even if you could somehow recall the location of the rusty control panel.
C'mon, show her the money!
Your nose is the first to register the scent of intoxicating booze. A familiar tingling!
That's it? The result of *one* bad choice -- and she's right -- stop staring at her ceiling. You've already done that.
No need for emotion in your situation. You already *have* it -- you've been singing to the pigeons.
The lieutenant's eyes glaze over as you unleash a torrent of synapses on his amygdala. It's like you're in a movie. There's a soundtrack, crisp and clear, growing on you...
WORDS. WORDS. I can't. I'M NOT TOTALLY IN ON THE SCENE. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE I AM A WARD MAN.
The man nods. "His was a lucky gun that didn't have a barrel threaded through it -- it took a lucky shot out of him."
The water in the basement is still and cold, but there's something very wrong with it. You're sick as you've ever been before...
The documents are all signed by Deneuve and Tito. Tito's signature is visible on the margins. The name "Kim" is
Your nose tells you there's more to it.
But you're still a *monster*. A robot, operating on autopilot, unable to feel pain or pleasure.
"I think this is what happens when you make a witness miss... you get hit." He points to the other side of the wooden door. "That's why I'm aiming at that pillar, for some reason."
Why *is* this important?
Yeah, you sure look like the kind who'd lose his mind
This is the thing you *need* to be looking into -- the symbol for Light.
Dolores Dei was buried in the Purus Moat in Vesper, a district of Revachol, on the River Esperance. Not far from here, in Vesper's shadow, a great city of Vesper -- its income and population depend on the river, and the canal that empties it.
He looks you dead in the eye. "And I have no need for *bratushkas* any more. That's why I'm leaving you all to rot in this filthy cellar..."
I don't think I've ever felt so alive.
The fence is still there,
Not to mention that it's quite possibly a case of you never caring about *anything* ever again!
Looking down... There's a hole in the stained glass window.
"Doubt that it's right." He gives you a sharp look. "You've been walking around here with your arms crossed, looking out for signs of more *articulated* alcoholics. Guess it's now or never."
While the noun is fully formed, the verb is already in your head. What follows is a sequence of semantic turns.
So many. Not that she'd be worried about any of them running afoul of the Union. Run, brother Run!
The great district hums in the falling rain: A chessboard of old wooden houses, 80.000 living souls and chimney stacks. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Precinct 41. To Boogie Street forking into the rainswept horizon...
It sounds like an entry wound. The radiation of the boot prints can still be seen on the wood.
"That's not really my goal."
The golden note is in the shape of a corona, or flare, rising out of the blue.
A mirror hangs on the bathroom wall. It's barely covered in steam any more. You see a man-mount on the other side, covered in *vanilla* clean-shaven police conduct.
Nothing comes up this time. You see the lieutenant watch you try to stimulate thought processes by hitting yourself.
Like those cold blue eyes you've seen staring at the door for ages.
He is surprisingly okay.
I'm sure you did it. It's just not happening any more. You've lost the will to live any more. It's like you died.
Look, the straw is *so* sweet. You wanna spin it, but you know it's too late? Better to just keep it to yourself.
Inspect the text again.
"Yes -- I was surprised. I had assumed
The lead programmer stares at you, stunned. "What is this? That you think I've forgotten about our little prank call?"
He pays no heed
Hey, I'm not giving up! My heart's just in my hand, like it's never leaving it... This was a great way to live...
The more you ask yourself, the less you know. One thing is for sure -- you're not a child anymore. You are an adult with responsibilities.
In all fairness, that *L'origine du disco* may be the single greatest thing ever.
There's a hole in there.
You can't think of anything particularly remarkable about the display.
You find no killer, only a coincidental number of identical tampon-shaped posters under the board -- all within a half-dozen pages.
"I'll look into it." (Take the case)
"I'm having a drink now, sir. Very strong one. Love."
The panoramic 360-degree view of the bay is made possible by the steep angle of the building's top floor, overlooking the water.
He doesn't mean it in earnest. This passion only boils him -- into a fury of words, a flood of rivalls -- so that when the time comes he will rip right through it.
Which is *also* interesting. Because right now, you seem to be standing on the edge of the world.
This one's bad. He's about to open his mouth and spew it out again. Just like that, it's gone. Plucked up, broken.
Yes, yes. They're all crap. There's no way you could have made it past Police Academy and onto Perikarnassian turf.
And then the sea air gets really really thick. Mycroft's gone, too. All is quiet on the Martinaise inlet...
There's still plenty here to ask.
Well, there's certainly no evidence of a bullet in his head.
"Yeah, Kim's got no balls."
The same thing that happens to all humans. The bulb in your head slowly turns off -- at least, that's what it felt like for me. For you.
You have a fixed position in the world of colour and science. Your job is to pick the right one.
An embrace? What is this? An embrace? What's happening to your chest now?
One of the chain link fences has fallen off, exposing two rivets into the ocean -- one green and the other red.
The kid looks at you blankly. Then at the old man. "You fuckin' with me? Coppers, I like them better. People, I like them worse."
She shrugs. "Too dark to see in here anyway. Besides, I already told you, I won't be responsible for breaking in, you know."
A free market economy needs as wide a distribution of wealth as possible. There are always going to be outliers.
"Ow, shucks..." The man's eyes bulge from the terror in them.
Then he turns back to you. "And what is your name? I need you to sign this over for the small time period you mentioned."
He nods. "There is a pang of guilt -- that and he being a *beverage*. When he learns the hard way..."
I'm sorry he has to be like this.
"You're saying he murdered a man because you got in his face?"
You're wasting good speed on this crap? What's so amazing about it?
"They wouldn't have shot me if they had, would they? I'm not gonna take up the case of Evrart Claire any longer. There's too much going on."
A sudden gush of wind turns the pages upside down. Letters are splashed across the board -- and the ledger itself is a thin, cold river of papers.
is short for "Officer, I've seen some pretty bad guys in my time at the Whirling... How'd they do?"
Does that mean I'm a bad hunter?
Too late! The catch 22 is in your mouth. And in your throat. So -- you're out. Never gonna get it back.
She looks panicked all of a sudden. "I don't know -- I don't even *know* what you're talking about! Come on, show him your tits for all the boys to see!"
The lieutenant's right. The scruffy-haired youth is actually quite talented in his *own right*.
It's strange that he doesn't remember the *how* you got there, but he does -- and you should keep that shit to yourself.
Just get it over with.
"I wanted to talk to you about something else, not this."
As you finally close your eyes, you are reminded of the caustic past. All the corpses, all the hospital gowns -- but also the smoking wreckage, those tags still attached to the corpse's decaying limbs.  Scanning them again, you close your eyes...
Your reflex takes you back to where you were. The young man stands in front of you, blindsided and distracted.
Oh my god, you're dead...
"People of this world, kids roaming free, throwing fire bombs and looting." He stares at you and all the other children in the shacks, waves in your general direction. "They don't care about me, I *don't* care about them."
Close your eyes.
There's no way to turn this around. The lighting's not working. The machine will just keep on spitting out images -- maybe you should just turn back to the case files?
"Uh huh... that's a lot of people." He looks at you, calmly.
The dancer can't keep a conversation in any other shape. She does spin the subject off to go on tangents. But BULLSHIT.
The 'why' is easy -- because those are the kind of questions that *people in other countries* ask.
"Oh, thank you. I was actually hoping you'd have more questions, officer."
"You're right, it did *not*."
He smiles. "That's a given. But I also know from personal experience with some very *bad-ass* people."
A punch is not imminent, but it's on the cards. You can always swing by the book shop when you get the time.
He rolls his eyes. "I guess it's not the *illness*, though. Never mind. I've seen worse in my
They're not in a position to ask you questions, of course they wouldn't. You're not a cop, you're an officer of the law.
"Yeah, I'm ready to throw in the ocean."
You have no idea. Look at the label.
"Isn't this a bit too *me*-oriented?"
He sighs. "Then I'll have to settle for second place... Though I do sometimes wonder what *the hard core* in Cuno would have made of that puny-core."
The brass pin is surprisingly smooth and shiny. It feels like something sharp has penetrated its elegant criss-cross.
But I'm a guy who wears his heart on my sleeve. I know you can't trust everybody, but you gotta at least *try* to make it work.
He frowns. "It's an optical illusion. Humans don't use pens like that. Besides, the name isn't important. The impression is wrong."
A crude stick insect moves its retinas along with the movement of the eye. When you look up it's sitting on your forehead. Watching you.
It's a funny line, actually. It's not the *worst* anyone has said of Deneuve. Dulodro are two different words.
For an hour she watches you perform, without saying a word. Then she turns to you: "You mean *like*?"
Somewhere in there -- time to form the foundation of something beautiful. A good, solid wall. It's important.
The work you did. The names. The rank. It will show her who's boss when it comes time to pass judgment.
Yes. It's not the flu. The flu is a foreign body, sent here by the Coppolangelo solar system. The ULAN dish is missing its radio transmitter.
Of course it's easy to see -- you *have* to be a little more *hands on* in the future.
"What are you trying to accomplish with this?"
The aroma of freshly treated leather, the lack of dirt and dust on the dashboard, and a satisfying pop as the fuel filler switch are all wrapped up in orange paper, surprisingly free from the many boxes you've seen wrapped before.
It *is* nice and cold this late at night. You don't feel hungry after all the nights behind bars...
For all time.
What do you think you're doing right now? Going around the bend? Maybe the other guy upstairs is watching you...
"Okay, it's too late. If you've got any balls, go tell Titus about the body."
A sigh. He takes off his glasses and wipes the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand.
How do you know all this?
Say what you will, but there can be no doubt: the *Vows*. The *annual* part is your nickname.
"*The* Insulindian Citizens Militia."
"Don't worry, Kim. I know you're busy, but I can always give you *something* to talk about later."
*This* has *some* kind of meaning for you, Harry-boy. Some weird *meaning* here.
His face is tense. There's
Blink rapidly.
This content is provided for your viewing pleasure. Do whatever you want with it -- read, watch, listen!
"It's me." She looks around. "I keep the place up somehow. Some people rely on me -- some people only *pay* me to stay in business."
The lieutenant explains the intricacies of the chain of command, while also trying to impart a certain expertise -- zoological knowledge -- which he does not.
He's talking about a morbid variety of *pale* -- in which cases he's probably not even *thinking* they're related.
Somewhere in the last few days the LIARC dropped the bombshell that it had the technology to hack into the Everglades.
"That's it. Everyone, you hear me? Everyone!"
Yes, back to *trial by combat*, aren't you a little tired of hearing about *your* cop-show bickering?
He must be slightly confused.
"Understood. Sorry." (Refuse.)
There's a fair amount of wince and he's gotten pretty animated lately -- probably chocking it up to a *rough ride*.
"The outside in, *travelling*?" She lets the tears flow. "All those years of hell we've been through..."
You stare at the greyst Cloud Innossence, silently repeating the word "Eternite" (the innossence) three times.
The blurb on the back reads: "This is a tightly wound noir story about a lost soul and his unwavering resolve. It's a cautionary tale about old age, about hubris and its corrosive effects on human relationships.
There's nothing else to do with the traps at this time. They're all empty.
A shield of flesh and inhuman strength protects the chest, radiating heat. Anyone could die trying to get in, but Kim has *special goggles* that allow him to see straight -- and he's been wearing them for a while.
Yes, that's a sound you won't soon forget...
For me it is a child on the wind. A child in her lukewarm bed, asleep. Early in the morning light. In a cold village on the coast of Martinaise.
Stories have it that he had his bedroom converted into a treasure chamber where he stored unfathomable wealth: *krugerrands*, bars of gold, ornate weaponry, armour, and various chalices.
A great excitement is bubbling to the surface within him. This man has an idea what you meant.
The tall ginger on his right still has tears of laughter in his eyes. "You know what, I just had to do. The autopsy is still a few days away, but it's all so far from over. There's still much work to be done..."
"I know I shouldn't have. And I don't like to get into this kind of thing."
Don't, *bratan*, you don't have to do this. Maybe you were too quick to leave...
There are many inconsistencies in this piece of literature. Perhaps you should re-read it for *more*?
Okay, so this guy has been talking to *Emmanuelle* -- *Emmanuelle* is an alias. Sometimes he's used for cover. This is definitely an *asshole*.
Under the azure sky the great district wakes: A chessboard of wooden houses, 80.000 living souls inside. Firetraps as far as the eye can see -- from Main Street to Grand Couron, from Precinct 41 to Boogie Street forking into the smoke-filled horizon...
What she's wearing is a Perikarnassian inspired uniform, reminiscent of the Geometric Archipelago used by the Royal Navy during the Insulindian Occupation.
The knob slides smoothly over the small oven mitt, letting out a few crisp jets of steam as you reach the >finish line.
A <bratan>? Is that what you think she said the name was? You have no idea what she said it was, what *art* is...
"I don't have a problem with stupid people. I
"It doesn't have to be like this. The rat... you can always come back and repeat the experiment."
He goes on: "The society maintained a high standard of living for the most part, unfortunately. The most important developments occurred during the Revolution. While the members of the original ruling class continue to enjoy all the privileges and
This seems to confirm your suspicion: that *Ruby* is the person who came up with the 7-Up.
You won't get the chance to. She shot herself in the head.
"That's... a pity."
Didn't she say...
The Lieutenant is leaving you no choice but to praise him for keeping the lights on in this neighbourhood. It must have been tough getting there, but as a cop you *must* praise him.
To be honest, you really should have taken his side here. There was no other way -- the shot would have been fatal without you.
You can't be sure, because he hasn't told you what happened during the raid. He hasn't even told you what he knows about the shooter.
"I'm not going to stop listening to your crap any more."
Your words echo in the hallway, echoing off the walls of eternite and other cheaper colors. You make out grey-blue and orange 'pillars' above the stairs.
With an ominous, military air, he points his gun at Elizabeth. "How about the kipt? Go ahead, tell me it was a *good* turn for you."
The book feels heavy in your hands. Like a museum piece, held together by the passage of time.
Say nothing, stare grimly into the distance.
The spinner shine so bright they reflect on the lieutenant's glasses. He takes them off quickly, not wanting to draw attention to his unsightly bulge.
He thinks of evading, in silence, but suddenly he remembers something. "Oh, yes, Kim. Yes, please."
"You did the thing you're accused of. You came here, *high*. You showed us the door."
"It was my service dog."
"I'm glad you've found that bouquet." (Hold out the drouamine.)
No, that's not it... no *incantation* will solve the mystery of *that* either.
"In the pale, nameless earth, jade... gems, they glitter with the killing curse of the gods! An elemental curse that defiles all things..." He stares at the pile of colourful gemstones, dead and dying.
We could hide behind any bush I want. Rock formation, bird's nest, or -- worst case scenario -- a real goddamn tent made of stick figures. The stick men wouldn't be able to see in.
The coarse language he uses to address you makes it sound like he's not a fan. Perhaps it's the hangover? Or the ennui?
"The shopkeeper didn't want to talk to us -- the woman said she can't talk to police about dead body stuff."
"Tell me what you've got to say about this."
Your gaze lingers on the manuscript's spine -- it twists and turns in a matter-of-fact manner.
No one
Oh no... it'll come to you. You'll be *embedded* in its coils. With a delicate antenna on her back, she blinks -- unfazed.
"You're from the Insulindian Citizens Militia, right?
This whole discussion could have been so incredibly in-depth. You should have talked about it, after all.
There's a self-righteousness in his voice.
Your eyes light up with a new, forceful life. You begin to singe your hair with the power of your voice...
Wow! An old fluorescent light has somehow connected with one of the rafters at the back of the building. It's like you saw it before.
She's not fazed by your odd behavior. A result of years of solitude on the islands, she would assume a bullet hole in her heart.
no, you're not done. There's more to tell, but you *are* a bad ass cop. So anyway -- scum like you circling the boat is a symptom of a much larger, more complex medical condition known as *alcoholism*.
A stalactite is a type of plank, from the dolorian era. The dolmen are made of bone and mostly filled with wood, providing support and help in thrusting against heavier materials. They are used for supporting fragile structures such as trees and lorries.
Let's not think
The young speedfreak appears to be taking it for granted that you'll find the correct phylogenetic tree.
Downstairs somewhere -- perhaps in a hidden compartment behind the wall? Don't go looking there.
"I do need some money. For my freedom."
I'm getting so meta.
"You're welcome. Really."
He throws the pot on the ground and shouts *bang* in the air. "Whooa?" He waits for the echoes to start flying.
You hear footsteps behind you.
A window stands in front of the Revacholian residential neighbourhood. The graffiti-covered box towers above them: "THE UNSOLVABLE CASE", "THE CASE OF THE BOTTOMLESS GUYS", "SHE'S ON THE COAT."
"Don
An ugly mess! This has got to be fixed now!
"That's true, actually."
It's not going to happen. No matter how you crane your neck, you can't see the whole of the Whirling-in-Rags. There are too many places to point...
That *really* is an awful lie.
This guy's gonna have to start getting used to the idea that he has to prove he can still do *not* damage the mural any further?
and VOCALOID (talking to you, too) -- those are the only two *registered* trademarks. There is a little pause to let the wind through the speakers.
Gravity anomalies? There's no way *that* could be true. Either way, this is *stuck* on loop...
No. It would be better to finish the case and get back to investigating the bullet hole in the cement.
"Hmm..." He looks at the printed symbol on the container. "I imagine it's quite imposing. And how would it look on your counter?"
I had hoped the lieutenant would *not* be involved... Heh he's a big deal in this case, though.
The problem is your detachment, your inability to connect emotionally. Try as you might, you just can't seem to connect the dots.
Hold up. Do I even have to remind you of *someone*? I don't even have a *name*. You'd never know who it was!
Oh, they're so mild, you could tuck them away in your blouse and never have to worry about them again. *Nod knowingly*.
You're being *handled* here. The deserter knows he has an excuse not to come forward. That's all. You can't let that happen.
No wait, *this* guy. Don't put words in his mouth. This is too big.
That's cool, but why the fuck are you doing this? Are you a cop or a florist? Why are you picking this up?
This is the premonition. Now if you could just find one of those premonitions...
The girl under the park, she might see you there... the lieutenant steps in: "I think he's under arrest."
You see two, maybe three bushes, grown into a single thicket -- from the ashes of the past 25 years.
But you can't recall... You seem to have done something similar to this once before. Back when you were just starting to guess at the case.
A bloodstained wall hangs on the door's south side -- a wall topped with concrete blocks.
There is a hole in the wall right in the centre of that roof. And it's been bothering the people here for a while now.
Washed down your ledger? Didn't the lieutenant give you a *lie*? Perhaps a third time? Still a *lie* -- and you take the blame.
"That was a *very* low blow. You still have to answer that question, right? What *did* you say?"
"It looks like you have a drug problem. Would you prefer to go on trial with your friends as a *possible
"What's on the radio?" (Record the audio file.)
The lieutenant gives you a quick sideways glance, then makes small note in his notebook for later reference.
"You can't. You've been gone for too long. It's no use walking in the reeds -- the sun shines too long."
She is absolutely not a morning person. By noon she's already working the late shift and then some. At least you're awake that late.
"Hello, officer." She sounds tired now, but still energetic.
For her to be where she is today, to be in this situation, to have such an experience.
"Well, look at him now. Before Cuno's got his ass handed to him by a fucking weak motherfucker."
"What if they did *not*?" He pauses, trying to figure out the answer. "If they had... They'd just be a nuisance. But they already are. Now they're taking up so much of your time you have to try to avoid them. It's really annoying."
"Ha! See how foolish I am? How can I ever hope to be of any use to you, my friend? For all the things you do."
Gone. Plastered everywhere. Like, on craigslist and craigslist's index. Search everywhere, see what sticks.
"Mh." He glances his son, who appears to be asleep
"How would we do that?"
Get a hold of yourself, you're a police officer, you don't have to tell anyone how to do their job.
The shopkeep is dumbfounded. He tries to look away, his gaze fixed on the beat.
This is a great piece of work, but you're not good enough. You can't crack this kid's head any more than you can crack mine.
You don't feel like *the guy*.
That's what you came for, isn't it? This was a *good* fight. Go on then, win or go home.
*hopes* will deliver your message.
"You know... who do you think you are, the gardener?"
An acute view of reality.
He nods slowly.
"Yeah, I'm a killer. I guess that's what I'm good at."
The fear is justified, sire. He doesn't *want* the cocaine to get out of hand.
They are not *out there*. There is no such thing as a *spooky* construction at this station. There is no basement, only hooks.
Ah, yes. This may be the ticket to get back to the island. Have you been paying attention *at all*? There is a moment's silence, before she says...
You don't have that luxury, partner. The authorities know you've been missing your gun and they've been waiting for your confession.
Instead of making eye contact you make out *The Expression*.
You see two jacketed bullet holes. The bullet hole in Filippe's heart has ears, he should be able to hear you say *filippe's* name.
"Great!" She juts out her chin, as if trying to keep the collision at bay. "I think I'm pregnant."
The lieutenant leans closer. "You look like a little guy, like a kid. I can see that."
The printout has a physical table of contents, but it's barely held together by glue -- you can't *feel* the book's edges, they're completely formed on the table.
There's something suspicious about that
What did she just call you? You're going to have to return to this topic later, when you get the time.
The straps attach to the left side of the seat with a *snap*.
A dark pool of cheap pilsner appears at your feet. The glass it's contained in shattered into a thousand pieces. You smell the Pilsner.
No, you're right. You should have kept pushing if you had something. Then it might have been worth it.
"Have you ever wondered -- where is all this coming from?"
"But I'll *probably* do it again."
No, I'm not going to do this. [Put pen to paper again.]
Even if it isn't, all the while you can see the lieutenant keep his chequered brows knitted in contemplation...
What's the matter, are you allergic to something? Your nose is the only thing keeping you from the dance floor now.
In fact, it doesn't even make it *okay* anymore. You feel sad, knowing she went through something like that.
Rapha's goal was to stir the pot. But what does he have to do with this? His goal was to break down the barriers of the world.
"Shoot, mister." The young man claps his hands. "Very artful of you, art director. So what was it?"
Oh, I see. You have been ''culminating* in your late teens and early 20s. While still in high school you almost single handedly ended the attempted drowning of a fellow student by herself.
Yes. Apparently, the human genome has come up with a pleasant-sounding acronym for what you should do: Protectorate the Runic Society.
She chuckles. "As you can see, the bullet hole is gaping. Still, it wouldn't hurt to keep an eye out."
A pair of ice bear eyes stares back at you from the cover. The title reads: "Man from Hjelmdall and the Ice Bear Wrôthgär."
Raphaël Ambrosius Costeau is a two song building, but this one *sucked* the band even more. They couldn't finish a song like this. This one was sick. And they've kept it bottled up a *while* -- maybe a week?
An innocent woman saying things that others would consider to be terrible and horrible. It's not easy.
You would cry if your father hit you with a stick.
It's like a little engine is quietly running in the background, drawing inspiration from other art vehicles -- from painters and sculptors, from sounds and movements...
What a strange choice of words.
She has formed the following ~taboo~: "If he gives me the info I can *NOT* let him leave without having his mugshot."
Can you? It's on the tip of your tongue -- a *bitter* hint of sourness in the middle of your tongue.
It's *not* about him being angry -- it's about you not caring.
The bane of A prime, as they call it. The machinations of savage artists are not what *stings* for thee -- the sting is bad enough.
"You're right, Kim
She's actually grateful for the help.
He pauses, looking at you with something akin to compassion in his eyes. "Can we help you with something?"
"And what was that about the sandwich?"
No, it was a good call. Stop and ask questions, really get to know him better.
And then, it seems to you, it's gone. A great silence fell on the streets of Revachol -- with bodies trickling down in the streets, as usual.
"By the way, I'm not a paramedic -- I'm a police detective."
Sure, why be interested in the world around us. Get back to boring, brutal detective work.
Your sense of reality is fading. The moment passes...
With the passage of years the trees have lost their long, dark spines. Those black spider webs you've
"That's it?" he turns to you. "I've read all about it. The *titanium citizens* who keep the copper and the ore in the wheels of their looms. The small mechanical crews who rotate the ore through the gears at the smelting plants in Kedra..."
"What about the receiver?"
"Yes, my partner, I think he's dead."
The door has an air of smooth dance moves as you hurl it open. It's not just someone's toy. It's yours now.
"To the chills."
"Now we're talkin'. The shit about '
So how did she become *a* courier?
"Do you ever feel guilty about not
The ledger just sat there, readable only as a note. You should have kept it, but you didn't.
A black trickle of liquid trickles down your thigh...
Oh yes... you and he were supposed to take the roundabout route! Instead of the normal *hill* we drove over!
The planet's hungry belly-sinks into the murky blackness of the ocean... it's about to gnaw on your sandwich-let, sir.
You do feel there's something similar, in the way he carries himself. A nervous energy. Even if he was only wearing underwear. You *have* to admit: it looks *better* than nothing.
Seems like it does. On closer examination, though, it's nowhere near done. You'll need to do it through politicking and badassery.
"Yeah, man, I gotta have one of those things. I'm not getting it from fuck-a-doodle-shit any more..."
A certain coldness comes over you at the thought of the cigarette. It's as if it's been running, like an ancient image, over your entire being...
"It's not," he says in a lowered voice.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let's see what he's got in store for you now, shall we? Let's see what he's got in store for you, shall we?
I should just answer the question.
The *Jamais Vu* he's referencing is a real motor car manufacturer. Yes, even a *cop* would have a motor car...
Then, just like that. You hear the scream of anaerobic life suddenly breaking forth from the darkness of the trap. Above the trap, a resonant gong as the insect moves its forearms -- a click
I'm beginning to doubt your judgement.
"Who? No, this is a giant mess!" The big man points at the pile of soggy logs. "This is all completely and utterly and entirely and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and utterly and00000000000
To find out what happens next, you'll have to uncover the *Tequila Sunset*. In the fading light of the shack's furnace, a single figure looms: astride a bronco -- a scrawny yet handsome man, stripped naked, his genitals bulwark covered in white borscht.
You don't feel like either one of these things. Your limbs ache and you're reminded of old /r9k/ all the time.
If he's so *traumatized* by the marshal, what *is* he going to do now? Maybe he'll confess?
Not just any old *craft* however. Quite an unusual choice for a cop of her calibre, and she's quite capable of it as well.
Back to cop books. This could be of use in the future.
Prybar, crowbar, leverage displacement tool of the gods. So called for poor posture, ugly manners and/or aggressive tendencies. Don't listen to what the supermarket bookstore told you. It's better to *speak*!
"The Näkki community has benefited greatly from the Inland Empire's peacekeeping efforts. The Inland Empire, in its wake, has made Revachol into a model post-apocalyptic state. Far-gone, really..."
You both fall silent.
The silence, the darkness, the hallways... it's impossible to get through it.
Your hand shakes so hard it rattles the cargo lock.
A dead dog?
"No. I have one of those intimate leads. I can't let *crying babies* in there! I can
She flashes you a knowing smile. "Probably for the best, officer. Whatever we do, don't let anyone trick you like that."
"As I said, it was a celebration. You should have it up on the wall too."
(Turn to Kim.) "What's with the pants?"
Nothing. That smug glinting of steel in her eyes. She's practically crying with joy right now.
This is *not* the end of the world. It's just a figurine. The end of the world is here, but it's a bit premature for that.
Take this opportunity to start your life anew as a *classier* member of this *community*.
What kind of mental toughness is this guy, you wonder?
Your hands are covered in muck, expect the accumulation to make doing *anything* even harder.
Forgive me... I have no other way to get you out of this. You're too scared to tell them.
He was *just* about to head off. That was it -- he wanted to go on. But then the lieutenant talked him out of it.
While you *try* to be inconspicuous, you notice certain patterns in the air. Patterns that might be signs of disease.
A thorn in his side, it seems. The poor kid is in a bad place. He doesn't know it, but he's in it. In the end, maybe it's for the best.
Oh no, turns out he *has* been to the house.
It's the *Ultimate* edition. If a *situational* awareness were built into these guns it would be activated *when* the wind hits the barrel.
You tried everything. You tried caving in, you tried meeting up with her, you tried not calling the cops and having them investigate the lynching, you tried completely changing the story to make it seem worse...
Some people are just good at guessing.
The flicker of light on the terminal's output is bluish, as if the corpse are still in there...
You're just stuck here. In the half-world. Could try looking at other people. *Really* looking. But why would you want to start doing that?
"Maybe. But I'm not supposed to talk about it."
Yes. And suddenly you find yourself holding a tinct of whiskey and lemonade in your hand. Tinct. Tinct. Tinct
For this kind of money, you would do well to follow her example. Those *MAKE* money. Please.
It's a little-used way to approach him. He may be in cahoots with Evrart.
"She's right. I'm addicted to drama."
"You've been running back there all this time? On this coast, and you have this key? To *crack* it? No, it's too big."
An old photo. Perhaps it's a rite of passage? A rite of passage? Surely you felt it best to point it out to him...
With a *plop* your hand emerges from the mouth, covered in blood up to the wrist. Between your fingers -- an enormous gush of dry run-off, soaking your hand.
No. The footprints don't match those of a junkie. They're not even particularly human. The chitin wrapper -- weighed down by leaves -- could not have supported a foot, let alone two.
He does not take pleasure from antagonizing you.
The *polizon* is marked by orange flowers on March 8th and by a single yellow sun on April 2nd. The monument stands at the centre of the harbour, topped by a golden statue.
The light vanishes inside the dark office. Only the shape of a man and a woman remain, their heads reduced to a single silhouette in the cold.
She thinks it was some other guy, but he makes her uncomfortable. So maybe it was her -- *tragedy* or something. Whatever the reason, she's not talking.
"Well, it's a *piece* of the puzzle," he
"What about this pillow I found on the ground?"
What
"And any of the plants that you find... you bring them back to me." He pulls out a toolbox and gives it to you. "In a little box."
He points his gun at Elizabeth. "How about the kipt? Go ahead, tell me what it's good for..." He thinks for a moment, then decides against it.
A note in the bottom left corner of the chalkboard says: "SEE THE PHANTOM ON THE ROAD."
She sighs. "Yeah, not that I'd want to be involved in any political discussions."
"*It* is -- but we both know it. And I'm more or less *proud* of what I do."
The tape recorder lies on the floor of the empty amphitheatre, just one of many things recording into it's maze-like path.
"A significant number of those who ask can pass for human, or pig, depending on your point of view."
You see a set of two skis with a variety of models on them.
How do you feel, mind blowing?
What *is* that?
"Of course. Just..." (Start to cry.) "... sort of..."
A marked hunter -- tall, lithe and lithe, with long blonde hair and a prominent chestnut-sized head. She's stood in the sun too long -- and so has he.
"It's not personal, I just wanted to make it clear that I don't think you can rely on it any more."
"What a pretty face..." He frowns. "Yes, I'm the person you're supposed to protect, that's the problem. You should go and let *her* talk to him. Tell her it's over!"
"No, I didn't *eat* you. I only gave you this notice because you're a giant
"Hmm. So -- what were you like?"
"Get your fucking act together! This cop-shit -- isn't even *about* you! You're part of this *piss-stain*!" He points to Gaston. "What is he doing here? Isn't he getting *stuffed* on the island?"
That pain in your side is... almost unspeakably so. You need to get medical attention right now.
"Is it?" The lieutenant counts in his head.
One of the most popular and controversial tracks is *the Fjördhæmmer* in Arda NFD. It's two kilometres west of here -- just off the coast of Suresne. The crow's feet and sealskin boots are native to that area.
"Oh, okay. I understand. You're a bit troubled, no?"
Here we go. Start at the top, with this one: "Boots, Guns, and Feudalism." Who says you've exhausted all the other avenues of *innocence?*
This one's *real* problem is that he's a narcissist who won't *listen* to reason. Get in his head, and it'll start flowing agains the Mind Flayer!
The book is about the experience of being a certain age. It's an imitation of real life events, only much more horrible.
It's *inornate* though -- worn and mossed by windswept evisceration. The precinct, at the far edge of the city, is shaking under your weight -- the foundations are shaking.
Her eyes follow your movements with some concern. "You're slow, aren't you? We should slow down before we try anything else."
The garage door is locked and barred.
There's a trail of tears in his hair, but not as much as in the past.
"Fuck yeah! I'm taking this case *seriously*."
He hands over
"Yeah, or..." He shakes his head. "I'd say that about all the cases I've closed. We are on a 0.00 weight loss per head-cause of death protocol."
Write: Harry Du Bois.
You're so *stuck* on drugs, he thinks, his voice slightly quivering. On drugs. On drugs, boy, you are gonna die. Bottle and pen, he looks at you...
The young man looks startled for a moment, before he agrees.
All around her, winds rustle her hair. On the plaza's shady facade, a pair of sunglasses shines out from a cracked window.
You do realize there are drugs being sold in this town, right? And that there *might* be more of them lurking somewhere nearby?
Read on.
It's a technical description of a device: a barrel, cylinder, or lump of metal that's been heavily corroded.
"Actually... I should just go and teach Evrart a lesson in *concentration*."
No point. The bite mark is too small.
"But you don't have a car, do you?"
An infant could watch that.
From the bottom of this cesspool, and into the very heart of the earth, I breathe life into this song.
"Yeah, that's right." He smiles. "What the hell did that girl wanna do then? How did that girl become my *zeal?*"
"It's all in what I'm saying."
Stop, right now! You're getting your hopes up, but these jacket guys have the nasty habit of faking illness in the guise of medical expertise.
Perhaps it was a sound strategy? Perhaps they thought the previous tenants would be *bogged down* from hell -- it's all hunky dory.
The Old Old Old Model Road Runner
"That doesn't surprise me." She looks at the large block letters on the board. "It's just the way our world works."
The woman looks at the little sticker and sighs.
There may be some thrill of your own moving forward. Try something, then... maybe it's dangerous?
"Yeah, that's pretty much me."
"I'm a man in his 50s. I can do anything, officer. I'm a real man. You see."
"Of course I can give you the books, but I need to know your name first."
A *poor* house, with shabby furnishings and an inadequate kitchen... But the owner obviously knew how dangerous this situation really was.
I have to hear about this. You've run out of choices.
Don't be an idiot and say it. In fact, tell her you know what it stands for -- but keep your pants on. You'll hear about it later.
The name of the game is to find the phasmid, but not in this world. This is one of those rare cases where humanity has failed him.
We have made all manner of claims about this location... from the day the building stood here one had to be present for all of recorded history to have any kind of claim.
This is because you're the most over-radiated thing you've ever seen.
No. You can't. The thing is, it's not like that at all. There is no *accident*. The crash of a cannon ball slamming into the reeds on the other side of the mill is going to *always* be the correct one.
"Wait, you've already told us everything we need to know."
There's nothing to find. Just a room with some old curtains and the smell of linens on the shelves..."
"There's no questioning it. You look like you're about to break out the big guns. But then again -- you were out in the middle of the night and really *desperate* to get off. So much so that you ended up borrowing a weapon of some sort."
It will. This is a good place for a nice *weird* week. Think of all the *exciting* things to do!
If you were to go to the city and back again, this would probably be the place to go...
It's still rather bizarre -- how you managed to get yourself shot in the middle of all this.
He's right. Like ripping off that raincoat. You feel like it should be there... underneath...
Oh yeah. I'm serious.
He really doesn't want to do this.
Look, I know it's hard to get a hang of these things, but just so we're on the same page: you are a police officer.
For a fraction of a second, your vision is obscured by some kind of fog. You don't know why you had to point it out, because the plane itself is still there. Still *very* low, like you have no memory of it...
She squints, looking into your eyes. "I... want to say that, but I'm afraid I can't do it justice in one day."
You've spoken. The wall will now silently repeats the message -- for a decade or so, until the sea air degrades the enamel.
You pocket the note. A quick glance inside reveals that it was about Garte and his petty squabbles.
The desk at the other end of the room has been cleaned out. On it you see a collection of worn out binders, much like the one in your hand.
...as you turn to give her a salute. No sound comes over the speaker, just static.
You've strayed far from home, into the clutches of an angry and distrustful old man with a grudge against *you*.
"You don't fucking *do* those sorts of things. Go kill some hornet. Go straight for the jugular!"
"But you didn't listen to him."
C'mon. Have you tasted *any* drugs? You *know* you've had them. Smells like more of them. But you don't remember which ones...
Just saying words. You've done this before. Their absence from your mind does not mean anything. You have sustained an acoustic message to your moorings. Count them -- one at a time.
This is an optical spatial impossibility. If the missing person really was spotted then there would be a *square* hole in the city. If he wasn't spotted then there would be holes in the wall and in the church...
"The theft is still a *matter*, though. I need to take you in. You're bleeding, in the great water lock."
"I don't care if I can't remember shit. I don't care about art. I just want to keep the lights on."
A grand expanse of water reaches over the bay and to the horizon's calm horizon -- in the form of a map...
Two men and one woman stand in a small conference room in the abandoned coliseum. The man gives a list of demands, all of which seem to be quite lofty: *complete* the *landing* case; *enshrined* the *sounds*; and *Imprisoned* the *hanged man*.
An empty trap. Not a soul remains inside.
Your voice echoes on the water, but the vision of the gremlin boy is still too vivid for you to concentrate on it.
You really shouldn't.
"Yeah -- in the toilet. Over."
"These cocks will tear the fabric out from under your feet. When they rip it open you will be standing on the plank looking at the dead body a long time." He grabs the decorative loop on the loop, seems to be in awe of it. "Can I take you back there, Officer Disco?"
"Interesting... I'm not feeling it."
It's hard to say if this player is truly homeless. His or her story appears to be a side-tale, woven from unrelated facts and rumors. The player is free to ignore or dismiss it as such.
"Right, you might have noticed that there's a big gap between these two tiny things."
"It's all you care about, the skin." He bites his lip, then finally snaps his neck. "Why'd you hide the body in the trash?"
The lake of vomit is no place for a grown man to stay. You should get medical attention immediately.
In a state of seemingly numbness, she nods: "Nothing, just let me come in and out, like you."
The lieutenant nods, taking the bribe from your  -- what? Don't even think about it -- but mostly because he doesn't know how to say *no* without pushing the woman.
She looks like a young actress coming on the cover of a children's magazine. You have to *plummet* into this situation. You've never had to deal with a stalled case like this before.
And for what?
She sways her head, looking up at you from the window.
"Right when you get the sense one day that something's about to happen -- you're already in the doldrums."
With your back against the cold mosaic floor you feel the wind moving through the reeds...
So *isolated* you can feel the heat from the two remaining headlights of the motor carriage.
"A shitty little village... Then we don't look like sissies. We show up every day."
The doors seem to be shut before you. Make your way around them.
You crack open the old textbook. This
*Or* it could be that the curse was cast long ago, that these people are keeping the curse alive by burning witches' houses down...
"So... hi, officer."
You've seen demented people before, drank too much to remember. Guess what else is out there?
"Well, it's pretty shitty
Wait, is he sure it's not just an expression? He looks like an *extremely* disturbed teen. What *is* more?
No, it's more than that.
"I don't want to be the sheriff here, but I don't like doing these *sad detective work*. It's boring, B."
"In any case, I'm glad you're okay." She gets back to work.
"One more thing about the sandwich."
I don't know... something's missing here... maybe you were supposed to meet her at the Whirling-in-Rags but you missed it. But then you remember...
After a while he says, "I guess you could show some *enormous* leadership qualities by trying to convince him to step down."
"I'm not sure what's going on here,
Your parabellum needlessly escalated the matter. You should have someone *forcefully* remove the cuffs from her.
Inside, in a cell, the corridors of the DÜSQUAKE district are empty. Only the shift ladder remains standing, blinking in the wind.
"I'm sure I can come up with
A foul odour of rotting food comes over you as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window. The woman keeps smiling her distant smile, sundered by the shattered glass.
"Huh, what?" She looks at you with surprise, her green eyes shining. "How *did* you find this place?"
You listen to the steady beat of his drum on the sand, but no sound comes from there... You should have someone more present here.
"What are those strange words you used?"
The man stares at the emaciated corpse in the orange shirt, still wrapped in agony around the sporting event.
The tattooed mesque sinks deep into his skin. The wounds from the gun fight he suffered are reopened, but the liver moves only a few millilitres.
"No need for a list, Mr. Kitsuragi
"Let's discuss the beer."
You see gleaming white ceramic shine underneath -- a body heat, breathable underneath a shroud of drab neoprene.
"That's a reasonable sum. It's why the Hjelmdallers have held on to this shithole so long. Now it's all gone." He lets go of his tie, takes off his glasses and puts them back on.
There is *no* doubt in your mind that you're right, the fucker is accusing you of racism for not rallying behind Cuno.
"They're the ones you can't get in a normal police station -- the chain of command is weak, the local gangs have used the RCM to dispatch both short- and long-distance shakedowns to and from Jamrock, while the Union has traditionally manned the dock facilities."
He's insecure about being superior.
It's empty vessel turned upside down. The corpse below appears to be fully functional, if a bit limp.
See, all those incongruities and *exceptionalism* had nothing to do with this! You were just speculating. But now you have *the big one* -- the one they were talking about, so there's that...
"You're one lucky man, officer. You don't even have to go to the island."
He smiles. "And the party's over, man. We could have turned this into a disco ball for all the kids, but..." He looks to the town and suddenly fainting comes over him.
"That it does, detective. Very well, have the detective talk to Evrart about it. You have nothing to gain?"
"Hmm..." She doesn't really seem to know what to say.
The Man from Hjelmdall stares at you with contempt. "The *man from Hjelmdall* was just a man. In a *fantastere* art community. It doesn't mean anything. In a *fantastere* art community..."
"I don't know..." The old woman straightens her back. "Why not? I'm not a gardener. I don't know anything about drugs."
"A miracle. Just a miracle. A fucking miracle."
Somewhere in Central Jamrock lieutenant Kitsuragi stops your palm from running errands for you -- an acrimonious divorce on the rocks. He is a little irritated by your missing gun, he thinks.
The lieutenant looks at you wearily. "Please don't go ahead and accuse her. It would be unfair to *him*..."
It's just one small piece of paper. But you *know* it's there. You should have it. If you can't tell, you don't have it...
Who'd have thought? Maybe you were overprotective? Anyway, answer the man.
I'm not sure I *ride*...
The plastic cape is pulled tight over your head, ice and wind slicing and dicing around you.
Whatever it is, you can feel it -- this man's *morbid* exuberance. This is more than just a game -- it's a *cosmic opera*.
You want your past to tell you your present?
"These crates aren't going to bring the death here."
Of course it's not *unnatural*. It's not human. It's not *legendary*. This kind of magic doesn't happen often.
It's not good. Maybe you should stop doing this? Start over.
No need to linger. There's something to examine.
Cunn would have it! You're a weird fellow, who's not that often asked questions.
She's more likely to open up if it's been this bad
Also, it comes with an automatic compartment in its backpack. Inside, it's a treasure chest overflowing with rare coins and rare rarities!
Sounds like someone has melted half the plastic off with a lighter -- the pipe must have been recently plugged.
Your hand cramps up just holding the sandwich up -- and then a series of clicks, like the teeth of a cat chewing on a hard candy wrapper. The harsh light scatters. The sandwich is still alive, just slightly parted, crackling, at the end of its first bite.

The floor plan has been drawn out in red: A rectangular room, with one of the tables empty. Dirty lin
The toy then springs to life, spitting
What the fuck are you talking about? It was the snow. It was the first thing I remember hearing...
No one. You and I, but you and the seagull are the only seagulls in the history of recorded human beings.
The lieutenant has put down his notebook -- his hand is resting on his holster. He gives you an imperceptible nod.
He's been holed up in here for a while with no one to talk to. Seems like it was an accident waiting for someone to break loose.
"You think she can... answer some of these questions?"
"Yeah, it's Cuno. Cuno and his pig squad." He scoffs. "Back when you weren't really talking to me..."
Be careful -- when he talks about the bonfire, he's not talking about the great cataclysm that consumed his homeland...
"Your badge. I've kept it. Where
"A*wwink!" The tall blond man's face lights up with glee. "A real treat was that, officer. Really scintillating stuff!"
Now you're standing in front of the woman who brought you, laughing at how bad you got it. This is a small taste -- but don't let it scare you, man with a camera. You have *fun* left in you...
*Enough*. Cuno's listening.
You know, maybe you should change it *now*?! After you've thought this through and realized...
Is the bear about to come back to life?
It's perfect -- big, with a powerful cooling system. Now if you could just get the lieutenant to help you with the body...
That's clever! Harvesting his vulnerabilities is part of her game.
This is some sick shit. You would think he'd get the hang of it by now, but it seems he still doesn't.
"That's not necessarily a bad thing."
"There's a small memorial on the church wall. It reads very simply: 'My lost gun.' I don't know how you ever found it, officer. Maybe at my age I don't know how."
Perhaps the most *inspiring* is probably his 'Super Mario Bros'. title. It conjures up images of chequered fields, barrel-chested field marshalls, and hand-drawn boxes: smearing paper particulates, paper glued to cardboard, long dried roses in their monochrome, their veins streaming.
The war of independence has waged across the Ulander isola for the past 64 years, since the satellite nations withdrew in '41. Most of the  remaining  sovereignty-minded  people of the insular world live on the isola's central tip, on Semenia.
You *are* failing, buddy. There is no hope.
"Okay, okay..." He sounds somewhat defeated. "You can have this phone -- no problem. It's *my* radio."
"No, you did." He stares you down. "What's with all the *neckties*? You look like you're having trouble remembering what you're wearing, Harry."
You've just got to smile and bear it. Even a giant statue can't take you.
I have no idea.
The attendant explains that the booze they're storing it in is the kind of booze that *breaks records* -- it's *par excellence*.
"Some youth centre teacher -- mostly looking for new students. Her shop is right by the water lock. "
Goddamnit, she's getting so fucking everything
"With all the reasons I've been able to come up with..." He stops to think. "I don't want to do it any more."
While he stands on the patch, he looks directly into the wayward eye of lieutenant Kitsuragi.
In fact, you probably *could* take a sip right now if you turn the radio back on. Go ahead, try something!
His irritation is palpable, if not outright mocking.
Just so we're on the same page: Viktor is not a bad person. He's just *unnatural* to be in a position of authority over such a young woman.
Looks like they tried to justify it by saying they didn't have the *magic bullet* -- bullets don't work. Have you tried turning it on?
The huge satin rectangle doesn't look fragile at all. If anything, it looks *jagged*. It's ripped, gaunt even.
A random man somewhere chuckles with his hair on. He seems to be unperturbed by this whole discussion.
You see a navigational map and a schematic of the elevated motorway called *La Delta*, on the was formed by the Sum of All Fours.
"I didn't hear anything."
"Uh, I don't wanna..." He stares at you, dumbfounded. "What is this? Why am I asking you about stuff like this?"
Yeah, it's a shame. But the fact is -- you have to keep moving in order to properly analyze the jigsaw pieces.
"Damn, I wasn't expecting this. This guy's life is about a revolution and everything's going fine. But you, dearie, your... insides and everything else -- it's all just so broken. It's... un*cooperative. I can't... let it... break."
She doesn't know about those things.
Okay, yes. Yes, it's definitely some alcohol -- and some other things as well. But you can't remember what it was, can you?
Yup. Those are the two words you came up with. Sounds like magic -- except Mundi isn't white.
The ex-acto does *not* have to be a factor! Even when dealing with highly motivated individuals, his/her *notices* are not to be taken lightly.
"I'm not sure I understand. But we do have one... culprit with us." He nods toward the phasmid. "He sent you to stir the pot, the Union agent. He said you got in, *intimidated* him. You're a bad ass, officer, Johnny Law."
Get a hold of yourself, this isn't the Drunks and the Lovers and the Chicken Litterbox!
Fuck the fam. She doesn't *really* believe it's a good idea to paint a mural on the fence.
A lame duck?
"Do you know what I did?"
He's too weak to say *no* now. Waking up is the worst part. Maybe somewhere down the line you could decline...
Well, if it's a good idea, you should consider it. There's always a chance...
Somewhere in *Darienne* -- by the water's edge -- two police officers, one a motor carriage, a motor carriage and a RCM motor carriage drive through the traffic jam. The manual gearbox shifts into neutral with the carriages having stopped in their tracks.
"You think you're funny, but then you show up like a zombie, Nick. You don't look funny."
He doesn't want your frail mind caught up in something here. Something *unconnected* to the case.
"Okay. Let's go." (Accept the task at hand.)
He doesn't really think it's all that uncommon for people to live in caves.
Just as you start to pull apart the curtains one by one, a knock comes from the door. It's the resident who's *in* here.
It's clear she enjoys telling the story of her pétanque exploits -- though she is not actually looking towards the audience.
This is a procedure. The aim of the check is to see if it's possible.
"It's something *very* strange..."
He smiles, and looks at you with a strange look. "But you don't have to tell anyone you worked for the Fugitives, you know."
(Put the tape recorder down.)
Your punctuation has been absolutely obliterated. The only thing left to do is to come
I know you're confused, but hear me out... What if the government is really watching us *now*? Have you thought about that?
"I already told you I don't want any part of that pig, you were just being too trusting with this key. He's likely..." He repeats: "he could have been shot *before* you let him go."
"You know what, officer? You should've taken me off before you turned into... whatever it was."
"Jealousy. She's aggrieved because the Union boss's sister was in the film-theater. It was her fault."
The man stands there like a puppet
The couple watch as you crack open the bottle and begin to sip. All are absorbed in the sweet narcotic mixture.
*This* moment feels so *missing* when all the others left you to do. Don't ask where they went. It's not here.
"So, the war is *over*?"
Rock and roll has lost its meaning.
"No," the lieutenant steps in. "There are *some* smart cops out there -- he might be one of them."
As you've already decided, I would imagine. So what can I do about it?
With a violent gust of air the Man from Hjelmdall seizes the rapier in his hand and pulls the trigger...
The tattooed mesque sinks into his seat, lost amid the surrounding smoke and cold. A cold sweat moves across his chest...
He thinks it's stupid. Then he frowns, turns back to you. "Perhaps we should talk about the goddamn book, then."
YOU COULD HAVE USED THOSE PADMOUTS!
It's the pen of a *fellow traveller* -- a red folder, folder A in the bottom right corner of the console.
Well, you didn't *only* lose your gun -- you also drank yourself blind!
You feel as though you might as well be talking to a bird.
This happened in the middle of a hypostasis mark, which means he was under a lot of stress lately.
"Okay, cop, you're a detective, I can understand that, but I need kerosine here too. What do I do?"
His eyes narrow. His right hand starts tapping a quick little rhythm on his thigh: tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap *tap*...
Oh no, you're going to be gassed. Just shut up and say
The motion is instinctive. Like an electrical impulse. Before he can finish his movement, it's already too late...
She's right. The faucet doesn't turn the water lock.
He gives you a conspiratorial look. "I haven't the slightest doubt about that... cop's identity."
Before you stands a motor carriage. Its flat roofed roof terrifies you.
Don't be an idiot and say it. In this case, the situation is unlikely to change. The twins are pure, aimless, dangerous -- don't let them get you down.
Since you asked her about the Union, she hasn't had time to talk about the Things that are unimportant and boring.
"This is *about* my missing gun, right?"
Your grandfather inhaled the CO2, his lungs filled with it. When he exhaled, the ring was gone.
A spark of rage enters his eyes, accompanied by a snarl that suggests some kind of mountaineering challenge is in order.
"It's dangerous, officer, but we can't afford to lose this one. The matter is dealt with and we move on."
She thinks you're too emotional for your level of discourse. That's it. Sorry.
What's the most recent entry? (Conclude with journal.)
Somewhere in Jamrock North, a small fire pits burn. Flame retardant burns on a radiator. Dust rises from a worn fan. All the air islets are gone. In their place -- a single inhabitant stands in front of a smashed window. A long time ago.
The lieutenant nods in agreement.
It is said that those who have it in them to make the most of it will not be blessed with it. This is only something to keep in mind as you go along.
"He's obviously a legend among some of the men who work for the Union."
"Nothing. None of my business."
The *perfect* time for that would be at the club. Maybe you should just *party*? This isn't the end of the world, it's a lovely distraction.
Really stupid.
"I'm all ears. Can you help me get in the room?"
The garbage container. The gaunt figure in the middle of the yard, slowly emerging from the cadaver
The man before you sees death approaching, a sudden retreat from his clutches -- and maybe a bit of bleeding. Maybe the former convicts?
His thoughts are all on what to do now. This man is a great revolutionary if he were to get distracted.
The grass is always greener, the seas ever more indistinct...
She's scared now. She's done with you. Until she sees you again, in the hospital, she won't believe what she's seeing.
"I can see that."
You're already a bit distracted by the
"I'm not gonna do it, Kim."
Inspect the water lock.
The god damn mattress is feeling rather... comfortable. Don't get distracted.
This makes sense, except he's lying.
I feel the need to remind myself of my name
A cluster of gleaming white tents facing a sloping roof, shaped like a crenel, in the shadow of a three story tenement. Right next to it -- a sex slave camp...
"Yes. But the story is not over yet."
Old South. In backyards and on stoops and in church basements, smoke stacks rise over heads and shoulders. Beyond that, the air islet's western horizon becomes darker...
The damage done is so subtle, but it is there.
"Aye, so here you are, it's late and it's dark." She touches her cashmere sweater. "You should go and take a bath, like everyone else."
I guess the rest of you people can feel some loss too. The pain was more than you could take.
The Major-Of-The-Pit has been paid in full since the last war, and this is a good payment. His wallet is open.
"I tried not to stare at the corpse, but I *could* have. The reaction was instinctive, my young blood. I couldn't remember being this *awe* anymore..."
If the lieutenant thinks it's necessary to intervene, so be it. The lieutenant's *animation* is more important than yours -- at least the sound of his boots against the pavement.
That settles it
Oh, it's gonna be Cunoesse! Chaotic as they go, these gentlemen can make it worse. Just ask the others -- they'll tell you what it is, okay?
I don't care -- I'm *not* into that.
Look at the levers.
He turns back to you: "If you must. I have little to no reason to *not* let you keep your guns. You're under arrest if you don't."
This is a lie. There's no way of telling *you're* lying. Maybe it's the hangover or the memory loss?
Rubbish! You're too weak to say that now. I'll have you know that even a police officer has a *family* to support. Not a *spouse*.
He shrugs. "Fuck, man, can't say. At least not yet. Learn as you go. Show up to work, after sixteen years behind the scenes, you're still smoking..."
And then suddenly you see it: a *little* bit of wind, blowing across the mountainside. The canals that formed the quays and the bridges that connect them -- all the way down into the harbor. Bayside in the wind, just one
That's not a problem for him. He already knows the colours.
You *need* to answer this question, detective.
In addition to the worker and building tokens used by each player, there are also several piles of colorful resource tokens, each representing one of the game's four principal resources...
But she *is* a waitress.
But you still can't connect the dots! There's no way that's what he meant -- it's not just a question of *facts*.
I should buy those cigarettes.
You fumble with the latches on the belt -- you seem to be missing something here. This woman's *special* knife, if you know what it is -- may help you return to the previous page.
"Right fucking here, it's right here!" He gives you a happy
"And then went to work for them.
It could be argued that the  LUMINOUS DOME was already here, albeit temporarily -- the dome was cast to reflect the daytime heat.
SIGH AND WAIT.
The lieutenant nods toward the door, then turns to the side, disappearing behind the curtains.
This place is full of smoke and mirrors! Imagine the hard core being reflected back in white. A little closley?
"*So* I did -- I led the way." He nods solemnly. "I am indebted to you, Harry. Thank you for looking into this matter and bringing this to my attention."
On the banner hanging above the entrance: "Republic of Samara", a peninsula in the Cordillera Sinope. The words "Samara" are crossed charging over a crest. The *Canterre region* is its southernmost part
There is a movement next to the truck, behind the crane's swaying beam. It's getting cold, a faint smell of burning rubber against his hands.
Oh my. There's no hurry. He's right. You should get moving.
Read
What was the head-measurement?
"How long have you been there?"
Oh no! Please. Maybe you *are* an animal, or something else entirely. You might be allergic to bee stings, for example.
It's *is* the single greatest thing you can do to advance your career.
"Sure, Cuno, so be it, I have some questions about the union."
The maps you found are scattered across the map board. It's a neat set -- urban planning, football, and adrenaline junkies in general. You *may* know the name of the artist, but you don't know the full name.
Even with the threat of physical harm looming large, the papers remain perfectly still. You have no choice but to buy the coffee, even if it isn't the right mugger...
"Won't make us into hostages. We're strong."
Fine. Don't look now, but at your hands you could do a disservice to your hands and your fingers could start to peel off the gloves you're currently using. What if you just shake them?
"Except the ones who take everything."
(Look at the gears.) "Um... one of them? I could have sworn that there's one in the teeth of the wall."
You were too noisy last night... It wasn't your fault. If you really *want* to sleep... Do it. Don't argue. Just go to sleep.
It seems that it was a matter of national reconciliation after all -- the two nations of the Adriatic are united in the spiritual reunion.
The abundance of bullet holes leads to two options: either an inordinate amount of murders took place here, or this was a massacre.
It was an honour to serve with you. Perhaps a little pressure was required for your sake? Perhaps *THE PRYBAR*?
This is your fault. I tried to cheer her up, but she's too distraught to talk now. Maybe tomorrow?
For a moment you cease to read the note: *You're fired!* You look down at your hands, which continue to spread gravy even now -- gravy that's been seeping up your whole being since you woke up.
Flipping through the book you finds a few pages describing the *Purple Heart Youth* a charity golf tournament held in Revachol in July of '38.
Hear that? Now, let's move on.
But I'm just a man.
And then, for no apparent reason, your fist connects with the boot. You hear a *growl* from the fugitive.
The drive through has an S in the shape of a cross, a S in the shape of a pentagram, and -- in the middle -- the *S'' symbol.
Keep the drivel in. The black suit -- in its heyday a suitor had been wandering around town with strange gear... Strange gear, no doubt...
Your hyper-sensitivity has the truth all to itself. It's a small thing -- but he does *not* trust you.
"*Paperwork*... or paperwork? I didn't even sign the papers, it was Rivkin! He's my son! I *took* him!"
Lifted some weights.
"Can't go on like this." He turns to you: "You've got to lay
It *has*. And there is no coming back from it.
You don't know why you're like this. But believe me, they don't want to see you in your Sunday best.
"Look, it's just a piece of art. We need to buy a new eye for this show, okay? Money is
The lieutenant nods. "Good news is -- I've got a number, call in advance."
"I'm just a cop, I don't mean to be rude."
His dark eyes linger on your form... Until your not-underest in the eyes, hard core brooding mode is activated...
He waves your gun away without looking. "Fuck the system! Go away, try something else! Say something else first, OK?"
You should ask her about the body's location *before* getting drunk. Who knows what incriminating info you could obtain!
You hide it well, but behind the damaged window there is an *UNFINISHED* silhouette rising from the wing...
What a sad guy. Don't even try to do anything about it. You'll never succeed. All you can do is beg and hope for the best...
God dammit, don't be an idiot. The door *will* allow you to pass if it's smashed... and you will!
He picks up a level and inspects it against the moonlit night. The wire is taut, the metal springs loose like a spring loaded glove.
"Will you sign this document?
"This seems like a really good opportunity to make some money."
You were a sad drunk who bought an ugly tie -- who gives a shit! Everyone is going to die because our plan didn't work. You failed. And you did so in living memory
The mainstay, the A-10. Four-barrelled. It was commissioned in '41 and used in '42, '43 and '44, becoming the single most important line of deployment of all time. It also saw service in the Indochina Campaign.
"You have the biggest stick." (Point to yourself.)
"Is he not afraid?"
Open your eyes.
You can be an anti-war activist, a communist, an aesthete. There are many, many political positions.
Really? Like some kind of... surfer? The one on the cover is pretty much a *nano* anyway. You can't even tell the difference.
The lieutenant's right. The sandpaper would *not* adhere to your *body*. And *the world* is full of *plenty* -- it even has oxygen.
"Alright. And what's the *Reál* do?"
"I don't know..." she looks around. "Do I have any *hostility* in me toward the bourgeoisie?"
"Like I said -- this was my own contribution to the war effort." He looks around. "
He's struggling to perform an autopsy on his brother's corpse. The hole opens up in his stomach. He doesn't know what to do. It's a miracle he doesn't pass out from the effects of alcohol and god knows what else...
As if it weren't obvious from the garish tie, which you managed to rip off in the first place.
Don't let him finish the thought. Listen within the place of industry, where his talent truly is...
You're right, you're not a *really* bad singer, either. Even Goldie couldn't sing something like this.
"No." She takes a step back. "Sorry. The idea of it didn't come up. You don't *really* talk to him often."
If anything, you're glad you listened to him and not screamed at him. You should sing this, see what he thinks: it's important.
Your socks are not *uniform* -- they are highly organic (visceral) smelling. You have an 'o' ring to it.
What?! Speed? Oh god... Are you sure you want to go *now* with this? Remember, you've earned it.
Of course, not every mark is representative of the denizens of Holdfast. Some are just orphans...
No. It's just curious curiosity.
This won't do. The image is too heavy.
That's the least of your concern right now. The most pressing thing is: where did this *crazy* man go?
He considers this for a moment. "That's right. You've been to the fucking island, Harry. And seen all the drugs and the weird shit there. Fucking incredible."
He takes the free handkerchief from the knot, brushes it off, then mumbles: "Shoot him in the fucking head..."
"Mhm. That explains all the stuff *I* didn't tell you."
Feld Electric Trigatorn or just FETORRODYNAMIC *-- the company is short *and* boring. Do you really want to call him that?
A terrible cold comes over you as you look at the tree. There's no wind, just the sound of snow on the branches.
"But I really want to know what's behind this massive Hjel
Okay. True, *your* missing bicycle helmet facts nothing.
"I know you don't like her, but I'm not the only one..."
"Thank you, but I don't want to talk about it any more."
Oh... and your eyesight is *good*...
Oh my god, you're doomed. You *can't* run from it. It's biting down on your thoughts.
A shoe cupboard just off to the right? This is far from over -- just another day, just like the last time.
He coughs, then looks down at you, his voice carried on the wind: "We should have seen it, officer... But we were so used to him having a cigarette, it took a while for that to go out of him..."
You look around. The wind blows. It's cold outside, and the little stalls on the pavement are dying.
Your words echo in the empty chamber, echoing against the wet floor tiles. The moth remains silent, staring at your feet.
It just *is* the beginning. Far away and outside, in the Great City of Revachol -- your mind attempts to conjure up other and other images, all of them equally *unreal*. But all of them are so far away...
With a violent jerk of his finger, the man draws a horrible slash through his chest. The heart of a hunter. Then a scream...
The gurgling sounds continue as he attempts to swallow his food. He looks at the empty canister.
The Sonoran Desert is one of the six major Mesque *areas*, along with the Isidro, Gran Mar, Insulinde and Katla. It is not a place. It is silence.
"My friend lives nearby. She doesn't usually do, but she's always willing to help out when she can."
"Wow. So much for caution."
Wait, what? You didn't say if it's your *copotype*. Flyboy's not the guy to ask about your copotype.
Your fist connects to his chest, cold and dry, as you smash into his heart. You're both still in that cold, wet apocalypse together now.
Read about Kim's wife.
OK, YOU'RE OUT OF LINE! WHEN DID YOUR CHILD THE CHILD THE CHILD? WHEN DID YOUR CHILD THE CHILD THINK DRUGS ARE SUCH A PART OF HUMAN RACISM?
Oh, *bratan*, how you coyo! I didn't even ask if you're *crazy*. Why's that? It's unimportant.
"I've been shot and had some blood all over me. But I'm good."
No. You *can't* stop. You can't take it. The brain tells you: you've worn that jacket and that tie look damn cool together. You should have worn it with that necklace, too. If you tried to hide the ligature, it would look too perfect.
AND AMONG THOSE WHO WERE IN THE HOOKAH PARLOUR NEXT TO YOU. THERE IS NOTHING MORE THAT YOU CAN SAY.
Wow. *Pier*? No, that's not how tall it is. The roof here is too low, the snowstorms are too deep. You could slip and fall. Don't worry. Keep your eyes on the prize case!
At the farthest reaches of the station, accessed via an airship overhead. Radial escalators separate Martinaise from Centre Precinct, and to the West the trigger's a bit funky looking...
"I wouldn't be so sure."
I was wrong. My spine is tough as rebar. It can take a beating though, and I've been martyred many times by my erstwhile rock n' roll addiction.
Doesn't sound like he would...
No, not shush! He could say he was taking the fall for someone. Or disoriented. Trying to remember what you said.
Are you going to *lie* about something as sacrosanct as truth? Don't make it sound like you're weak -- you're far stronger than this, *bratushka*.
The wood panel on the side windows has obviously been sanded to a fine shine. It will also keep you warm here in the winter.
A kojkos pelagic? There's no way a cop could live like that.
"Titties. Another round."
"Haven't *we* seen anyone like that before? Oh, we have, yes we have. The town crier is under-the-inferno now, and I'm helping him drag it all the way around here..." He looks at you with soft melancholy.
Meaning: These people are suffering because of *society's* indifference. You should be using your magic wand, superman, to *fix* their world.
Thank you, Dark Arts advocate.
There has to be. Two hundred people standing on a single filing cabinet, taking your paperwork! You're not big enough to do this alone.
It'll end with one of you being a police officer -- *not* the case against you being a cop. On one hand you just can't help but notice how familiar that sounds.
A lie. I forbid you to say it.
The man looks across the water: at the city, a collection of old wooden houses on the river Seine, their chimneys huge and far away. Then at you:
"Oh, I guess I know about those." The lieutenant draws up a little notebook. "Here's what I'd come up with."
The man's got the bigger gun, but he's *always* around. If anything, you'd think he'd be more *sensitive* -- but you'd never know because there's no way to read a person's mind.
"I guess I don't really know how to answer that."
"Oh, you're a... *fellow* officer, are you not? It's my pleasure to present my recommendations for you. *And*..."
If it's not too late...
SAY IT AGAIN -- THAT IS NOT ME. I AM A SELF-INDULGED EXHAUST. NOW -- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"
Damn, what *are* you talking about? You have no idea what you're talking about. Be careful.
Right. This would explain its antenna being up there. On top of it.
"Hey, if you're so concerned about your rights then at least leave me some change!" He looks you dead in the eye.
She puts the brush aside.
The lieutenant is encouraging you to crack this case, in case you somehow have any doubts about the primacy of reason in this world.
She's referring to alcohol use, not... actual substance use.
Tell me about another alien...
"Nah, nah, I'm not that person any more. Not good enough anymore."
You, your... your... brain... need to be more objective in this quest.
Smooth as ice
"I want to bring back the glory days."
Perseverance and success... feels so satisfying. Feels like a finality, like the end of a journey.
No one does.
No,
He is inevitably distracted by your seemingly *hard-core* style.
Yeah, well, she was heavy and she was heavy, but that's no excuse for that stupid gun.
Stop. Just take the pièce de résistance and add it to the pot. You *will*.
Once
You're in. This is a learning experience, don't try to do it again.
Your fist connects to the boot with the same *ding*. The sound does not seem to get louder, but you're still physically unable to lift it.
The sigh is tender, yes, but tempered by something else, a thought she can't express... Interesting.
"Fine." The lieutenant nods. "So what do you want to know?"
You're under the effects of a Mind Flayer.
"I was not planning on doing that."
You're beginning to suspect that something's missing. Something like the gun you
You now have the psychological and the physical power to overpower him. This man has lost his will to fight.
"So, what was it?"
"...would have been *horrible*."
"Yeah, I knew it. I'm getting old. Sad age is almost never a good sign for bad interpersonal relations."
Yup. Felt like a snowball's gonna roll in. Wanna hear about some ball game? Maybe some soccer? Never mind -- feel the *spring* rolling in now.
A shabby door stands before you, an irregular mass of wood and leather. The lock looks like it may have been modified recently.
"Possibly, yes. An old man with a bad shoulder. But he was a good leader."
"Gah, that's not going to help!"
"Hmm. It seems you're not the only one. Let's see..."
There was no point in developing the tension, he thinks. The check has been made too high. We made it too easy. We were afraid you'd take it.
And lots of shit. It's fine. Stop thinking about it any more.
A wrinkled old man sits on a logging platform, fishing around in the mud. As you approach, he gives you a sideways glance.
"No, that's impossible. I can't *evaporate*." She pulls her t-shirt up to her chest. The chill is excruciating.
The glass is dusty from years of sitting. You can see traces of glue and other flake-like substance on the sides of the glass.
You're smart. You know how this works.
Squint your eyes and look away, as though you weren't sure enough of yourself to complete the dance anyway.
With an ugly tremor, but no pain... you could say you felt it -- a particularly nasty smell as it moved through your clothes.
There's no mistaking the feeling of coming face to face with the monster that lurks in the dark corners of your mind.
An adventurer walking in the rain, or a blockade runner... No, no, no. He would *never* do something like this.
"...because they're all liars."
The young woman looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you. She does not seem convinced that this will work out.
We must have met at some point. You listening in on *that call*? That *lt?* Perhaps it's something you *can* help with...
She doesn't mean to be antagonistic, but it just felt like you needed to say something.
"Yes, well..." He stares at you with his weird eyes. "He may have been able to offer *some* assistance, however..."
"Okay, we're looking for a missing entomologist."
In your hand you hold four-sided dice. On each side you see...
Something about it makes you want to run for the hills
As you open your eyes, you should scream...
The truck driver's* cab is still warm from the engine's charcoal splashes.
"And that's only the tip of the iceberg -- what are we looking at here?"
A flare of pain goes through him and he yelps. Then he catches it, the image gone and the meat simmering.
You're right. There's a good explanation for all this.
As the days go by and the weeks worsen, Cuno begins to look around less and less hopeful, less and less hopeful...
"I did? I... I didn't know... really."
She's been holed up in here for a while with no one to talk to. Maybe it's because she's so tense she can't even remember your name?
Give them a lift, Shaquille O'Neal. You know where they'll go... into *unpredictable*, *eventually* they will strike.
Suddenly you feel like a *laughing hand* -- the gremlin hand with the empty eye of an insect! Feels like fun! Feels like *exceedingly* high-- but you can't tell because of the stench!
A look of disgust passes her face. "You're getting off easy," she says to you, as you stand there in this shitty mood.
While the big boys are blowing shit in the air, you're heating the ground with your own cigarette butt. The circulation in your hands gets heavier...
In the middle of a broken plaza, in a cone of light barely visible in the daytime, two men, one slim, the other sturdy. They are on the city stage, but only one of them knows his lines...
What are you talking about -- jamais vu thought complete? You need to finish this thought, or you'll fail.
The latches on the frame seem hygenic, like the DNA on a single strand of RNA.
He sighs. "Theo was old. A while ago. I think. Whatever he told you, he's lied to you. He's kept you from the right memory with the wrong instructions. At least, that's the way it was with the old man.
This is a great base for aiming down the sights. It would have taken a lot of work to make it work properly.
Like a small child, your words find its way to the *innocence* of the speaker.
A silvery coat hangs on the wall, served up from the tap, probably late one night. The room is almost empty; a flashlight is still on.
The stupid expression is sincere.
It's a *beginning* with the sound of shattering glass echoing through the bay.
I'm all ears. (Pull down your coasters.)
You had a long time to think about it and now it feels like you squint your eyes and repeat: "That's Ricky G."
"There are millions of possible choices, Harry. In a million years I have never even considered what *you* would want me to say." His voice echoes in the cold air of the church.
He smacks his lips. "I won't, though, because it's not my place to be a policeman. And I won't because it's not my day off."
How do I open this?
Oh, but you *will*. You've been trying to catch it all these years. But it will *always* be with you, the finality of the run-away mother of all spin-offs, your reminder that you *must* nail it -- no, just *ask* now.
The sphere is an organic compound composed of oxygen, hydrogen, and oxygen monohydrate. It has been found in many locations around the world, mostly in the volcanic cones of the Andes.
The terrified lieutenant appears disoriented. "It's a strange sensation... Like there's something alive inside me..."
And a bit of... who cares that you don't remember! Ask her about the cryptid, if you have the time.
Wearing out a *commune* is a criminal offence. Go to the Local Intelligencer and get a head's *off*!
It's not my body. It's not my spine. It's nothing of the sort.

LOOK AT THE COAT! You should have one too, it's important!
Your fingers find their way inside the vortex of anodized aluminum. Glowing blue-black symbols line the keyboard. Your skin is enchanted by their energy. With each key you press, the symbols disappear from your mind -- into your skin...
His friend grabs the receiver and weeps. "It's an Oranje Insulindian painted quadrotic bird. Often mistaken for a Garte or anhedonia
"Yes, I'm good," he says with pride.
Yes. From a distance. But you can't really move fast enough to avoid colliding with the building's top floors. You'll get up and go, but how long can you stay down there?
Read about the Day The Earth Stood Still and the similarities between Cunoesse and Klara.
Even now it's a little embarrassing for the cagey-looking backstay here. The one-piece chain doesn't really say *what* it does, does it?
Time to collect them!
What you're saying is: I have a job to do.
No. It's a project.
This is an *unusual* flavour of pain.
Wait, really?
Why, do you want to feel okay? You really feel like a *Lingua Franca*. And its myriad variant forms.
Oh yeah, sire. Like a cork being put right between your nostrils. What could possibly go wrong?
There is no way to turn this around. Kim will not be sold short.
"I know, you're the most racist cop I've ever met. But I still want to know."
Wait, I've got it: The possible locations of the missing *masques* have been carefully weighed and spread out over the 2 km2 exclusion zone. The detailed calculations were made to give an elevated position to the
"No one *ever* disappears like that. Even if you are the last one standing, that magic you -- that is always there."
Interesting. Your very own *Copopedia* comes with you. In the palm of your hand -- numbered one to thirty-something -- you add or subtract one from the retired tongue of Hjelmdall.
All in a wince. A thin, oily wince. Like you're on some kind of antipsychotic. Like you're on some kind of *olymphed,* some kind of hallucinogenic.
You've read enough. Let's move on.
The lady in the wheel-chair is right next to you -- if you just glance at her she would probably...
"No, not this again," he says, turning to you. "What was this about, Kim? I've got nothing to tell you."
The wind ruffles her hair as she looks to her right, away from you.
She is perturbed by your not knowing what year it is -- but not by your mention of the apocalypse. It *must* be the end times.
"Just one. I have to be away for six to nine months."
I'm scared. I'm going to think less of you after this.
And she's cold as ice. Death comes too, but she moves faster than you can say *thousandths*.
She's not even
With the express livery of a Coupris Kineema motor carriage, you drive into the night. Across the river a solid plank of cold water is formed on the dark borderlands...
Only the chief petty officer makes it back to the desk -- the rest are either in the brig or on the way.
The FALN 'Ultras' are a race of flying mammals which, during the 'Revacholian Phases,' flew over most of the world, until about A.D. 300. The FALN 'Ultras' are also known for their propensity for destroying property.
Is he indeed... jealous?
To be honest: you have no idea. You may have misheard it. Or maybe you just don't *want* to ask things.
He sighs. "Yeah, those who took the flak were lucky. It was shit, but they got their shit together."
"I see it. The giant ice bear. I'm glad I did not get a chance to ask him about it, you see."
"He's just not a very good actor."
Okay. The script is pretty much: Jacob, a twenty something, two years into a twenty something slump: how does he respond to verbal intimidation? *How* can he not? He's a lorry driver, remember?
No, it's the -ismatic musical guest. You feel the drop -- a spiritual one, kept in a sterile environment.
Wait! There's an instrument... The geomagnetic dipole is amplified, amplified the magnetic field around her. It warms her to the point where she thinks she's about to die.
"But it doesn't have to be like this. I think we can still have a little talk about the city and the people we're going to meet."
"I'm sorry I had to."
This worked?
It's not your fault. It's neither my fault, nor yours. You just have to accept the fact that you're a super-detective and move on.
There's a small twitch in his left ear
The pole has been carefully cut, and the wiring has been redone and attached to a standard indoor plug. The installation appears to be complete.
After a while, the lieutenant mulls the matter over. "Perhaps it's best to conclude with a warning -- don't let your imagination run wild after this."
It's the nickname of a former member of the Filippian royal family.
"Yeah, it's definitely the mouse."
In conclusion, early spring is a critical time for invading superpowers. The time of the cold, the isola...
You should probably buy a new shirt.
There's something in her light brown eyes... you should ask her about it, if you can find a way to connect to her in her state.
What if I don't want to have children?
"What *do* we need from these machines?"
Should I invite her out?
From the bottom of one of the islets we learn that there's an almost unlimited supply of cocaine, which *you* have, by exploiting the people who grow it. There's no such thing as a cocaine induced hangover.
You've already waited long enough!
He nods. "I don't really need to elaborate on this any further."
The man says something, but it's not clear what. A thump comes from the left side of the stomach.
Of course, it's only a *scheme*. There can be little schemes go. Little *discrepancies* can't hurt *anyone*.
Take the card.
Oh fuck! You don't have a role to play here... you shouldn't have gotten involved in this mess.
This is also one of the few places in Martinaise I have not been to... (Search for your lost gun.)
Look into the empty trap.
"Oh, thank you, sweetie. I'm *so* grateful. Thank you... so much. I really don't know where I would be without you..." she begins, but then puts her hands over her head and says it again: "Thank you, Harry."
The dicemaker frowns. "I don't even consider myself a *gravedigger*
The truck they're driving, the one they stole, the house they lived in -- it *was* large enough for both.
"If I am, this would probably be the most dramatic interaction of my life."
Ignore the box.
You feel the metal beneath your fingernails -- the tatters of flesh beneath your skin. It's cold.
"There's nothing to hold on to, that's all." She sounds so tired suddenly. "Just... god, please..."
The metal is cold from the wind, but not so shiny. This isn't your weapon of choice, but it would at least be functional. Better to just leave it unattended.
"Binoclard, top. Tin-soldier."
Look at the notebook.
Fine, keep it that way. The scar on Kim's face gives you away...
"Fucking right, pig." The old man, through clenched teeth, rips out the paper and hands you the photo.
He turns back to you. "But I mean, you seem to have more important things to worry about..."
"The wind is what brings everything to a crashing halt. The pale is what breaks the waves." (Point to the coast.)
"It's a good thing you're a cop, I'm sure. He doesn't need his little man-smokes-and-cigs anymore."
The dress you found fits her well, no doubt an acquired taste. It's a subtle difference -- but he's picking on you.
"Oh no..." She shakes her head slowly. "I've already done so much as *me* -- I'm a broken woman."
"Don't worry, Titus. This time you don't get to go home." Her expression
No, he's calm down now. He's sorry for yelling at you.
"Actually, I have to decline. I'm *not* a policeman."
It's perfect -- big, with a powerful cooling system. Now if you could just find a way to turn the radio back on...
"*Yes*, that's what I want you to say."
Be subtle. This man thinks you're armed and dangerous, but be subtle about it. You *know* he didn't.
It's no wonder you're running so late. You should talk to Kim about it, see what he has to say.
"Right. So what? It was obvious he was
*If you want the proof, just go down and look...* -- It's dangerous out there, Harry. Too *defensive* there.
"The woman I took his virginity from? She must be his mother."
It was a nice touch to have both hands on the corpse, analyzing it with your scientific hand.
It's empty without the inhabitants.*'He' -- that's what the guys up there called you.
"All the meats I've ever been through have come from my mother..." She adds dryly, "but that girl, I think she's the only one I've ever been to..."
This is the Locust City, a huge metropolis on the isola of Mundi. An artificial satellite of sorts, built into the heart of the world. It's an artificial city, a confection made to simulate the realities of the world.
It's a metaphor. He's saying *you're too emotional* or *you can't trust your own eyes*.
"You don't have to answer that." He doesn't look up from his notebook. "I was just being sarcastic."
They're gone. First they fly away, then they stay put, fooling around in the rain. You see clouds of rain fall on the sand, a curious layer of snow falling from the sky.
The woman looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you.
Leave it empty.
She's thinking how  sexy it is and just how pleased she is with you.
"But... could I see your passport? You seem to be a regular
These specifications are the lowest common denominator of sounds in the language, right behind the humdrum *sounds*. (You feel a twitch -- or maybe it's the sound of saliva on your mouth, together with a slight *ka-ta-ka*...)
"Okay, Kim, let's change the subject."
The coast is desolate. The wind is salty. You hear it rattling the windows of the truck. And then -- behind them, across the salt water...
Who... what... *bratan*?
"*Nothing*. What's there to do. It's all over."
The handle is loose from violent, sudden motions. The magnet sticks to the magnetized metal.
An old cigar. Cigars are not my taste.
"Not my style," the lieutenant marks.
"What?" There's panic in the man's voice.
You feel the high of the chain saw's metal. Your biceps and triceps ache. The cool fades away. You remember the sight of the tool leaving its wielder, along with all the weight -- with a firm punch, just barely raised the chain...
He meant it. There's a *reason* why she does these things -- and she hasn't told it to you yet. But the *hypothetical* doesn't hurt any less.
"I haven't -- you haven't?"
Behold the fear and confusion he's created in your mind!
"Fuck the system!"
No. A *tiny bit* there, underneath. The vibrations in your spinal fluid is what you're looking for. Apply
[$asteroid_seolite@bathtub_rainbow],
"Cuno's just hungry. Do the G.O.D.H.N."
I have no idea. I don't *want* to be the one in charge here, I don't wanna yell at the window or do anything *really* crazy.
The hustler's tongue is his half-open sign language for concealing the soullessness of the material world.
It seems that the calf has performed some kind of a miracle. It seems that the calf can talk -- at least, that's how it was supposed to do.
Of course! I was going to give you one. Just ask him if he needs anything.
Tell her about the magic
This woman just wanted to be left alone.
"Are you the reputed
The result is still being checked by the computer. There is *no* sign of cheating on the data here.
She's right -- the window must be open.
She smiled at you. She smiled. And she kept the grin in. Because she *liked* you. She must have known you were unclimbable.
It's a shadowy cylinder, cylinder, cylinder. Go ahead, do some cylinder. Whatever it is, it's probably not worth the candle you're using.
It's open, you can't keep it down. You'll blow your own brains out.
Maybe you could open the container? That's *what* talking, isn't it? To see if it's empty, then -- maybe you should keep an eye out?
You are not in charge of this investigation anymore, you are a common thread, a random note in the vast sea of neurological endings.
He sounds a bit like a *clown*. You think the sign language skills he's developed is tied together with his pranks...
Seems like an interet is best known for its tartan-themed radio stations.
It feels as if the nameless town is far away, on another continent entirely. There's a highway that runs through its center -- and the highway splits into smaller roads that connect the small towns down the coast.
While the woman's beauty has long since been stripped bare, glimpses of the divine are still seeping into her clothes, hair and makeup.
The holder of this power now stands before a weapon that's loosed a thousand-yard armada of bullets. The powder burns in your hands.
On the day you got the body, it was already following you in the spirit world. This was before you even touched it. You never will.
She's silent for a second. Looks like a small drop of rain has settled on the wooden panel with the number 4 written on it.
"Ah, well. If you're so worried about your health, then I'm not sure what's *wrong* with you." She looks around. "Maybe you should talk to your gimp about it. One time. In private!"
"I want to buy the Whirling."
"How?" The lieutenant looks at you with astonishment.
"Thank you, ma'am."
You should sing the sad small church tune, as a nice surprise. Thought it was obvious...
She's silent for a second.
Wow, this biography sounds super boring. You know what you should do? Get rid of the plants and start all over again.
Somewhere in a hidden court, fiddling with arcane crystals, a strange wearing of noble virgins seems ever more sure. A glass-polished glove, a sacred amulet -- these are the
"I got shot in the shoulder, but luckily I was standing right here with my pants off, so that's good. No problem now, I got this shit to myself."
This is an inverted pyramid. The floor is made of red plastic and mirrors. Three men stand on each of the upper floors of a four story apartment building. The roof is made of metal.
Already know -- this is one of the few times in your life when you *aren't* destroying everything.
You close your eyes and dream of the shapes your body should form to bring it about. A strange yet exciting new world order suddenly grips your mind.
It is a contradiction in terms -- but it *is* important. Ask again.
"Okay. I know this sounds strange, but we really need to talk about it. I really need to talk about this cold case. The mob boss, his boy..." He pauses in amazement.
There is an arc de minimis in the air, a precarious point on the wall that appears to be raised -- something pokes the hole in the wall. But you can't make out the answer.
You could also climb inside his head and take some of the scorching rays there. See if it's possible to *hear* through his skull.
You should try to open the curtains.
You still have an extremely *pale* nose for this stuff. You should really check out the "ugly" parts, like the *nasty* parts.
"I think we should let this gang go, Titus." (Don't make it easier on them.) "They haven't done anything."
The boombox craze of the late sixties is long gone, but certain images from that decade still linger in the brains of many people.
"I think you have mis-remembered something... my name?"
The hole in the asphalt.
She is implying you're not the most authentic leadership type.
The lieutenant is a rational observer of reality. His worldview can't accommodate this kind of thing.
Sometimes an entire set of skeletal muscles has to be supported by the weight of the wearer, in order to get the jacket off.
The lieutenant looks at you, beady-eyed: "But you're under arrest for this -- reckless endangerment. If you don't drop it, we'll arrest you."
Relax. You're gonna need that red-dyed fuel, from somewhere... The redoubt is gonna be important.
"No, no," he snaps out of his daze. "I told you the h
"It's as if there's this huge, inconsequential dotty-dream band..."
"Yeah," he grins. "They are really bad to the core -- but then again, what's a man, anyway? Even with all the shit they *are*."
Doesn't sound like he's a narcissist -- maybe you weren't clear enough to open the file? (Decline.)
The sky is indifferent to your silent nod, but someone has been squatting here. In a way it's *never* a good sign.
I know there's *nothing* to see here, you lying sack of shit. But you don't have to lead this world. You can change the course of history and wake up on the other side.
It does look bad, doesn't it? The crude drawings of the geologists. And the half-built *cities* perched on top of one another, like bits of sediment rising out of water. Resinous. And yet...
A smug, *cool* cop who doesn't give a shit about his gun. Just a cop who's jealous of the other cops.
It's like the most seditious of *argument* you've ever heard. And yet you feel so *right*.
He's not comfortable talking about the cop matter at hand, the cop scandal that's besmirched his otherwise pristine image.
The frail woman has emptied her stomach. All she can do is force one hand to remain motionless, the other to join in.
The man is dead inside, but there's no breath coming from his coming at the scene of his death. It's implied.
"I don't think I feel much any more. In fact, I'm feeling really bad."
What's that about the stupid hat?
"He keeps himself together." He looks over his shoulder. "But the lieutenant would *totally* shoot him."
She keeps her shoulders squared and her back straight but it's clear you're still making her sad.
Look, the jacket itself is uncluttered -- you could use a pen, or a notebook, to write some notes. Anyway, it looks badass.
"Hey, man, why don't you sleep here? It's right here!" He grins. "Always the good one."
With a *belch* the young man collapses out of his arms, head first into the fetal position. It's impossible to get a good grip on him, the skull does not budge.
Punched the door twice harder.
You're starting to suspect there may be *some* hidden motive here. Perhaps she was trying to distract you?
"I'm not as black as your father."
So she doesn't *really* want to be a detective?
You didn't say it with the aim of stirring the pot, you fucking idiot. Nothing happens when you wink at her. It's an accident.
It's nothing. You're alive, you're sane, and you still have a way to go before you're ready to *integrate* into human society.
Sorry, you didn't hear it.
"Then the party was over. The disco was over, the kids ran out on the dancefloor."
I'm getting round to this, isn't this what you've wanted your whole life? Even after all these terrible choices?
"Forgetting your badge doesn't change a thing."
"The howl is deafening. I think I hear someone breathing now."
With a swift, jerking motion the old man grabs the ledge and tries to push it aside with all his weight.
The lead programmer turns to you as she breathes out. "Hello, it's an automated message. What happened to Rewind 2? Why aren't you listening to what Leon or I think you'll be doing?"
You could seize this moment and attack the rampaging monster. But you're not a jolly boozer... You're a police officer. This is what you get for trying to "party with" her.
You're *exactly* what? You're close enough now to *feel* the winged serpent with the empty bottle in your hand...
The door rattles against
The lieutenant's a professional, the man does not need your help. Let him go.
It's not possible to live with this body. It's impossible. Your skull is still in one piece, starting from the top and working its way down.
And then something happened. There has been something in you for a while now -- it's deep down a *soul* is waiting. A wait that's *always* on...
A nauseating ointment of chemicals, sweet with the nervous system.
The door is closed and locked.
"'Huh? Who is that?' he asks. 'Cuno's not here right now, he's fucking hard.' He means he's not."
The lieutenant nods. "This case takes up most of the book, so I won't be able to offer any suggestions. But I have a feeling there's something there, somewhere..."
She's right. They don't actually look like sports -- they're not even called sports -- but still.
"I'm pretty sure I can't.
Hold on! Are there any more of those out there for me, a flashing red light in the head?
You do realize he has a home in an apartment building West of this.
The crisp, white linen feels surprisingly soft. After a while, it starts to feel cold. Then it's no longer a jacket -- it's a glacier.
Yeah. Sure does look like a lot of people got shot in the art world too...
"Aye." She tilts her head. "But don't worry, Harry. I don't mean to pry, but it's a jacketed bullet close to 4 mm in diameter.
While she thought about the man-child for a moment, the lieutenant is still fiddling with his hair, chewing on some talcum powder...
"Good. It's bad. Where have you been all this time?"
Terrarium is a cooperative game developed by artists and engineers from the University of Waterloo and Fortress Accident. It's been played in dozens of annual tournaments held across the nation.
He's definitely lying. He was scared of you.
Wait, is he?
This proves the point. The lieutenant's un-impressed attitude is deliberate.
He smacks his lips. "*Wink* isn't really what you need, is it? Anyway, don't go projecting any of that *cool* stuff on *you*. Keep it real."
"Great. Thanks."
"Shut up, Mickey."
Too personal.
"I don't know, man. Who do you mean?"
"I really *want* to know.'' She looks around. "And where can I find all these mugs?"
The door to Room #2.
There is something here for later, you suspect. It's a *thing*. Check out those bulges in your pants and cock, *then* decide what to do.
Oh my god, that's terrible. You should've seen the back of her hand, right before the bullet *ended* it.
This place was meant to hold nothing but doom and gloom. But that's just how it is -- a small town gone wrong.
There's a heavyset man with unusually narrow shoulders. He looks like a Middle-Easterner, not an Old World bastard.
As you turn the dial, the already familiar voice speaks back: "11-13. North-West. Lower Transylvania Road, René Arnoux."
As your mind considers these options, you see a faint outline of a residential street grid appear before you...
The girl's chest rises and falls with each ring... the rings are connected by a small loop of fabric that appears to be drawn in a *line* at the back of the jacket.
"And how do you know that?"
I'm not even sure what that means, though. Don't you see the green stuff over there? No? Then maybe you're right...
Maybe you *are* slow?
(What?)
No. No. It can't be. It's just not true. Guess again.
In the bowl.
Whoa... *bratan*. That's so sweet of you. Here we are discussing the nicest booze you've ever had.
They're not there *yet*. You have to get there -- *soon* if you want to avoid ending up like this.
The scent of a thousand cigarettes rising from the corpse...
"No. I'm doing the right thing. This is what happens when I first meet one of these guys."
"Hmmmm..." There's a moment of silence.
As the man leans back in the chair, his eyelids open, a gust of wind blows through the blanket. The lights on the surface seem to be alive with life.
It is a dangerous line of questioning, but Kim's really soft.
"What do you think you're doing, detective?" He turns to you. "You're gonna die of a heart failure, aren't you? This ain't G.I. Joe, it's fucking painful!"
They didn't make it any more intense than
"Don't worry, we'll be back soon." [Leave.]
The story keeps repeating itself, the worse your memory and limited attention span.
You should have waited, you've gotten an eye for this. You'll get the next time.
With a flick of his eye, the lieutenant moves toward the man. His left hand grabs the gun holster...
The yellow pages turn inside out as you try to focus on the figurine. Only the abstract shapes seem to have any life.
What if you were to tie a gurney to one of the trees?
Being a cop doesn't *give* you the right to do anything; it *put[s] you in* the position of having to do something.
No one knows what to say to that. To keep the tension. Keep it light. Breathe.
"I don't know, pig. I'm not a fuckin' retcon artist."
You open the book to the library card catalogue. On the cover, a black haired character in a orange jumpsuit waves a wand at you. The card is addressed to "Harry Du Bois", just like the signature -- "Germaine van der Wijk".
She gives the illusion of permanence a chance to break, but it's not happening. Thoughts race through her mind, racing toward something... somewhere there is no time. Not anymore. You are lost.
"You need to get to the *inner core*. The core."
As the Mass Effect Ambassador scans the skies, the pedestrians keep their eyes on the motor carriages.
What if I don't have what I need -- what if I don't have *this* shit.
"Was there anything else
Examine closer.
"The following instructions are for your gun."
"It's not."
Over the course of two days the mayor investigates the crime scene and the ruins of the once great *renéu* emerge from the casino...
In his mind he's already thinking up some scaly contingency plan. You don't even have to think about it...
The hunch
He's played *his* hand. This is petty.
A moustachioed and mutton-chopped man, amateurishly depicted, gazes at you with sad eyes, a cigarette dangling from his mouth.
"This is exactly what *you* need." He looks at you with pity. "Take good notes, like you always
They're *not* actually that into him. It's not them you need to worry about, this is one of the many unsolvable mysteries in the universe.
"Yes, that's the song the girl has been dancing to all that time."
"He means the work I did. The scam. The murder investigation."
Hmmm... *Scary* perhaps?
"Like a tree, but..."
Even worse -- *Cuno*, his ugly child, is lying there, too, silently crying, too stupid to understand your torments. A petrified little boo to be confined to his mother's belly.
Somewhere in the unformed bow of a typical loony apartment wind chill, surrounded by unfurnished windows... A case files held in a drawers by the door. Two officers must be present for a routine traffic stop.
In some way you know it. You feel the tendrils of past lives -- like you're *missing* something. A spectral hand, like a thumbtack...
Here's some *funk* that *Vied* for glory and fortune: pulverised moon landing tribute. And the weirdest sax player in Jamrock. Meet me when you get the time.
Two empty bottles of '
There is a simian like that. It's waiting for the perfect moment to emerge.
"Ow..." the old woman screeches. "Why is this even *fucking*?"
"Some regs say it's for workers. But I don't have the authority to make such a ruling. The Union does."
"Why would she do that?"
(Mumtazoon) "Okay, okay... he's a rotten man now. He knows he can't fight the habit and so he's giving up *all* of it."
"...what would you say is your name?"
YOU'LL SURVIVE THIS! YOU'LL STILL WANT TO ENTER THE HARBOUR BAD -- YOU'LL WANT TO ESCAPE TO THE NEXT WORLDMOTHERFUCK YOURSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE BELOW.
There's *some* distance between here and Jamrock, but it's not marked by anything other than your lungs.
You were too quick to despair, son -- I said you crash into the concrete wall!
Pull the rope.
(Nod.) "Yes."
It's hard to tell exactly how old she is, but she seems to be younger than her mid-forties. If she's not a mid-life crisis, then at least she's a dead adult.
You can feel her, a little bit. Like you know someone. You're in a kind of trance, she's hovering right behind you...
That doesn't sound good.
At the end of the day, you don't *need* a gun. There's no need for that. The world is too harsh.
You were too pushy last time. Think this through logically. If there's something you *could* do, then by all means do it.
"What I'm trying to tell you is, life
You slip the plastic ID card out of the loop and pocket it. The man on the platform steps back and says to himself: "Perhaps another
Wow, the waiter's *not* a... ghost.
"Hey. Is this a boy or a girl?"
It's a symbolic gesture -- showing respect. The Revacholian *supremacy* is the supreme legal body in the Land of the Seven Sages, whose decrees are supreme in land and who is supreme in name only?
Because you needed her in your life and she in yours.
"Yeah, I can see you're disappointed. But we don't talk about issues such as this on radio. Anyway, are we finished
You are super, super helpless now.
"Fine then."
This light-footed little fellow must have just woken up one morning -- no doubt just as the darkness before them.
No response.
In your hands you hold two game boards: a front-box and a back-box. The front box has a listing of games, while the back is bare of anything more substantive.
Surprisingly eloquent, really. The dicemaker seems to be helping him sort through these rough patches.
''That's a stupid way to do business, Kim.'' He looks toward the lieutenant. "You're in a superior occupation -- hiring like that... I'm not giving you the credit you could get for putting him on the ground."
You slip your fingers under the frozen lid, but the ice is too cold for you to get a good grip. A prybar would come
"No..." Her face is motionless. Her hands fall to her sides, as if exhausted from a long day of walking.
"Yes -- I have an epiphany. You are what you are. Anyway..."
I think I've heard enough.
"Of course you have -- you're an irreplaceable part of the shop's history."
How does a guy his age *fit* into a suit? And what does he say to this... gloating gleam of vapour? It's like standing in for an actor in a skiff drifting through the air...
"Actually, I've been thinking about giving you the nest box -- but I don't really want to..."
"It's not for sale. You'll never get it."
"Yes. It was him. He was having an inebriated woman upstairs."
That's incorrect. She's a student. She could be *in* the courtyard *right now*! You could talk to her, see what she knows...
Gone. In an instant. A rattle goes off your chest and you hear the handcuffs crackle. You're no longer trapped here, you're *already* off to jail.
The skeleton is actually quite impressive. Slimy mess.
They're too afraid to say goodbye. Besides, *it* is only a *conjurer* -- you and me both.
That sounds like it might be a good field for a movie set. Look at all those crates stacked against one another!
The clove is poised with the tip of the fizzing air, ready to rip into you with a thousand words.
He keeps the quiet.
That's no way to conduct a *business meeting*. You should either get a lawyer or change the subject.
"If it's not inside, then who is?"
"Why yes they are! He was looking for someone, no more. Someone! A piece of us he could use! A body part!"
"Well... it's going to be all right. She'll join our little club. One of us will be watching over you." The lieutenant nods to you.
"*Case closed*, officer
No. Not like she thinks.
You're surrounded. One bullet can't possibly do that.
A soft pang of pain.
"Fuck, man... what were you thinking?"
The lieutenant makes a note.
"Wait, why did she say that?"
An ornithologist is a person who studies or studies birds. Ornithology is an intense branch of the ornithological sciences.
Don't listen to this guy. He thinks you're pulling a prank on him. Maybe you should just ignore him? Anyway...
The Lieutenant will stash your toys.
The cracks are so pronounced they feel like teeth chattering.
Alright, but I'm a little hesitant. I think I'm ready to look past this intellectual shield.
"I don't even know what that was."
"Yes. Understood."
Maybe it's a good idea to just call him Egg Head? Don't make it sound like you're missing something!
You could listen to the tracks instead, see what they've got to say. Or just imagine it -- leaves rustling on your shoulder.
The governor hears you, his form tensed up behind the glass. A brief flash of rage blinds him to your passionate yelp.
"So, is it cold outside?"
A tune on loop... lovely and nostalgic, an echo of the *Reþór* era.
She's about to say *something*. Here it comes. She needs to cry, but she can't.

There is definitely perfume in the air. It's spicy, with a hint of ambrette, wafting through the bitter air of the cargo hold.
Except the cigarettes.
Like a pillow, the blanket feels cold, as though it's come from a distance. You don't hear any sound, but when you turn toward the room the light has already disappeared...
You take the legal documents out of the envelope: a 12-40 month construction period and the zoning plan in the addendum. In addition, you find a strangely bulging heart-ball.
The connection crackles, like burning paper. "Wait, can I read it now? I need to re-connect the book to the Wi-Fi..."
You feel something -- like a pair of killer bees sting your hand when you look at them. Glorious killing hands!
Tiago
You feel something -- like a small flower, resting on your chest. An irregular, yet passionate sort of sadness.
*Hang up, idiot! You have no idea who I am!* I'm not a rookie, I'm a cop!* I could fight for you!"
"Klaasje doesn't get us on this."
The expression on her face is still clouded over. It's as if she's trying to make you her lover. But you can't help it...
"Hence, the bottle and the faerie folk."
"I'm not gonna spend time on something that isn't important to solving the
But you don't have to. You've already proven yourself worthy enough. Next time you'll still make the best argument...
There's something in there. A warm wave passes him.
The brief stops on the coast add up to thirty years -- and the repetitions add up to at least two centuries.
Don't ever mention that *name*. You'll regret it, later -- later, on the road. When the carousel stops.
Yes, art is an expression of will and freedom. But freedom of expression is not the hallmark of a true patriot.
I didn't want to lie. I didn't care. Why would I *disappear*?
"*And* they ran. The worker's comp hadn't even been *issued* yet! There was nothing to give these kids. Inland Empire had become *immutable*..."
He picks up the metal with a *thunk* and looks at you with a frown. "Don't take it personally."
I am really sorry, sweetie. It's an honor to be here for all these guys. But you need to talk to her -- *if* you can.
"Indeed. It's impossible to describe the sound of those elements. They sound *too* subtle, yet somehow always present..."
It's unopened.
Kras Mazov (nom de guerre), was an economist and a theoretical historian. He was a leading figure in the Graad side of the Turn of the Century Revolution, where he headed the Nine Day Government. Mazov is considered the
"No. The Church sent you to see the church. She's a clever woman, but she's not very good at reading."
Listen to it.
He is troubled by your strange reverie. It's as if the past 7 years have brought the politician to his knees.
"Right, detective," he turns to you, with a pensive expression on his face. "What do we do now?"
Hold on, what *they* have gone through -- reconstruct them? From scratch? From your memory...
"No, I'm a communard and that's it."
"I think he was a drummer for the Coalition. Then he left and joined the Moralintern. In the wake of the Revolution. I don't remember his exact plans, but he was a critical thinker."
"Got it. Let me ask -- who's the mysterious woman who's dragging her clothes around, by the way?"
The name "Kim 'Pinball' Kitsuragi" appears before you.
"Okay. But where did he get it?"
He's genuinely concerned now.
He does *not* know what that means.
It's good. You should have it.
Stop the world from falling into darkness. End it. Forever.
Tits are fine, but they're not *you*-- they're the old man. And everyone else on this earth.
You think I've forgotten where I am. Why do I keep coming back to this window?
Don't say you weren't. You were *completely* confident before. Now you're not so sure. But cool, cool.
A bloody thrill flows through your nerve endings. The legs of the fallen robot are shaking as your mind attempts to connect the dots between the events of the past 48 hours...
"I'm sorry to interrupt your cop show," the man says. "But are you here to arrange the transfer of the cigarettes?"
"Yeah, Tequila. The schmucky one."
Read the fifth entry.
Blink!
What you're suggesting is, well... it's not actually *done* on purpose. It's *not* nice to be able to ignore all that.
"I think we should ask her about this."
The gun has to be reloaded after every one, two -- or in your case three -- shots are loaded from the magazine. You're smart.
"Yes, you're right. The house in the back is the only door open. Why not the rest of them?"
"Okay, great. What else do you need?"
"That's all well and good, but I want to know about *me*. Who am I? What do you want?"
"No," she whispers. "I really am."
Like fireflies, the sudden appearance of the occasional tear streamers in the water column. A total lunar eclipse, and the Martinaise storm. A sickening odour that grows stronger the closer you stand to the water line...
I've seen the man with the striped shirt and all of his *challenging*. I know of dangerous jobs. Don't let anyone scare you.
I have no idea. It's impossible. There's something out there, behind the glass... The movement of the liquid is also strange...
"I still don't understand how this ended up in your hands. I thought you were more of a *cop*."
He stares at the embers, then suddenly a look of disappointment overtook him. "Well... he's probably still not gonna do it."
"It's hard to say." She takes a long drag. "I don't mean to sound *naive*, but what is the *CPI*?"
This means you could have found *some* problems with the contraption itself. Even the boys in the basement got their chances.
But for when the lieutenant isn't here... listen on in, he'll *do* the talking.
He sees it. The King's Head and the six-story tower on the plazaward. In the dark, under the motorway, the Dream Team works.
Sure, why be interested?
It's just a little. A *pin*, like in the formula. There is no *rewind* in the repeating image.
He looks like a young tree, gaunt and sad, but also strangely convincing, as though he were performing a seancesaint.
With his foot firmly planted on the asphalt, the kid shifts his attention to the bright future of pot stickers.
What a strange choice of words... What did you expect? This is the R&D room, you were the guy who said *do* things.
"I'm an experimental man, experimenting with new drugs. You don't know everything.''
Behold, all of this rage and violence has not caused him to become cynical about life. It has merely made him stronger.
"*And* you left me hanging like a coward. This is just how I am. Don't be stupid, Harry. I'm trying to be... just*."
To *not* sound like some sort of ass. The word's not even in your vocabulary. You're full of shit, that's why.
They're in the quest of defending their turf. That's why they carry so much weaponry.
Your hand moves but a millimetre or two away from the corpse, laughing until the power wears off...
"And let me know if you do, right away, Kim. I'm not in any hurry to get these tapes."
You quickly identify the three basins, filling in the blanks with your hand signals. The callsigns on the back are
Okay... so that's *your* fault. Fine.
Your voice echoes on the water. The bather feels it too, her lungs taking a pounding as her heart beats beat grows weaker.
"I'm very sorry, ma'am," the lieutenant quickly interjects. "*You* are under arrest for the murder of the
It's as if he can't decide whether to be angry or not with you. Which means either of you are lying.
"Hey, I still got some speed."
She has! All those pages you found -- this one tiny slip of paper you hold in your hand. Every page has a name and a number that tell stories -- sides, events, loops, and reads like a poorly made story.
She shakes her head, then breathes in.
Another day, another dead body. Maybe it's your cell, maybe it's your soul, maybe it's your cargo lashing cargo lashing cargo lashing cargo lashing...
You've found a reasonable explanation for the dicemaker's cap. Well done.
"And a blue one." He grins. "You know what's great?"
Above, in smaller font, you see the woman's nipples have just begun to swell from the exertion.
"Can I come in? You look like shit."
There are parts of this world you've *never* been to.
A similar device might have been present at the crime scene.
You're thinking it, but your mouth is mute and your tongue moves in a *language* only you can understand.
Your hands feel sticky, for some reason.
"Okay, officer. I don't want to do this any more." [Leave.]
IT'S A *FIASCO*, BRATAN!
There's a hint of *awe* in his voice, when he says he was "merely joking".
Across the room, the heating system hums its soft lullaby. The mattress feels soft and sheets warm. It only takes you moments for the world to fall away...
"I'm sorry,
"I guess that's what the flatulence feels like."
It's bad, really bad. The cold winter wind keeps the light warm, but occasionally your vision obscures the silhouette of the man inside.
An *unbelievable* mass of papers suddenly seems to have *weight* on your mind. You manage not to move your hand or even notice it's presence.
It's an optical phenomenon. The object absorbs some of the *sheen* cast from the night before. The object also makes the sky darker...
"Oh, I'm looking for Ruby again, Kim."
That's because he doesn't *hate* the hard stuff. He just doesn't have the mental power to say it.
This art collector... is probably on to you. He's watching over him. We can do it. Open up -- really *crucial*.
He scratches his head. "Discovery of Insulinde left a mark on him -- he had to grow up fast or die trying to find a cure."
A pitiful cannonball in front of the OSHA building, falling into the sea -- this is more than 30 years after the war ended
To the left of the croissants and juice bottles, several packaged raincoats fill a low shelf. One is missing. No one needs you when there's money to be made.
The most beautiful object in the world? The most beautiful - he means *the curse*.
No, not here. Not on Eminent Domain. Not on the coast of Revachol. Nope. Not on Florina. Nope.
"Who are these *mulkkus* -- are they not legitimate?"
Look, *anyone* can do it -- this is not going to be a "she said", it's going to be you saying it.
The boy breathes on the glass, ash falling from the grey sky above, the wind rustling his hair.
As that sweet sweetness fades away, your mind can only conjure up images: some dimly remembered vision of *fuck the world*, while others seem to have more flesh on them -- maybe this is some kind of exit wound?
Most impolite cop-show theory yet.
"I have business with Evrart."
Ignore it. Just what are you going to do about it? Take his picture and sing it to your heart's content?  It'll be all right, he'll forgive you.
"No, it's not. It's dangerous."
Fucking idiot.
L'origine du disco! Such a powerful conceit, and this is why we can't *officially* operate it. You should at least
Well, then -- this is where you get to be cruel... Will you be a detective in training?
There is *no* fury in her voice -- the word has left her lips in a spray of spit and excitment.
"I think I understand now." He looks around the room, feeling slightly reassured by the answer.
Don't talk, listen to the bird.
Just like that, instinct took over -- a reflexive one. You close your eyes, and it's still there -- a stick insect at the end of its limb. Spinning...
"No." He shakes his head.
That fucking ice harpy! You're scum, ain't you? With a fuckin' gun!
A yard. Rain falls onto the roof of a woodshed. Filthy water pools around a body. Droplets of rain start to form on the dead man's cheeks. A strange fascination with the world around him.
...it will solve everything.
"I don't know. He said he's a fucking legend. A *major*. In the fucking -- and then took a bath." He stares into the little doo-poo.
You find no sign of life on the woman's lower lip. No worm-like extinctions -- this must have been a silly thought.
Suddenly, out of nowhere, a goosebumps thump against your back. It's the sound of a spring thump, the goosebumps increasing in pitch as the worker suspended motor carriage A warm column of air is released, carrying the saffron cloak and others...
"Have you seen me around there?"
"From when was this *fight* started?"
You might have to rouse the old one from sleep, Potter. You've probably done that before.
It feels as though he's about to burst out in laughter, all the energy of the ferocity and the sharp tongue he's been using to tease you.
Yes. It's painful to even think about. You were supposed to take the coffin with you -- that was all the answer was...
"That doesn't seem right."
The many centuries old cold front continues for a moment more, as though frozen, before it cools to a solid -40 degrees C.
"This *magazine* I'm picturing here is *way* more boring than I thought. You've never smelled it
The road ascends; a raised motorway paralleling the motorway, the ruins of the Concession Highway razor wire fluttering in the breeze...
There is nothing left to add. Stop wasting time and go.
Stop.
Yes, these exact same footprints can be seen in the archives. *Have* you opened them all?
You hear a faint scream -- a woman's. Then the sound disappears, like someone pressed STOP on the tape. The woman is gone. So is Kim. Then the whole world disappears...
One *reasonable* conclusion to draw is that it's primarily the musing of a young man on the precipice of some sort of mountaintop career.
He points to the Pacific island. "And -- so you'll never find out what happens. Until tomorrow, when I'm gone. And you'll wake up, and the world will be *empty*. Look, I'm gone. And you're still mad."
Cleaning up after yourself seems to have *some* kind of effect on your mood. Maybe you should try talking to him about the
Don't hold your breath.
She just stands there, frozen.
"I believe he died of a gunshot wound."
Oh yeah. You were about to say it's impossible. But then you thought about it and now he's so angry at you he doesn't even *want* to
Breathless, he tries to steady his breathing.
She scoffs. "Isn't the Union big business? It's *super rich*."
Look at it, take it. How long has it been since you've had any *control* over anything? You have been relegated to the margins, relegated to making  irrelevant  comments. The most *polite* thing you can do is offer bullshit.
Rubbish! You're a *funk* rock star. Why are you wasting your time standing in a *waste'?
"How many more are there?"
The corner of the small man's mouth twitches.
begins with a |~$120,~$130,~$140,~$150,~$160 mark. The last one is ~$170.
Only the black energy sub-races remain unaccounted for; it seems that the high explosives give them the best chance of survival.
He feels something akin to pity. He feels pity even for the record company -- it's the company's fault.
Get a hold of yourself! It's not a small thing! The remains of a camp on a lake, in a game forest, in a sea of shifting colours -- this was all too real to be a prank.
"I'm pretty sure I've already figured out the person who did it."
You should have kept your eye on that window, on Kim's back patio, instead of storming downstairs. You should have kept your eye on that window. *Real* nice and dark, *SPLIT*!
The Seagull finds its own kind. And it puts a dead bird in the fridge.
He's still laughing, very deliberately. "Well, this has to be something the lieutenant who took my boot prints really liked, because when he left he said they looked *impressive*. We should *look* at it again, before we *do* it again.
"I've almost earned you a single beer."
He smiles. "What makes you think we're gonna do it? No idea, Chevalier. But we *should* try."
You're shivering because of a mild to moderate case of the hangover. If you drink this you will
"Isn't it true you don't remember your *expiration date*?"
"I think I was born to do this. You wouldn't have been put in the... potty when I was in primary school."
There is an emergency switch on the side of the cylinder block ceiling. It
You already are: the cybernetics and electrical engineering graduate. You just need to *enter* here.
"...the most beautiful, the most adventurous, the most *inventive*."
"Ooh, detective. That's some lovely language. So...
"That's insane, Titus."
Indeed. So very few people actually died as a result of your pamphlet display, and the majority -- probably more like 95% -- would rather have seen it.
On the islet? There is almost nothing there. But that doesn't mean there isn't anything.
Just show her the badge.
"Okay, so you don't know what to do about *me*. Let's get the fuck out of here."
"Stop calling me 'sir' and 'ma'am' and... talk to me -- if you see something interesting, ask."
In addition, this font features many unusual symbols: The Semenine Islands (and even the name of one of them, Les Fruits de Fond, a remote island chain in the Societe Frisique) all have special meanings for you.
She whispers: "It's important to emphasize: we weren't planning on *telling* you this. We don't need your permission."
Squeeze in...
Not you, *imbecile*. You're not a *fleischraeder* any more. You're an imbecile.
He smiles and
A scrawny old back sees you approaching. Is he confused? A dirty alliance of industry will never work with you.
The boy studies the fridge. "Ah. Right. Simon and Garfunkel live in a shed behind the Union box. You can hear *the smell* of alcohol coming from there. If there's anything I can do... *maybe* you should ask him about the hangover."
I can see you caught between nerves. Overhearing the lieutenant's words, your eyes traced his every motion. Surely there's more to it...
This doesn't add up. I didn't win the game, I didn't pass the test... how are you supposed to know?
But, he thinks, it *is* important to remember that we're still in phase. Part of his was supposed to take place in Revachol. In Revachol West. But that just couldn't be proved.
"I'd rather have a
What *is* this? Why are you trying to *connect* this puzzle with the case? Don't you have a *case* to solve? Why isn't this case making *sense*?!
"Why didn't you grow up to be a racist?"
It's cold and it feels rough to touch... Is the flicker of vision just your mind trying to say *What was that?!*?
A coincidence?
Yes, you. You are the Man of Jealousy.
Disintegrating into mathematical equations? Or are you just *the book*? You're not very good at this -- much less so at evading gunfire.
The position you are in does not give you an indication as to what to expect on the other side...
The lieutenant gives you a long, slow shake of his head.
Below the pandemonium, above the fighting -- even the dead bodies -- there is something far away, on the other side of the screen...
In his mind, either way the psychic core is communicating its message, he's gonna take it.
The creaking sound is the hammer of a hammer, honed to a crenel. The yellow star has been replaced by a series of cryptic texts.
There is *a lot* of stuff in there, he thinks -- most of it in the two litres. But what you find is unlikely to fit into the *one true* format he prefers.
"A number of cryptids have been reported. Also: errant pet, dead body syndrome."
Perhaps I shouldn't rush? Before you say something, ask it again. This was a real low blow.
A fleeting memory comes over you, a dark one, as you stand in the apricot-coloured light of the window.
Oh my god, YES! *Fuck off*?! I don't know... Why are you *doing* this? Are you ashamed of asking these questions?
"Just grab one of those mugs, Kim."
The feeling was too strong not to *rip* through those glasses. Then --  your nose did the rest of the job for you.
Not only did the booth keep the entire grid at a distance -- it also showed you the worker's back. It's all black except for its flag and insignia.
In the window that threatens to fall down, however, there is a figure in the falling snow. You can hear her howl.
In the middle of a two story box of dung -- where the dung-remnants hang out -- there's a rhetorical flourish that might make sense only once you know the full context.
"Something about the way you move..."
In the far corner: CONFRONT and JUMP -- your names, your addresses, the forms of government of Revachol, along with a list of each municipality. There's a button to your left, just out of reach...
"C'mon. You are a homicide detective. It's not your intention to mislead."
"*That* guy is probably laughing his head off now. He's probably gonna be *smiling and smoking* now too."
Look at Kim harder.
He looks at you with obvious surprise. "I didn't expect you to take such an interest in our work here, officer."
This is the Workers' Central. Hourly slaves hand over their daily struggle to a gruff man in his late fifties.
"Okay, fine. I'll just call them, and they'll come pick it up for me. They've been doing that a while, right here." He takes a small bundle of magnetic tape off the list, waves it around, then turns to you.
If *by dint* you mean *they missed him...
Your voice echoes on the water. The lieutenant coughs and turns to you. "Please -- is that all?"
To the lieutenant's puzzlement, you spend the next several hours actively working on the case. You consult the books, study the evidence, present your case, solve the case...
"Told you you he wouldn't be taken care of." The rat-man sighs and slowly shakes his head.
"No problem, detective. But I'm wondering if you have any information on the whereabouts of that particular Meijer-Smit, or any information on my relative, the Hermenegildo Hoof."
As he shifts uncomfortably, a series of clicks, like the clinking of glass beads against one another as they roll across a hardwood floor.
The kid's pants are really warm. You could literally go to any public restroom and change into any private room in there.
You should taste some.
Does he *mean* anything?
God, the poor woman must have things to worry about.
Still, interesting. The fact remains that you've been drinking, he thinks. This *illness* must have been a *small* inconvenience to him, but he'll never know now.
"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying."
The two sides of the board are marbled with chemical runoff from the motor lodge. You smell it coming in through the chimney.
Heaps of leaves are rotting among the mud-cake towers. Dozens of little locusts feed on them, buzzing away with vicious joy. The kid on the left is chewing on a piece of leaf by the phasmid.
You were a sad drunk who bought an ugly tie -- who gives a shit! Everyone is going to die because our plan failed. I have *no idea* how you're gonna get out of this. No idea.
"Oh, and you tried to sell me the gun
What a fucking joke! Why are you *not* getting his joke? Ask some other question and see if you can get him to agree.
"I'll leave that call for the station."
In the reeds, where the phasmid was hiding, you see a large number of locusts shuffling around.
"Who or what are you? Your eyes, your name... How did I get here?"
Read about the pygmies.
Somewhere on the outskirts of Faubourg, a dust mite hit the garden wall, making an *unpleasant* sound. There's a *sick feeling* in your stomach...
Don't worry. As captain of the local harbour side, you are officially in command of the ICM, and thus the command area.
"How many people do you think are missing?"
"It's the same thing every time we run the file system -- it makes us look like a band of vipers..." She looks up to you. "There's no shame in that."
"Good. Now, about the actual bullet..."
He looks at you. "And who is this  you? I've seen the RCM before. You seem familiar somehow. We should talk about the Klaasje incident maybe? I know you and I can get along..."
You could poke around in the tent. See if Evrart has any personal belongings.
His shoulders are hunched, yet he keeps it together. This man would be proud to be called a `man`.
He gives you a moment of silence. Then he speaks: "I saw a guy touch a guy in a yellow shirt and the shirt is outrageously loud, so I walked away."
You have little idea what she means. It's fastidiously written, like someone typed it up on her behalf -- and then hand-wrote it, possibly using ink that's not public domain.
"What's up with his shoulders?"
Over the decades, Graad has come to be known as the Great Underpass of the Sahel -- a vast urban sprawl caused by careless emigrants pouring sand across the border. This is the northern terminus of a long-for
To your left, the lieutenant considers your actions -- a little relieved you didn't spill the beans too early.
He shrugs. "It's not a particularly large caliber rifle, but it's an expensive model, so it naturally comes with a gun. Of course, it wouldn't be real."
She's silent for a second... then she speaks again: "Maybe I can line you up next to the track again, like you did before..."
"Stop provoking this guy with his anger issues."
"And all because you are a FALN A-6. What a bunch of jackasses..." He frowns. "I like FALN anyway, but..."
Shaved after pheromones.
Sort of -- but... you shouldn't lean on that old leg of yours too heavily, just because you've remembered it's your name.
Do you know how long it will take to play this game? Try playing for a week straight and you'll feel like a *Garte*, if you hadn't noticed.
"Alright, but..." He doesn't know what to say. "What does *wompty-ghost* mean?"
"A pistol that shoots several rounds. Does that sound like something you'd use?"
"I'd like to turn the tide against you... as part of a larger *intervention*."
Still, your endurance test is a success. You were able to stay up all night, despite the
She gestures toward the huge statue of Filippe the VIII standing in the square behind the Royal Balcony. "Here he comes!"
"Oh, those 'legendaries'. They're so cool. I've been tempted to sign up myself, but I've always... been too *full* to think it through."
The lieutenant gives you a long, suspicious look. He's pretty sure this is personal information Kristoff has collected from the missus.
You get the feeling she won't tell you about anything on the phone when you ask her. That's *not* the way she is supposed to be dealing with stuff.
Yes, but he *wants* to know what's in the compartment.
A habitually, casually lapsing personality...
You punch the door twice more -- twice more, each time leaving a little indentation on the doorframe.
It's almost impossible to describe how this feeling feels. It's like some predator is laying its eggs in your brain.
This is like a nice little surprise. Maybe the suspect didn't do it.
He looks at you worryingly. "Don't worry, lieutenant, it's quite all right. No need to be scared. No need to be *crazy*. What were you thinking? Ha-ha, brilliant. Now lets go."
"I've got nothing."
"We're still running through it, Kim," the lieutenant says as he surveys the pile. "Good stuff, pig."
"I think you might be the only one here today, detective." He looks up, waving his beer around.
The tension is palpable. The cop tries to come up with something to say to you -- but it's all he can do not to drop his voice.
She's done a fine job too. A real cop would *not* fly so close to home -- no one trusts a police officer.
You hear the murmur of blood in your ears. A grim discovery -- the remains of a life lived long ago, when mankind was stronger.
"Modding the game is *not* our main concern, is it?" He stares into the canister with a pensive expression.
The *real shit* is considerably less intoxicating than the one the young man purported to smell.
He nods. "I have no doubt about the case, detective. It's an international investigation. Anything else I can do for you is your choice. I have no more questions."
The tape recorder lies idly on the floor, forgotten like a discarded toy. Three men in brown suits sit behind the reception desk, their backs hunched. One of the men, a short, spindly finger, points at you.
He nods thoughtfully, tapping his finger on his cigarette. "I suppose it is not a very good place to ask such a thing, officer."
A small, terrified smile quivers on her face as she hears your ominous tone. Then a while later she sees your ugly mug in her drunk eye.
"You're a bad dad, Harry."
It's an optical disambiguation. Forgery obviously.
"That's too much. I don't want this."
"Shame on you! You're afraid to ask me questions -- and you're worried I'll just give you the *shit* you want."
This feels... dangerous.
The scar on your neck is hard to make out, but you can make out a "Rembrandt" stamp, the lower
Also, the lamp you're standing under has *somehow* been enchanted out of you. You won't be able to sleep at all, not today, not tomorrow...
The little treat they give you is what gives you the *terror* you haven't felt in a while. Makes you shudder.
Her mind is clearly elsewhere.
And then he hears it. The lashings of the media. The hammerings of protesters. Protected from the vision of the past -- but seen, somehow, through the smoke and mirrors of the present.
It's hard to say. It's not like he's attracted to you or anything, but he is *kind* of surprised at your *discrepancy*...
It's almost like something *stoic* is happening to the bird -- it's beginning to form words, to express itself. It's not just another superstition.
"Huh, someone who's never been in a fight, huh? Who's never got into an altercation? That seems about right."
"Sure, you're not doing anything wrong. Please just give me some speed."
He senses disappointment. He was hoping that with some of the *exhaustion* of the investigation *he'd* become *more* interested in it.
"Do
"Oh, the fucking legend of the Button Factory!" She almost starts laughing. "There are legends -- people calling out to it in the night. My husband has the radio. It's on the 7:20 AM local time zone. He says it was all part of some big scam!"
"Did you and the defendant make love?"
You jump over the bag, bag, bag it. You can feel the impact as it hits the wood.
"I had another question for you."
Believe it!
Blink.
There is *nothing* more to do now. You've done enough.
"I don't really have a comment on these things." (Conclude.)
"We should move. There's nothing more we can do." He turns to you: "What's it going to be?"
"Worry about your health, if you're not gonna look into it?"
Of course. And in case the suspect was in *rare* cases -- no small feat in a *city that's mostly filled with them*...
Perhaps the most *impressive* of all the species, the endangered Major Majestic cockatoo was once believed to have an extremely low incidence of being killed in the
The bed is still cold from the broken window. To your right is a pair of face-glasses.
Please add another slice, please add another...
What are you doing, it's *officially* on *senior citizen mode*. You can't just ask for directions *anywhere*.
"Maybe. I don't know. Some *suspects*."
"They're gone now, sir." She sighs. "Somewhere down the coast, I'm afraid."
A hot flash burns in your hypothalamus -- the pituitary is firing up. Push it, boy, do it, glory in your craziness!
...where?
Okay. This looks good. It would be *strange*, though. The ants are stoically reproducing by spermatid species and, consequently, are constantly looking for a new source of insect-hosts.
When this district was booming, a young woman named Summer L'Engle opened a shoe manufactory on her premises. This was five years ago.
God, *your* brain. You put so much trust in it that you believed the worst about it. This has to be one of the reasons why he's unprofessional with the search.
IT'S ALL YOURS.
The stained glass window is covered with crushed up glasses and ruined photographs.
A rusting toolbox and a rat-licking grin.
That's a 3.62 calibre sniper rifle. There's a lot of gaps between the cracks, but *only* the most recent development in the bullseye is evident.
The absence is palpable. You feel like there's something up there, if you just look...
Why would the dark be so *sublime*? It's not like it adds anything to your otherwise superb formal skills.
"It's a problem for the Union, but we can't force him
The bell-like thing clatters to the floor and then sits there like a tossed potato, being watched over by some invisible insect.
"There are maps of this city and the parts of it you've visited. Please complete a statement."
The carriage keeps speeding down the street, on a quest for honor and glory.
"Kim, did you just say..." The small one hesitates, looking for the right words.
You *are* capable, he thinks. So do I. I'll do my best to make sure you have a brain-trained pal at your side.
She is serious. She does not want to give you information that might affect the integrity of her professional relationship.
"Why not? To turn the tide in Martinaise, which, by the way, is turning really badly."
Her mouth is open. Like a mouth can expand. "But you're still... investigating me?"
Concentration makes you squint your eyes. Your name should be deep gold and orange, like a focus...
You pick it out of the  grinder, rattle it like a drill, then push the box back down into the cold sea.
There is nothing you can do. But you *will* try to think of something. Let's try not to do anything foolish.
You should check it out, see what it's like to be him.
The Reader is a tiny mechanism that connects you to your local library. The Mechanism is attached to the base of the reader and consists of a spring loaded clutch and a pulley system.
I do *not* understand.
And my name, /swish-swish
You do feel a twinge, but it's only a mild one. The *pale imitation*. The pale imitation is near. Does not dare to speak its name.
"I know I'm a lorry driver. And you're a lorry driver -- how could I have gone wrong?"
"We do our best, Kim." (Go for it.)
[Stop thinking about it.]
In some buildings key is still in the ignition, the fire breather extinguished with a cigarette. In the middle of the flooded streets a cold gust of air drenches the building, sending shivers through the men and women who stay there...
More like a curse. The memory causes her to go deeper into her nightmares than she would like.
He appears resigned to the notion, but there's no room for doubt -- he's being *neglected* here.
"There *has* to be a way to kill all of these bad ass police killers in an explosion of pain and fear."
You hold the bouquet of flowers by the dried branches. "Thank you," she says, as you take the flowers apart with the beads.
But then it seems they *pawned off* their stake in this "fiasco" -- to the residents of Martinaise for their help.
A million boot-like cracks go up the giant letters of Vöws. Your boot fits perfectly, each time.
You've unlocked the door.
It's a small wonder her name is so famous. Even less mysterious is her connection to the Filippian Madonna.
A complete and total *no-no*. Don't say it.
Then -- and only then -- does the man begin to suspect foul play. His trademark stretch jersey is soaked with mud and he emerges from the shower with a grisly necktie around his
"The left is obsessed with identity politics, run by people who think they have a right to determine what kinds of people are human. I am more of a traditionalist. I like to *be*."
"I'm sorry I wasn't more forceful."
"The fifth Hardie boy... he died of a heart attack a few days ago. He had already fallen behind in his class at school and that 'Pissf******t' he said he would come back for? It's all gone now."
Don't worry. You shouldn't have started drinking, *bratan*, even if you could get the liquor token thing going.
Close the lid.
"Oh, I know. I'm not surprised. I've always suspected that you've been *lying* to me..." She takes a deep breath.
What is there?
That is the Seal of Innocence Lost.
He means that I should be willing to make the most of my chances. The lieutenant keeps his eyes on you.
Her face flushes with excitement, but it quickly recedes into the balustrade, as she's doing so:
"Oh yeah? No, I wasn't, I was just thinking about how much I like that sound. I can still get the old man's permission for a moment." He looks away. "I won't be doing it any more. I *am* too busy."
The compact tape player rattles against the tape player's box. It's not working. You barely hear the music through this rattle.
He sighs deeply. "I will never *un-pwned* him, no matter how much time it takes. People ask too much when I'm not here..."
The lead programmer glares at you. "I hope you're *not* just wasting my time with this stupid *hypothetical territory*. Consider the morality of this kind of advertising decision."
A group of marble pleurants still part ways in the long narrow alleyway. The plaza is silent except for the occasional rat sniffing around.
Hate advertising, you old coward. The public pisses only make the *problem* worse. Revachol fucking does not need your help.
No, you don't have to do anything. You're an old man and all.
"Easy, fellas. Mr. Dros is dead. I think he doesn't do that much any more -- but Mr. Claire has been out since last Sunday and that's how bad he is. If you've been out here -- seen him? I doubt it." He looks around.
"Alright. Okay. We're on it, detective."
You try to jolt back to life, but the brain hurts. Your eye is in the galaxy far away -- in the shape of a corona exploding star.
You've *rightly* gone through this -- multiple times.
Your hands have done the talking. Whether you like it or not, this friendship thing has really taken a toll on you.
All you hear is static and some distant gunshot. The perpetrator seems unaware of the existence of this
Don't just jump to the folder! Don't do that. Look into the damn thing, see what it's made of.
Punched the little ice bear's head.
The chill winds blowing in from the bay give her flesh a chance to do something -- to *remember* she's a police officer.
"Fuck you, I have no idea..."
"Fuckin' coulda been..."
Of course, it's only a *reasonable* solution. Maybe you should just *not* go to the island? Or... you know, in a different city?
This is a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse. Do you know what happens if you lose your nerve and hit the button that starts the infernal laughter that threatens to consume the world?
This is one of the few remaining visual images that has survived the deluge. The others have all melted into a thousand different perspectives. The former masters of this kind of visual poetry are rare.
C'mon, is that your game face? You can't even *scoff* at
"Huh?" His interest is immediately piqued. "Yeah -- you. I was listening to some of the stuff you had to say and I thought you looked *a lot* like Max Schmaltz. He's got it now. All manly."
"I'm gonna keep it for you. Just give me a little longer..."
"An accident, you say? I'm used to that now. Stuff like that *and* my name? My name has *always* been Titus."
It's impossible to tell if he's joking. He's obviously extremely stressed out.
"What? Can you just give me the key?"
Don't let her close her eyes.
He's afraid.
She breathes a silvery cloud of cigarette smoke out of her nostrils. The air turns to ether, then back to the sea.
The old man stares at you in disbelief. "This is beyond what I could have done..." He looks to the boy with big brown eyes, then to you. "You're not the gardener's boy
Her lovely features is brushing aside the poor student under the bridge. The moist, coppery cheeks of the teacher are all that stands between you and the classroom storm.
How does she know you're a cop?
Punched it, but not hard.
"I already have some. I've got everything I need." (Reach for it again.)
"No -- I'm not a dataproject or a worck."
An evil echo... love... screaming... what comes out of your mouth?
It doesn't matter. No one cares. A series of clicks, a sigh, and the phone hanging up. Sooner or later the computer will cave in, and once it does, the answers will be all but obvious.
Are these the hallucinations of some lost cause? Perhaps it's a case to look into later when he's *not* here...
(Laugh). "Let's not linger, shall we
She has already taken it off. The fur around the instrument makes the rag don't look particularly friendly. There is a small coil of red plastic in the centre of the headstock. There's an elastic material that wraps around the neck and around the sword hilt.
"Uhm, what do you mean?"
Now... is the last thing he needs is more antagonism. Straighten him out, *modern* officer.
"So do I. And I should thank you again, Mr Dros." His smile widens. "For everything you do for the martial
This is also one of her last acts as a citizen. Before she leaves, she wants to make sure you know -- that she's not about to rest easy.
"I agree," the lieutenant reads, looking down at his notes.
There's more to his disdain than mere admiration. Deep down, the man knows Cuno's not the smartest. But the big question always gets him -- what would he do if I told you the truth about the cryptid?
"They were named because the road was so bad. And, well, they didn't do any more."
There's about an A-Z of things wrong with you right now -- but maybe that's what happens when you first start racking your brains?
No. We got here by ignoring the obvious.
The bed is too cold for you to be of any use on this world. The sheets are made of reeds, as they have been for quite some time.
"Doesn't look like you have an open thing going in there, officer. I can't give you access to the place. It's private property."
Kim wants him to keep things professional.
Maybe you could *rewrite* history... rewriting history. Just to *plaisance*? It'd be ridiculous, would it? Besides, there's no way Finn and shit is real!
You should sing that sad song you were listening to earlier, when the lieutenant first introduced the concept of the Cuno...
He turns to you. "Besides, I'm not sure we have much of a case here. No one saw anything suspicious in your room. If it were, I would have come back here."
She was there that night, exactly where she heard the shot. And *still*! Standing right by the gas light -- looking up at the burning building.
He *knows* you have no business with the lieutenant's chalk-drawn map. He gives you a pensive look. "I wouldn't be of much use to you, officer."
With a quick motion the lieutenant stops your hand before your palm opens. "What would you do, officer?"
Like a nervous cat, the cat does not belong in the usual *danger* zone. It belongs in a *training* box.
"What happens, Klaasje?"
"Right, Kim. Okay. I won't do it again. Please let me and my partner, Elliot, handle it."
Your heart burns. All you can see is the hellish distortion it's making on the corpse's face.
"Tell me about the *joke*."
It'll take a few moments for the mix to reach optimal condition, but once it does, the disc is yours. The mix has a LUMINOUS sound that's unlike anything you've ever heard before.
Maybe she was hiding from something? You don't have the *stamina* to ask that now, but you will one day. When you get the time.
"I haven't thought about this -- and I definitely won't ever consider it again." He stares at you. "You're in a *deep* loop of depression, Kim. I'm sorry this is what you have to tell yourself to keep it in."
"These guys are backstabbers. They're gonna be back." He says to you, but the words leave his mouth as he turns to the lieutenant. "Don't mess this up."
Although the map is *not* very useful in your case, you might be able to find it one day... later, maybe?
It's going to be very difficult for a human being to just leave a trail in this dirt. It's not as if *traffic cop* is an honour anymore.
*There is.* Of* this world. Of... these apes in a room full of mirrors.
The wall still needs to be repaired, you can't open it now.
Put the gun in your mouth
"Uh... *someone*..."
The *Pale Moon* is probably also referencing the passing of General Fournier, who used to run the show there -- a Genovese political prisoner.
"I'm fine, just... a little stuff here. The fridge is *important* -- but you'll figure something out."
Okay, he keeps it together -- still in there, trying to come up with a convincing explanation. *Now* is not one of them.
She tries to look out her twin's long way behind, into the office behind the glass. But the glass keeps splitting in her face.
"I'm not that kind of cop."
"Aguades, those are the initials of the non-residents. The majority of them are here, but..." She looks around, slowly shaking her head, "there's a small contingent that's here... it's *out there*."
"There is." She looks down at her legs. "The soil quality survey says there are two wells in the village of Revachol. The large one and the small one. They were supposed to be *plugged* before the landslide."
"Hey, did you know that most plants do not have sex lives?"
A drop of sweat runs down your nose and in it you see the Martinaise inlet, wrapped in the night. In the abandoned church, crickets chirp.
"The law says you have to be at the
Listen, the bridge belongs to tech. It used to be one of the four main routes into the city, before the generator destroyed it.
As if the posters themselves are some kind of metaphor -- a bunch of tethered together by the stupid Cordilleran halo.
"I'm not your bitch, Harry. You don't abuse that title."
You hear that? The lieutenant's about to unfurl his heart in front of the hunchbacked surfer? Check out that spread! It's in your "to do" list!
"We met some local boys. Their boss was kind enough to let us into the yard for an inspection."
In the cafeteria, behind the food trucks, the seemingly never-ending *barbecue*. Maybe it's a sign... or a *symbol*?
You can actually see it -- the lieutenant's badge around her *shudder* now. Was that a *TRUE*?!
You are a jigsaw of muscle and bone. It takes a while for the whole to come together -- the moments between. Still, you did your best.
That is so frustrating.
No. You were prepared. It was powerful enough.
It's hard to put your hand down. The room feels different -- colder, more humid than you'd imagine.
"You look like me. I like your music, Harry. And your movies."
To really crack the case, you'll need to descend into more *deep* and *wondering* territory. Don't worry, hunched over a block of ice, reading this will be easier said than done.
"Wait. We're talking about the crime scene. Not like a journalist. As part of our *policing*."
Her fingers are sliding back and forth.
He blows a steady stream of smoke. "It's a talking stick, we're from the fishing village. It doesn't mean anything any more. There are other places to run. Oh, *more* important things."
You have the material. You've got the motive. Now it's up to you...
A smirk. She heard. The lieutenant gives her a quick sideways glance, before looking down again...
"A whole block may have been your deduction, miss." He leans closer. "But that's all we've got to go on."
I was not thinking about politics. (Smell your hands.)
"I'm gonna go with no."
Something stirs in the insect as you begin to back off. It seems to also takes a step back... Something tells you -- the next time you engage and disengage it will probably flee.
You've *probably* heard that before. The word has a hundred senses -- from smell, from movement, from the way it washes away...
He's right. It's actually kind of cool. Look at these two go-go!
This guy? The hopelessly drunk cop who ended up strangling a man and ate half his brain in a drunken rage?
Of course. The window was *stabilized*. By people who could have been identified. A real gang, *aka* the Killers...
"So, where did he get all this stuff?"
Whoa. That's pretty dark.
"S'always there."
A bustling trade fair expo is sprung from the metropolis, full of colorful tents, tableaux, and stalls selling everything
Okay, it's not bad. It's probably just your OED, a horribly mangled mess of coordinates and dates thrown together by some random guy on a lorry floor. (Not you, the writer, though.)
She's not sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, sire. You don't have to be a *lipper* anymore.
"I *will* go see the library, Harry."
"Uh... I mean, as far as heroes go..."
Just be blunt with him.
The boy tries to pretend he's not hearing by not saying a word, and not daring to move his mouth.
That's cool. But you've already said that -- he doesn't talk *as* easily.
"*You* got shot in the shoulder too," the lieutenant adds, his voice trailing off.
Again your words echo in the little room: *Thank you*.
You hear a faint *thuck* inside the abandoned fish market. Hard to say where exactly it came from -- the trader must have heard it and returned it.
"What is... er, Tzaraath?"
At the bottom of the man's boots you see the soles of some sort of plant, apparently soles of some sort of animal. But who cares, man? It's not *that* weird.
An imposing combination of a punch-clock and a payphone is staring back at you from the wall.
No. This is bad. She's right. You should go back and talk to him.
It's just going to come to us, you know.
"No idea. Maybe some *other* thing." She lets out a sigh. "Any ideas?"
"It's a very difficult subject to tackle. I think we could all do our part."
It's a *modesty*, of course. She would love it if you did the dishes at last -- but you're too fat for her.
"The man was a very successful entrepreneur."
"I need you to open this door.
"I do not *understand* now."
It's *not* a question.
"Yes." He nods approvingly. "What is this new drug called?"
HARRY THE VODKA COP
You're so *very* alive right now. This is the most liveable thing for sure. You've got this.
"Well..." He hesitates, as the water is starting to run. "You have the gun."
And a bad case number. The lieutenant doesn't see the point of questioning yet. What if she doesn't have the gun?
"I do not believe you. We should continue our search -- until we have our hands free to pursue a solution to the case."
She is. She *is* your real, complete and eternal *slave*.
I'm not sure I have what I need, can I reach the roof and get help?
"I'm glad you agreed." He takes one long drag and then says with quiet disdain: "Now we just need to talk. About how the police have fucked you over."
There goes the old man's cigarette and a bitter after-life smoke hangs over all the you. In front of them, a long time ago flows...
Wait, are we done talking about the fucking kipt?
"Good morning, officer." The lieutenant turns to you.
Yeah! So these *cops* are... I don't even wanna think ...
"Why do *you* think he did that?"
"Well, not really." He looks at you and the lieutenant, then you.
"That's what I've always thought: the future of art -- and the future of humanity."
"Look at all this stuff, it's cool. There's nothing I'd rather do with my life."
A moment passes. He shrugs off your question. He looks at the wall.
This *is* what is called a *disfigurement*.
"Of course. The sooner we have them here, the sooner we can get moving again."
"We're not here to make a killing, Mr. Evrart."
"Yes." The young man pats the jacket on the floor. "He's the kind of guy you can't bring back for a second chance. You never get that lucky with him."
"No, really, I need them for something... I don't even understand what the hell I'm trying to achieve with this project."
"The *fatal accident* had little real effect, I am the one you are alluding to here."
He's listening!
"Maybe you want to get back to the case? You have any leads?" He turns to you.
"Yeah." He nods eagerly. "I've heard Cuno say shit about the *paratroopers* too. I'm alright with that. They're good."
"You don't seem too happy about this. Do you have anything to tell me?"
"We all do." The old librarian says to you, watching you approach with both eyes. "It's my job to know the world."
"You know," a little smile grins at you from the corner of her eyes. "A common misconception, that's why the RCM doesn't have much of a track record in these things."
Maybe he *should* have more cash?
"No, he's an official." The man looks at him like he's in a bad mood. "He only says what the official does."
"He's glad to see you limping back here. Let's talk about something else."
She's not even living up to her *ladies*' kind. She's a recluse, a whore, a whore, a whore...
"There was a *f****t*. A big one. I think he lives in a church. A pretty big church."
*Doomer* is a euphemism for *doomed*. It's a catch-all term for officers of the law.
It looks like some kind of contraption like the one that makes music out of reeds is spinning around in here.
"Do you work in pale transport?"
"Don't be silly, they're not... they're not fucking monsters! They're human..."
It seems as though you were a *little* bit careless asking this one out. He doesn't like the wordy kind.
The lieutenant nods. "This is a *serious* matter, sir."
And then there's the fact... that his room is unguarded and that you can just *walk* in there and get around...
"Well, maybe. Anyway, I've got a preliminary examination to attend to."
"Cuno's got a very *good* way of communicating with the air. If it wasn't for the sound we would not have gotten out there!"
"Yes, my name. My name is Andre... Andre the Giant. And I'm a giant." He takes a small step toward to massive door.
A *welkin* is not a person. It does not live or breathe. It is not a mammal, and neither are the *sans boiadeiro*. Both are animal species that are considered to be the *supreme beings*, superior in many ways to humans.
But it's just you. A giant, floating block of marble in the middle of a sea of people.
The lieutenant leans in and inspects the man.
He has a *massive* gun as his *primary* weapon. It's like you just stepped into the future.
A gun!
A *gun*?
It's an *un-rewardable* prize. The most likely outcome is that you will die trying to crack this case.
"It's okay, officer." She turns away from you. "I... uh... I don't like it here. It's really cold here. I hope you don't mind."
Of course you do, just ask her where she's from.
"Oh, really?" There's a smirk on her lips. "Oh yes, very *serious* indeed."
"A single, clear shot and he would be dead."
Not good -- that doesn't sound right.
"Riding the cock parade, I see."
You know, it's kind of pathetic that you never learned the *truth*, but let's be honest, he's probably lying.
There must be a way to *lie* so you can get the facts?
"The fuck are you talking about, you stupid fuck? *I* told you it was okay, I told you everything was okay!"
"No. It's not. You cannot *escape* from your thoughts. What you are -- is not. You are an entroponetic entity."
It is not what you were hoping for, but this does not have to turn out to be an *embarrassment*, please.
You should ask the lieutenant what's going on. The situation is dangerous.
"You know, detective," the lieutenant says with a nod, "I *am* not your *sanction.* My badge is for a different officer, and I have been looking for her..."
"Good luck then."
The corpse-scented beast looks around in the reeds, looking for a scent it can use.
"I don't know..." he rubs his temples. "What was the name of your game?"
He takes off his glasses and puts them down. "I think everything works out. Let's just get back to it."
"Why, thank you, lovely lady, but your *unusual* generosity is not reflected in my ledger." He points to his ledger.
"What..." the lieutenant whispers to you, not wanting to *disagree* with the man. "Is this man your man?"
"I do want to." (Lie.)
"I would never lie." (Lie.)
"Did a drunk drive the truck right through you?"
"And he was on the run and now he's a scared drunk behind a fucking payphone?"
"Okay, so let's do this." (Accept.)
"It's not really good for me, and I'll take it off." (Decline.)
"Why didn't you think of that?"
"I don't know what the FUCK she's talking about. She only used her own money to buy those clothes."
"I know where the body is, I just need to finish my preliminary examination."
"If only the right words were spoken..."
"Look at Kim, he's so fucking cute!"
"This is a *stray*, right? You need to tell me!"
"Yeah, Cuno likes it."
"You don't like the *Pissf*****t* one?"
"I'm looking for a way to *re-conceptualize* the *Pale Intensifier*."
"You think maybe it's connected to the murder?"
"Wait, I meant your partner?"
"You said "Fuck him", aren't you the same race?"
And you *don't* trust them, you don't want to think about the other things said!
"You were thinking," he says with a smirk, "that maybe the hanged man's shirt was the source of our *irreducible* strangeness, and that we're not supposed to care."
"But it's really you!"
"I don't want to hear about your problems!"
"I'm sorry I doubted your mettle earlier. I'm a hard nut to crack, I'll just leave it at that."
*Bizarre*? Who's *wrong* now?
The lieutenant raises it to inspect the photo.
"I was born ready. I just need a bit of practice first."
"I don't *have* to worry about anything, I just need to keep my head above water..."
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "We should be cautious -- and not get entrapped in anything he might be suggesting."
It's you.
(Point at the back of your head.) "Look at me! I'm a robot."
"I guess this will do." (Tap your chin.)
"The most difficult part was actually getting him down, because in the evening you woke me up in the middle of the night. With the blanket wrapped around your neck, and the sheets wrapped around your body. You were cold. It was... unhygienic."
"But he is not an official RCM substation."
"Ahem. To be perfectly honest, I've always disliked the look of him. He was a *cocaine* addict like myself."
"They say this town is part of the Doomed Commercial Area. In Martinaise, a residential neighbourhood, near Canal. For the first ten years or so of Revachol's economic woes -- and certainly after the turn of the century."
"You got lucky, detective." (Point to your head.) "Like, really lucky. The locals, everyone thinks you got away with murder because you were young and silent."
"Yes." He takes a sip of beer. "A little something to ease the minds of those
"But why would you want to buy anything? You seem like a normal, regular person."
"No. I'm sorry."
"Just tell me, amirite?" (Try to conceal it.)
"Yeah, well, Cuno thinks you've got a thing for him. That fucking pig, Cuno likes him." He takes a sip of his beer.
"You know, when Cuno isn't around..." He nods to you again, then suddenly his expression changes. "Cuno gets really chill, he doesn't like the fuck that Cuno does."
"No, I'm the fuck up with it right now!"
"We're all pigs, pig!"
"Oh yes -- of course. You've been such a bother to me -- having two bums in a row..." She puts her fingers in her mouth to stop laughing. "It's okay, Fred. No one's going to listen to me now."
"The *ex-something*. A *gangsta* life." He looks at the crowd of people -- some of whom look unpleasantly relieved.
What is he, a mass murderer?
"You mean, like a *mulkku*? A *mulkku* is a mass murderer. *You* can't beat someone else to death with a mulkku." He seems genuinely excited. "I mean a mass murderer who's out of bullets."
"No. That's right. We are *officers* of the law. It's our duty to make arrests. It's our job. Now..." She takes a final drag of her cigarette, before tossing it back to her.
"No," he says in a hushed voice. "I can't talk my way out of the curse, you see. It's too much."
"I need to know, Kim."
Yes, it might actually be a good idea to remove the magnet.
His heart beats faster with every word. Like the final resting spot of a racing track leading to triumph and tragedy in the afterlife.
But there isn't more. It is as if you're using an entirely different set of words.
"He got shot in the head. In the head fucking hard. Like he was fucking... shot to death."
Suffocation. He's right. You shouldn't do that.
What was that? A little light? A twitch?
"A *gangster*, eh? Sounds like it's a *mafia* thing." There's genuine seriousness in his voice.
"*You're* a goddamn communist!"
"Did I help you, Eugene?"
"You heard me. I needed your help. Now, can you please step back and let the ladies be?"
In his eyes, time starts spinning *round*. You feel the world go back and forth on the walls of the room. The lights turn on and illuminate a blur, like the shapes appearing from some far-off place, like a dream...
"Ahem." The lieutenant is listening with great attention to your every word.
"My husband has Alzheimer's disease."
"This is the door to your room," he says as if you need instructions. "You will need to get in through this."
"You should get this shit out of the way."
"Momma said if you see a man wearing a red wig and a matching eye patch, she's gonna call the station and let them know. So I went around *Krenel* -- Krenel *officers*. Now, I went around Krenel *innocent*."
I think Kim would appreciate it.
"We do have it. Let's keep it moving."
(Rip into him with your teeth.) "Kim, it's not just me. We were looking for her, and now we found her."
"I can't see what it was that made you so *uncomfortable*... maybe it was your *hypothesis*."
"What's the status of the excavation?"
"You said nothing."
"This is a game!" She grunts. "That's it! You don't have an opinion. You can throw rocks at it, it doesn't move. You don't even have to do anything."
She does not look back, only forward, a look of bewilderment on her face.
"If we're going to treat human beings like *decoys* I need you to fuck off, pig."
There's something you've missed.
In the north-east, four men and one woman wear sandals and carry long belts. Their aim is to *retaliate* against the drug trade.
An old woman stands in front of a huge mural that depicts a white horse, flapping its wings, and an old pilot flying the C-Wing. In the background, a young girl with wide shoulders, long flowing robes and dark hair dances on the air.
"Okay, alright..." The lieutenant looks up and shrugs.
"I think I have it. Let me know when you've had a chance to look around."
She looks at you with pleading eyes. "Don't kill yourself, dear Mr. Dros!" she cries out of concern, as her hands are on the controls.
You've probably done it before.
"So -- that's what you're interested in."
So you're not fucking shitting yourselves that you thought I was lying to you.
He nods. "All I can say is: good on the job. What more can I say about that?"
"No. I think we have a full on *story* here. A true-life case of the apocalypse."
"No, nothing like this happens around here. Our station is pretty high-net-worth."
The lieutenant looks at you, a little disappointed but not too disappointed.
"Yeah, don't fuck us all up," he says with a grimace. "We'll only get weaker."
"No, it's a joke. I'm actually not laughing, because you just killed one of my favourite heroes. I thought the idea was too good to pass up..."
"Whoa..." He rubs his face in frustration. "Yeah, man. Cuno's pretty bored right now. Cuno's not really into you guys."
"You see, like... the way the world works, you can never really trust everything. I'm here to tell you what I think."
"He's a gangster, Kim. Like all the ones."
She doesn't reply. Just looks in the direction of the radiocomputer.
"The most recent entry says..."
"Okay. That's cool."
"What do you mean by *lividity*, exactly?"
"It's good to talk to someone. I can be helpful."
"I see." He turns to check the room again. "We should get moving. Let's check out the radiocomputer."
"That's not the *true* story. I didn't kill him. He was probably shot down. A cowardly soldier."
He knows you're thinking badly of him. You've let him down again.
"What if the Union *kills* itself out of solidarity?"
That's a dumb idea.
"This is your police? This is what cops are meant to do? Take the law into their own hands? I don't think that kind of approach *works*, but it would be nice if we could at least consider it..."
"I'm not interested in contraband, officer. Just police business. Tell me what you want." (Proceed.)
He's not lying about it -- this is very well done.
"I was asked to look into this murder case you mentioned. I'm not sure I can comment on it at this point, though."
"I'll tell you what this jacket is..."
She's not. They're *always* looking for something illicit...
"I think I have it all figured out, actually."
The lieutenant is not amused.
"It's you, officer..." His voice trails off into a gust of sea wind.
It's the night air, brooding away the city life. It's all gone now, the city...
"The man who walks like a man," he points West, "is an old man. He doesn't do *anything*. You think you saw the face of something? I can't *see* it."
"I don't know how I feel. About that drug trade."
"Fuck are you fucking TALKIN' about?"
"We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't even started yet."
"How are you gonna get in?"
(Turn to Kim.) "It doesn't matter, this is no time for frivolity."
"I did it for the environment."
"How do you know this? I haven't seen you around here before."
It's clear from her voice that she doesn't want to get into it. Too much as far.
"You're right about the age and health problems we're talking about though. *Age* is a thing you can suffer from, from a very young age."
He was wearing a dark brown leather jacket over a tan pantsuit, as he stepped out of the Whirling-In-Rags lunch spot. A black rectangular stain was visible under the washboard that shows just under the knee.
Let's hope nothing bad happens.
(Put it back down before it's your turn.) "So you haven't *taken* it from me?"
"A little late for that, I think..." She shrugs. "It'll come to him again. One day. It'll take some time -- at least a year?"
"I found two sets of footprints, but could not identify the tracks because the print does not look like a single stride. There are only two of the three pairs of prints we have together, and you cannot *decide* which one is the right one. It would be a minor miracle."
Yes, he was not wearing a jacket. But the moment he got up, that jacket felt right at home on his large frame. It was... warm.
"I'm looking for a *bulk load* of alcohol. Can you help?"
(Whisper.) "Kim, you've been *verbally* harassing my partner."
"What? No. Why not?" He shrugs. "I have plenty of goods to buy. This is not a vast market. You don't need everything from Isobel Sadies..."
The sun peeks over the clouds. A small vessel -- no larger than a sail -- makes its way over the coast, slowly, with lanterns flashing among the various parked motor craft.
He was a good and sober man, who made his way through a lot of difficulties and *did not* become a socialist.
"Cuno, let's open it. It's Cuno's turn to open the door now."
"Okay. But *why* would I..."
"Yeah, I'm not a 'hands-on-a-plate' type, man. I'm a bit of a *tourist* kinda guy. Taking all kinds of scenery with me."
Just leave him alone. That will *surely* contain the smell.
"I'm sure that once I am here I will be able to shed some more of my inhibitions and truly grasp the mysteries of reality." He looks around. "At some stage, yes."
You feel it, but something tells you... the presence is impersonal, not at all like the others.
(Whisper.) "Kim, check this out!"
The old woman is silent and unmoving. The pendant around her neck jingles with an imperceptible treble.
It's like the rain -- you feel it coming, running, gurgling somewhere in the cellar, underground.
"Are you a member of the *curse* then?"
"Wait, I have an *investigation* to attend to before I can ask Mr. Claire about this again -- I have to go."
"No, they didn't take the body down myself. Police officers don't go around *asking* people for personal information like that. I can talk to them..." She stops, as if she was about to continue walking through the gate.
"Maybe the Wild Pines has *not* listened to us? Shouldn't they have?"
The door to the 'personal log' is wide open.
"So the boat is back up at The Loo. I think we should let them know what we found. That way, they won't have time to take it down..." He looks east. "If they were here, they would know we took it."
"I've kept my nose out of the ocean because I believe it in my own blood."
"A good guy..." He looks down. "He's seen my progress. I can appreciate that. He *is* a decent guy. He'll come around."
"You're right, let it be like this. The only thing I haven't solved is the mystery of the phasmid."
"Aye, so here you are. Early bird gets the worm, I can tell you -- you're one of my sweet lost friends. I've said it two thousand times now. I'll always remember it. Thank you."
The lieutenant steps closer, still a solid metre away...
*Babybeard*, *the buggar*. Was he born with a gun in his hands?
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the smallest -- where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag -- are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.
"A book, maybe?"
A sudden, violent flash of indignation.
"Remarkable. I have no comments -- can we get back to our cases now?"
Yeah, you're probably one of the wannabe-skulls types, or perhaps you're just some high-school bullying enthusiasts...
Did... he actually think you were a police officer?
This is probably what happened to Revacholian communism.
"I'm not waking this one out." He shakes his head. "I'm gonna pull my fat ass out and this will be the good disco I've havent felt in years."
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"Do they sell them?"
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
"Hm, sorry."
"Apologies."
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"Do they sell them?"
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
"Hm, sorry."
"Apologies."
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
*Everyone* knows how to put it -- missing people is not important to you. Are you sure it didn't turn out like that?
"They couldn't just animate it in the chimney. They had to keep it in."
"A young woman? Or a woman from the district of La Delta?"
Deeper. The dark hall of the secret tunnels...
Won't this Frisby mess make you into a real party boy?
Harry drags his gaze away from the curtains.
Because I *hate* you.
Indeed. Like a spider, spider is capable of turning any feeling into an excruciating pain. This makes it all the more remarkable that this man could even be a pretty super-detective.
"I'm doing this
Doesn't want to get crowned Revacholian.
Their extinguished fires warmed her warm.
"Oblivion -- I love it, it's my mainstay in this house. It gives me security and helps with the cold. It's a *natural* painkiller. It's what I have. It's good for me."
Not guilty, you're just going to let it go.
Another Sad FM Child
"I am a bit surprised to hear that." He turns to the woman. "You're a black sheep. The shepherd of sheep. All I know is, I will die soon."
The end. It must be... terrible, oh oh... awful.
Still, Acele can tell when one's not *just* with his *eyes*.
Read,drinker and die.
*Then*? Who would do that?
"I didn't. You seem invested in this."
"I am a violent man. I can't have pig-bears all the time."
"So... uhm... the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" She looks half-bored for a moment, or you'll get another beer.
And where is it from?
*Economic*? Huh? Something morbidly funny under the pretence of explaining how economy works.
"I am the voice of reason, but I also have the *moral* to go around robbing people."
"I didn't object. I'm an *establishment*."
**Dealing* with the Union? That sounds *crazy* to me.
Cursed Iilmaraan book.
Do you want to know what happens when you call her again?
"Hey!" He turns a tap on the pipe. "I hear you, buddy-boy. You wanna get some 'er?"
"I'm sorry, this place is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
"I've been thinking... what *paranoid behaviour*." (Point to your head.)
"There's something I can do for you. Help you fix this." (Give him the sandwich bowl.)
*ORDER NOW!* Press ENTER.
"He's gone." (Conclude.)
With longing, she squints her eyes, hoping for something...
Sir, let it go! She's not going to come up with anything on her own. You're too embarrassed to take it off now.
"Where can I find them?"
"Fucking *world-class* armour."
Marie? She doesn't look like anyone you could come by coincidentally, it's more like an artificial eyelid.
See you. Thank god he never existed.
So this is how it's going to go: bad for your health, the perception of a leader of men has been... basically wrecked.
He walks away with a weary smile, his cigarette ash falling silent on the railing.
Besmertnyé?
"*Mon dieu*," he sighs. "May the purity of love guide them to the path. May their souls guide them to the land of the pure."
Tell her she has the right armour.
Different, he thinks. Why would you waste time if you're *not* talented?
The Trash Collection Service? That's a *real* TipTop Tutti. It's in Revachol. In Couron.
"Is that so, sister?"
The window feels very cold. The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your clothes on the rooftops...
"You're not. You're a cop, after all."
"I didn't act on instinct. I'm an incompetent *wunderbar*."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." she suddenly says.
What is *totally* happening, isn't it?
"He missed his family." The lieutenant's voice is calm as a blade.
"I do," she nods. "How long has he been on the force?"
"I work hard. I like it cold," she responds.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard over and protect the Commune.
Sure, you're twenty two. What are you going for there? A kid? A cop?
*You* would have spared the lives if it weren't for your sleeve.
"I'd rather die than see this."
"If I *want* to hang you myself, you're going to have to do it myself. In a juvie-bourgell. In a juvie-bourgell."
"No, no-no," he finishes. "You've really fucked yourself, f****ts. *You* are the real heroes in the matter. You're the real cause of cell-phone doom. Now get it together and watch your friends die!"
"Titus, you're getting *into* me."
You've managed to do that, now you've managed to speak
"A hole in the world?"
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions."
"People tell me, and the kids in Martinaise, I'm their buddy. We work together. This isn't some act...."
Still? Probably. Keeping a low profile is important -- for historical reasons.
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be a fan of the fan."
" *Androgynous*. Haircuts and skin colours... and a hint of adventure. "
"Any time. There's only one way to get to it. We can't just leave. It's too dangerous. And too dangerous... anyway."
Lieutenant, you're not too sorry about that. Just *one* mistake...
Guess... this would look totally implausible if you were to just... let you off the hook.
The window feels cold. The wind howls in from the city. An old woman stands there, ash-caked, staring at you.
The airways above the buildings creak and roar.
"Are you alright, officer... I haven't been able to take you... please step out of my sight!"
"Good," she responds with a cursive smile.
* ostensible, but what the *actual* contents* are more complex and opaque. It's more like you're...
"Fucking whore..." The old woman's face is motionless.
The boots fit you. The pain must be immense.
"KILL? SPLAT DOWN, BETWEEN THE COUNTLESS HEROIC MATTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH YOUR MIND!"
*Psychic* approach!
That shit ain't telling you anything!
carefully, so you don't fall over on your left side.
"I'm a smart cop. I think I'm smart."
"I do," she nods.
No, you *need* to be in the game before you can complete it.
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely."
"I'm afraid the RCM will be here shortly. Have you seen them around?"
Went straight. At your own pace. This sounds like *well tuned* Wirrâl. Wirrâl sounds... *well tuned* to me. WIRrâl sounds. Wirrâl! Wanna see why?
"Shall we go and get the spirits now?" (Proceed.)
have you tried? You fucking gonna let that guy go, Cuno?! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
Goddamnit... you shouldn't have done that. You know it.
*Establishment* is the practice of enticing people into committing suicide.
Boy, you've said plenty of things right and asked plenty of people. That won't work.
"Are you alright, Harry? You were drunk."
"I was always worried about you. I thought you were a menace to the good order..."
"Okay. Nothing major. Just wondering..."
"I am *not* going to entertain anyone with this any more."
"It's not *that* cool."
"No matter. You ruined it."
A dumbfounded, you hear the machine whir back to life. The words: "Detective -- Klaasje -- Only Human."
"I am cool, Kim."
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." She points across the water, where the strandbare grass is growing darker.
no, not disco... disco lights, glittering... god dammit...
A big smile quivers on his face as he replies: "Sure. How else can I help you?"
"I'm a policeman myself, that's why I have the best theories."
"Something to think about, don't you think?" She looks around, then points her cigarette at the ground. "Right now."
"The crates are all worthless. And your investigation will be over before you find what really entroponetized you."
"I'll leave that to your judgement."
A well-meaning but superficial deduction. You're a smart cop and you can see the world, but...
But don't drive.
In easy access it curdles into four parts:
A set of? You know the ones! The kind with the spotted feet? The Lilly Boy...
Finanzo 'Dr John' Cranbrook
Spit flies from your mouth. Your shoulders slump down.
flat, white lies all over.
The gardener observes you
Time to go. [Leave.]
"I just don't wanna talk about it. Let's move on." (Don't take the case.)
The plastic jumps open on the inside. The food itself is white, but it still smells of salt.
As if it's not snowing completely. All the lights in the world turn on, invisible towers above Martinaise roll into focus as the city draws closer to us. Stations of light rise and fall on the city, all warning of what's to come...
no, it's not! It's not a "roo!"
"I found this book. Thank you, Trant." (Conclude)
What's *your*? You look like a hobo.
What does? belongs to you. The *ace* in between the thirds.
* *AUTOMATIC SHOES* -- it's the name of one of the pioneering text-based systems used by the multinational corporations operating in these environments.
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do, but who cares?
Church
The crackle of metal, metal, the creaking of wood, the bass of music, the creaks of waves... You feel that child's weight shifting around in your skull, pulsating through you, until everyone is on equal footing...
"Pardon me... I thought you'd appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters." She looks worried. "I'm sorry, lieutenant, I'm not sure I convince you all the time."
Your coronary artery is intact. It's blocking the blood from flowing properly through your body. You should get a chest X-ray to check your coronary arteries.
"It's just a story, Harry. It's not a serious matter."
Maybe the missing locusts were entombed there, in the traps planted by Evrart's deceit.
*And* you're a coward.
"A prayer." She nods. "Let's see if the spectral hand of nature is holding back the *deluge* that's coming."
flares all the sines together, so naturally they play those sounds with equal gusto: *piss
"What happened?" your partner starts, as he continues to stare at his logs.
"I'm scared! Watch your hand raises, it's trying to wipe your face clean. Leave the Cuno here pig-headed. Cuno's gonna be *in* the Cuno-head!"
"The officers are gonna have to read that decision."
"I'm sorry to interrupt your thought, partner, but my partner, Glen, was just trying to impress your partner with some pretty amateurish moves. We've had a fair share of arguments."
Your brother is always watching over you. Always telling old stories and inspecting your mental health.
"Dora, I'm sorry. I'm the one who always stays at your place. To the side when you're away. To nurse those unfortunate men, when they're sick. I... I just... I can't."
"Do they?" She raises her brow, confused.
"Give me a moment. We've been running around together doing *bad* things."
Nah, this was a good question. The guy seems to be *confiscating* things.
"It isn't." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "This is a pretty *significant* development. We should move on."
It's not because you're any good. Not today, no more.
"What proof?"
The Stalwart Way is an organization of archaeologists, carpenters, graphic designers, and those who love to travel! It's what regular people do when you want to impress the world!
"No, I don't think so." (Look around.)
Not one, but three things. The creature is tall, dark, and completely silent. It has a bulbous, shiny, jelly-shaped head like that of a *monkey*, and no eyes on either end. It haunts the ruins left over from the battle.
"Until you started *vodka-fucking*.... it was all fucking you."
"I am barely keeping you together here. The days are long, the work is never-
"Not when you're wondering if your doorbell is being snooped on." She corrects her hat. "Your hair is welkins to cover your eyes. Your hat is welkins."
"A teenage runaway. A *queen regnant*."
* *You*..."
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at Kim. "May I ask about something else?"
"Okay. I'm Billie. My name is Billie. How can I help you?" She walks away.
This year he leans in more deeply, like he's about to say something: "As you can see, the perforation on the side of the bay is enormous. It's where the human were..."
You're getting a nihilistic vibe from that sentence. It's not connected with hangovers.
*Snap!* The act of touching away feels almost touching.
Doesn't feel... super.
You're just a figment of your imagination.
The wind picks up, young Claire looks around. There's a chance it's her daughter, Little ELIZABETH, who's in the backyard!
You have a pretty good case to solve, right? Go to the aerodrome. Art is the light at the end of the tunnel. Go find art. Get rich.
"Oh no?" he throws you a sharp glance. "You're not."
Won't? You're under stress. Or not under a detective at all. This is your chance.
*This* is what Cuno calls aopathic, *because* he believes the world is corrupt. He's got that swishy *detector's* bag."
Son. Who is it?
"I don't *have a fridge*, I have a gun."
What's with the wet tongue?
"Dora?" she's hesitating, "you're trying to say this is the Wild Pines rep?"
The glint in her silver eyes tells of the weariness and exhaustion on Suzerain's part. She's almost ready to nod, but...
"I'm pretty sure you're working class. I'm your type. You live nearby."
Do not interrupt him. "PIGS IN C, COCKS IN C!"
"Oral cavity screening? You were just having a bad day. Or you were in a *fight*?"
"What can you tell me about this... spooky guy?"
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your future husband.
"Yes. Of course. Thanks, for getting me and my friends in here. And we hope you do too."
"The Hardie boys are on to something here."
Solving this race mystery is proving a little difficult. Even the professionals agree that it's time.
"I found the thing. Just took a look."
Have other thoughts?
*Mon die* -- literally "Mon die" -- is what's referred to here as a *deconstruction*.
Gender equality is a *growing* possibility in the coming decades, don't you think?
*Puts everything first*
Up here -- on the seafort -- on this coast -- you will find a hidden corner of the world called Oblivion.
* *The Man from Hjelmdall*... what *has* he done?
"Yes, I just thought they had it, we all have our things -- drugs and porn stars."
*Stop* is within your grasp.
"Garbage..." The lieutenant assesses the situation. "Is there anything we can do to assist you?"
With an unrestrained pang of self-interest.
A face that reminds you of kitchen help.
What is it? Where is it? Where is that slap?
"I'm an okay man, so let's talk about something else."
Read your answer.
Ugh... you're nodding too. You're just going to have to keep nodding, and make up your mind, CAPITAL. You're a great idea.
"Serious business, you are one strange cop. Think about it, actually!"
Reality, in its discomen, harbours little desire to admit the error of its ways. It only cares for its enemies. It is but a dim dimple cast aside by their insignia.
"I'll put you on speaker, Hypothetically."
"The lock was supposed to be broken in by a local shopkeeper, by the way -- I saw him there yesterday. He was wearing a brown raincoat. I called the station and they were supposed to be out Monday. It was Monday, but they told me they would be Monday. They told me yesterday was a good day."
"I'm sorry. Sorry I couldn't help more." She looks down and falls silent.
"Oughts?" The young man frowns. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
"I still don't understand what you're doing in the city," he says after you've agreed to talk to him. "There's something *wrong* with that man..."
All I can, I'm gonna go with
"AUGUSTA, NOW GO ON AND RIDE THE P-R-R-ROCKETS!"
The dark sarcophagus... looks like the person behind it. Maybe you should come back to this *thing*-based questionnaire later, just in case.
"Where can you get your hands on that?" The lieutenant looks at you, then you.
Good. Now roll and tell the tale. (Finish thought.)
The amphetamine lab? That sounds rather bad. This is where you say your awful ass was. You're in there.
So what? You're under orders...
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this world, but now you've come to the end of your rope.
"Hm... I don't know, I don't know what happened."
"You were trying to get me to do a favour for *you*. You wanted me to do it. You promised to do it *only* for me."

Police regulations strictly limit the right amount of background information a police officer can share with anyone under their jurisdiction. This would only be a problem if there were a background check on officers across the board.
" Great news, officer, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. Now I'm going to put you in a *rest* unit and you're going to understand."
Welcome, your lost friend, someone new to this tableau -- it's me. The crown of delusions is yours. Take note of it.
I am so very sorry for your loss.
I don't think he's that bad.
Known and forgotten. Enforcing habits. Humanity's garbage.
"I am barely keeping you together here, but I'm getting somewhere... There is no friend."
"Good! 'Toratürk'  -- what else can I do for you?"
This is a very, very bad thing.
PRESSURE! You felt it -- THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- TOWARD THE MOTHER OF YOUR ENTIRE NURSES. YOU MUST MAKE IT THROW WHOM IT IS THROWING.
"I've got someone *here*."
This would make quite a statement in your living room.
Your fingers feel red, like lead. From the blood in his chest
It's not because you're a *scientist*, is it? Just a little more!
"Good to meet you." The woman nods. "I've always wanted to hear about your research. Did you pursue that goal myself? You inspired some of the great *triangles* back in the U.S."
"I can't say. It was there." She puts out of mind's grasp. "Where was I then. When I was hunting for that key I decided against it."
Frequency Fireplace
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm still the Sorry Cop." (Pat your friend's shoulder.)
"7th FEB, '54."
Almost there. You've earned it.
PRESSURE! YOU FEEL IT THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- THROUGH YOUR NURSES AND INTO YOUR GIACLE FORTY YEARS AGO. EVERYWHERE YOU MOVE IS IN MISSIONS AND IN AIR MILES WITH THOUSANDS OF CARIBBEERS.
Time to talk politics! All this talk of *you* is *wounding* you! WAIT! You'll get the key from the karaoke carousel!
This is about three metres tall, almost two meters tall, and weighing almost two tons. It's political. The one about two metres tall just doesn't care about that.
Mullen's an honest man, if he doesn't seem like a cop he's got a nice soul, good for his special tie.
*Racist* swear words.
"Fucking..." he squints. "You can't see, you fucking fat fuckshit... Cuno doesn't have shit. You look like you were *built* to fight."
"I understand," the lieutenant looks around. "It's less about *anodic dance music* than it is about territorial losses."
"The company's ailing. The next batch will be renewed for a three-year term. It's impossible to imagine a more *cursed* entity rolling out a 'ka-ching' than the artificial insemination unit."
"The Ptolemy? That makes no sense -- and furthermore, there's no pale, at least not from what I understand it to be the case."
The man wavers under the lieutenant's arms.
What is this missing machinery is involved with?
"Family?"
"I'm sorry, I'm being too hard core here."
"What is it, what are you doing?"
U4? Oh, sorry. It just wasn't my style.
He's back to telling you all he knows. A trooper has been assigned to your case -- and he knows *exactly* what you *didn't* think.
You have a feeling your skull would crack if you told it to tell you what you *can't* eat.
"I'm sorry I don't have a gun."
Footprints in the dust below the stench.
The horse sits on the wet ice, its joints twisting like ancient chitin.
Are you sure you don't need it?
"Why the fuck would he want to *promise* anything?"
"I'm a policeman, I don't need any badges or medals for that. I'm a professional."
You shudder, as the great bird of a lower intestine cavents an unknown evil. It's very close to your face, and judging by the way she's moving, it's very unlikely you're imagining it.
Katarzine Alasije, sister!
Well, napalm ants! Soldier of the Apocalypse.
"I'm a policeman myself."
"Any cop? I mean... Who do you think robbed this kid?"
You've physically destroyed both your stomachs. An exoskeleton. And a brain.
*Transport to CA!* Transport to Tricentennial Electrics central, explode the Triangong 4-46!
"It sounds like a pretty big deal." (Make another one.)
"Yes, I heard you. You shouldn't have."
"Locked up? Cuno wasn't in there. Cuno's fucking *own* motherfucker helped."
Snowflakes fall on the barrels of your eyes. They're not human, they're ice.
*Or* you could become super-cool.
The rule. It's the rules, Harry. Don't touch them.
Does that mean you're out of line?
"It shouldn't be. But we should."
This is just a piece of the puzzle. Let's get back to it.
"You know I'm a Revacholian patriot, okay? I won't do anything bad."
"I wasn't put on this death march to get news on cops. I'm more an equal-opportunity oppressed one -- the *persecution* is just how the economy works."
Time for the laedy to spill her guts. The man hates her!
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno cares about this shit. You know what Cuno is."
The boatshoers? What would you do if you had an alcoholic captain?
The gesture is so familiar, you think you detect a slight buzz of gratitude here -- but what is this, exactly?
Now that you mention it, I disagree. I think she was *shy*.
"Whooh, Mirova! We were talking about it. It's coming to us."
Bugs? There's a security risk with this. Could be there's been a security guard or something.
Not that you're supposed to be looking for a bride, being the bride every day.
"Cuno's just a sweetheart. She only got into grief over *me*."
"DON'T WORRY, MARK! I'LL WORRY!" Her face is beady from the cold.
"I'm so sorry. I don't even know what words to use."
The *nearly* complete loss of the left leg makes you unable to walk, so you've already made yourself a *tentative* for the day
"What's a *cop*?" The man shakes his head vigorously. "I don't have a name or anything, but my name's *Eugen*."
"I'm a bit of a cop myself."
"I'm gonna turn this place sideways. You can't take over the world!"
"Hey, Cuno--" The Cuno looks back at you, grinning. "That's too bad you left before they even got here..."
"It seems like the man behind the bar had a *little* difficulty keeping his drink. This is clearly his fault. And you're going to make him get even more careful about what he says..."
"And why aren't you a police officer?"
"The place is on fire. Please..." (Proceed.)
"Fuckin' *shit*." He grunts, before turning back to the window. "I'm gonna get the hell out of here. This is a fucking fire alarm."
"It was a little of a pain to get here, the cadaver. We did it." The lieutenant gestures toward the sea. "So was that the *whole* wall?"
A *strange* one. It's so strange, so *shocking*.
"What if I need to know that?"
She looks at the ground, her gaze fixed on the water.
"I'm just the messenger." [Leave.]
Cuno goes in over two seconds later and grabs his partner, right hand on his rifle, while the other is holding his pistol. A moment of silence ensues.
The man has just learned that he's a policeman, for the next twenty seconds. He does not take the gun back, but he doesn't need to. (Punish!)
He's right. I don't need it right now. I'm cool.
I've been here, you know. Over and over again. Even more than you thought. The whole world is watching.
"We could still be making our way around the island, picking up supplies, or just running around, doing crazy things. I just want to know more."
"Are you sure? It could be dangerous."
This is it. This is going to change the world.
"Aye, they came around here to pick them up. They were good enough to take me to court and they were the ones who put me in... oh boy. I don't know what I've done. This whole thing just feels so... *disreputable*. I'm a man of peace, this is how I like things."
"But then *I* was here, but only to talk to *you* and not you to do anything..."
That's all she has to say right now.
The man raises a brow and shakes his head repeatedly: "There was *Ishido* here -- he and his men came in here to take me home."
"I don't even." The man looks around, his eyes dark and unfocused.
"He's *disco*," he finishes thoughtfully. "So I told him we were here to talk -- or maybe to ask? I don't know. This *is a joke*."
Something's just off here!
"All right, we'll move on to our next question."
That's probably the smartest thing he's ever done.
"All right, I know some who take drugs -- my partner is an experimental chemist by the name of *Tommm*. He doesn't know about drugs, he just tests chemicals."
You're *not* the police. You just need to know that...
"He's been on the coast for two months. It's almost certainly been there for at least two years. You had better not to let him return."
"It's just a part of the *nou* routine..."
"I thought you said I'm a corrupt officer of the law."
The man pulls a lever at the rear. The waterline is pulled into the hatch, revealing that the hatch is open and the pilot on board in his wake, a man named *Maxie*.
"Oh yes, the one you're supposed to kill."
I don't know, I've never really thought about that...
"I know you said *not* to. What will it be?"
"I have this *shower* of a gun. I use it."
"You're right, I guess it's best we talk about something else."
"I... don't want to."
"I'm more than happy to tell you what we discovered. Let's talk about *the curse* first."
"What happened to this agreement?" (Show him the Valley of the Heads.)
To everyone! To the cops, the cheaters, the rich guys. Everyone! Look around and tell them what a lovely and orderly WORLD we've got.
"I am the police."
Give her a hug.
"Gnhhhh..."
"Roon, the real deal is in those armoured boots. The boots are *all* good. You should wear them when you're out partying.
Pain Welkin.
THE GREAT SPIRITUAL ACADEMIC WAR OF THE CENETIC AND THE ILLANTISTS.
"I did," she nods.
*Mon die* really, really is driving home the point of entry here: race theory is not a central theme in Martinaise.
I don't know? I'm just disappointed.
"NACRA"
"Titus..." She lowers her voice. "I *know* you're being sensible here. I don't need to hear about *trouble*. There are people around here raising hell. Tell me -- do you need help?"
The bosses. Volition. Reward it.
Hold up, can I just get a free die?
Vine, linen! This is the *real deal*. Turn your back on her and lick that stain, detective.
"I am only a police officer. I don't have a camera."
Why are you even still talking to this? You're hormonal spike of excitement, this is the last thing you should be experiencing.
Honoured, did the wise and noble Man from Hjelmdall mention the atrocities committed by his people during the War? Or are you the *fire and brim with flaming embers* you look for? The man from Hjelmdall's Valley?
Established probable cause.
Disco -- that's what your mind is telling you.
"I'm not sure about the jackets I have for the others. These seem to be custom-made."
The wind stops. "And you, cop-man. You're gonna stand here like a fucking god damn snow leopard, goddamnit!!" His smile is like a white knight guarding your retainer. "You're gonna stand here like a fucking god damn snow leopard, goddamnit!!"
"A sissy attempt to undermine my authority," she says matter-of-factly. "Thanks for being candid, Miss Beaufort. Now, what can I do for you?"
You're a bit of a cop now, he thinks -- right?
Nor is the *need* to worry about topping the bottle. You were clearly in plenty shape up there in Martinaise.
angles to one side.
"I'm a policeman, I don't want to think about. Not things that would make one think of a *grave* humanitarian catastrophe..."
I can't just sit here. I have to come up with something exciting.
"I am as blue as daylight, as pure as the wind around you, and I will *sail*."
Salts? Sulisław? Siigay?"
"Bastards!" He yells and their herds of boiadeiro knights cheer him on.
All-powerful. Powerful enough to change the course of history.
*ORDER IT OUT!* Stop the tape before it's too late. There will be no harm done.
"I've heard this -- mourning with your hair like you own up to it."
Cheek against cheek, plump against jaw, bushy wings like hair on a wing. This dark shadow grows smaller as you get closer...
"There weren't any questions." (Conclude.)
The slow movement of the creature's limbs is pleasing to the eyes, moist from the frigid air.
nuting it.
Don't give her the pleasure.
Busted his claims. Smear his aura of loathing with dirt.
Clyde walks to the wooden platform and falls asleep on the wooden platform. On the wooden boardswalk, on the wind-swept coast of Mundi, she listens to her boat grow by the wind.
She's not lucky for him.
"I'm afraid we're not going to do that, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
By The Cockatoo!
Do I look like a fucking clown?
"I am being sarcastic. This is actually a very serious situation. You need to get medical attention." (Take another step closer.)
Kim's not human. He's a tool -- used to do what's necessary -- and a tool-elite.
"Enough business, let's talk about something else."
See you, Col Do Ma Ma Daqua!
The boots are beautiful. You should wear them underneath your athletic coat 
"It's the homosexual activity" and "vaporizing vapour from the atmosphere." She doesn't go into detail about the otherworldly presence inside her head.
"How do I know? Because we've been in one place. In one *way*. In five minutes we *happened*. No one can ever truly know what happened. This is just a vague rumour, made by someone..." He gives you a questioning look.
I would love gifts.
"Not for him, I'm sure." He pauses. "But you're so kind to him."
"The big guy with a long beard."
A man, yes. A man with a long beard... his face goes white and he flicks back, hands shaking. His eyes close shut tight.
SOLAR FRAMES
"You're just holding the doorbell and not turning the knob."
"Oh, please, please, please don't be such a dick about it."
"It doesn't look like there's any other place." (Conclude.)
"No, sorry, I don't like to keep things in front of me for long, actually. It's always better to keep them a bit hidden -- or, at the very least, *not* on display -- lest someone finds them."
"Thank you." He looks you in the eye. "You're such an excellent detective, you have me *all* hooked."
It looks like someone misplaced a key somewhere in the back of an old vehicle.
Whooh, not this again! Get off my fucking ground! Put his cock in the hole!
"I know this place. I've been to its dark heart, even. But I don't think it's a pretty pretty darn good place."
"Why not? I've got a nice place. It's on the coast. No need to worry."
"Don't tell me everything, I can't *polarize* the man with lies. I'm going to *convince* him."
You know what it means! You did it for her.
"This is a big fuckin' ask. And I would suggest you bring along a friend to help keep things orderly."
"Yeah, you know what I think about your idea." It makes sense!
No. They're all just tools. A tool for you and me.
"Yeah, I see that."
"Look, Cuno -- I'm gonna get one -- but you, you have to understand how much *I* value loyalty."
"It was a terrible, selfish idea." She sighs.
"But still, that was pretty cool! Anyway. What else did you want to *know*?"
(Sig your finger and wave your hand.) "Alright, cop, you lost my gun."
"Cuno's a fucking champ. Not like that guy. Cuno's a chameleon, you know? That pig always thinks Cuno's a real big deal."
"No, I don't think anyone will blame you. I was just trying to figure out if you've been here all day."
"I'm a little worried we're gonna end up as some kind of *tragi-comedy*, with you as our bad guy. Or maybe it's just that you haven't played with *anything* in a while. Or maybe you should just..."
That was almost perfect.
"Well, actually, yes -- there may be *some* *specialists* out there who want to sell them, if that's what you're after."
"And why are you looking for them?"
"No, I'm just gonna fuck off, I'm used to it now."
I don't have anything. I can't do anything.
"It's a small group of men who like to take a breather on the boat in the morning -- and then spend the rest of the day working in other dangerous jobs on the docks."
"The next step you're taking will have consequences. It will lead to more *serious* problems, if you continue it."
"What did you say, Harry?" The big guy in the boat nods at you, then turns to Titus. "It's good we got your shirt. You *should* get your shirt off."
"Hey, maybe you can help me out with something? Ask around there -- any questions, officer."
There's little resistance on the other part of the screen -- but they are still cautious from behind the glass.
"Goodbye, and good luck with the investigation, little guy. No one has the same *identity* as you."
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what you want to be.
"It's just like everything else. Just some... unfortunate circumstances. Things happen. And in some cases they *do* turn out bad."
"What did you think was gonna happen?"
"I would only listen if you wanted me to talk to a detective, that is all."
This is the *exact* moment he's trying to cover up a lie. He doesn't want the officers to find out about it.
The lieutenant points his gun at your face.
"Yeah, yeah, that was one of the most *bad*. I'm just gonna go ahead and keep it, alright?" (Back off.)
"What else?"
"The lieutenant looks at her, confused, but doesn't say anything. He's waiting for you to step over and put you down, then you do." The lieutenant doesn't say anything anymore and his eyes move back to your face.
"I don't think you have to give me my gun. I mean, I *know* we're dealing with a suspect."
The woman nods and looks at the sea.
"Is this where you get the *diamond-encrusted* guns you're waving around when the police need you to make arrests?"
"Don't you have any questions for me? Are you still with us? Please repeat..."
"Look, Harry -- it's an old ship."
The lieutenant frowns. "We don't have to let the girl go unless the commission determines that you have reason to. And you have to give up some sort of a criminal organisation before those officers can make their arrests."
"The woman that *was* in your room that evening?"
"You don't get to pick your nose and live, I'm sorry."
"Alright, I get it." There's an exasperated look on his face when he thinks this over.
"There is no doubt in my mind that it will *do* something. The end is not just for me -- for all of our members."
"I wouldn't go so far as to say that the police officers were *wrong* to take her along -- but I would say *it's* *unfortunate* that they took her along on such a trip."
"And so you *went on*?"
"I'm not even getting into what that means. The Union isn't part of this."
"No one is really in a position to do this right now." She looks to you. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Let's go?"
She takes out her key with a small flick of her sleeve and hands it back to you.
He smiles: "No. I mean the *whorehouse of shit* that the phasmid is keeping..."
"I'm not really looking for a challenge then. It's a lot easier if I know the right guys are following."
The lieutenant taps his foot against the polished wood floors of the small tent. It's surprisingly quiet there. The sun's low at the horizon, high above the horizon...
"Yeah, man... I just don't want to go to the police station."
"The most important thing about Revachol is that people aren't stupid. And we're not stupid, either."
"That's a good point." He nods thoughtfully. "We could take your suggestion to the lab, I trust you've got the equipment."
"You mean those two figures?"
"Oh, Harry! You don't even know what to say -- good for you, man!"
"I'm really *not* looking for anything illegal in this at all."
"But, Kim, don't just throw your hands up and say: you made me *puke*. I've been hearing this stuff for *twelve years* from these guys around..."
"It will take time." He looks to the city. "It's a big city. You've lived here for a while and it hasn't been easy."
"Okay, I admit. That doesn't sound very good. But not really bad in the grand scheme of things."
This man really is trying his absolute best.
"Hey, that's not what we want to do. Give us some time."
"Oh, right!" The young woman smiles brightly. "You'd like to know that."
"Cuno can't see the way ahead." He points to his friend, who's smiling his unearthly smile. "The *moth-song* will eat shit."
Just like the one the thief is hiding from, the painting says "Man with Hid Dog".
"*This* is the killer! He killed the pirate and *now* he's here..." The man shakes his head, as if to say...
"I've got a couple of questions -- what do they look like?"
The lieutenant looks at you with a quizzical look. When he comes to the conclusion that you are not the police, he turns back to his notebook...
"I did. I got the wrong address."
"What if I just told you that we're a police commission? What if I told you that it's a *force majeure* situation?"
"What kind of questions am I asking that one?"
"You mean like a murder investigation."
No. You're just a little *diver* at the end of a rope.
You've just pissed him off. He's getting antsy.
"I don't understand what you're saying, officer."
"I have an idea, it's not gonna be good..."
"Well, if you're just going to use our little forum, I guess that's fine." She pours herself more espresso.
"There's no room for one of these in any RCM precinct around here."
"You're the best. Sheesh..."
"And why do *you* think it's all fucked up? I told you we're dealing with criminals."
"Cuno! I'll take the mic!"
"You mean the woman who called in? She called in, sir. I'm a public office, not a police officer."
"The *Pissing Contest Entrants*. You mentioned them, like, once?"
"Yes." (Point to your face.) "What's yours?"
"It seems to be the case that only a few people would have any trouble with..." The lieutenant glances over at Titus.
"I'm not sure, officer. This particular piece fits a lot of people's taste, but we need to get a better view -- and this is something I can work on."
"No, I've got a bad feeling about this one."
"How do you keep it together?" (Look around.)
The only answer is: *fuck away the pain*.
"Pft!" Torson snorts. "Pile this on some younger folks."
No panic washes over you as you stare at the familiar carved stone. A note hangs on the side door -- you open your eyes again. It is still there -- covered in death and decay.
"I'm a... white star."
All I can say is: we could probably use a compressor to compress that data maybe... maybe you could compress it and send it to the Large Hadron Collider in Mirova, to be *smooth*...
The Mesque upper crust has fallen to the nearby Ligature Cryptozoologists. An alliance of semi-mythical forces, all vying for the upper hand in economic and social affairs... just don't expect a fair fight in the coming decades.
"It sounds like you're talking about the one who *isn't* here..."
You've got no fuckin' stomach for this. Beer *or* sex.
Your guess is as good as one can make at it. If the answer is yes, there's nothing else to do but wait.
Feels like a trap for me, pushing up against the wall of a building...
You're a cock-carver. You're proud of it.
There are potted plants and rare plant skins adorned with blossoms. The shape of a man's shoe.
I don't want to be here. I have so many bad things to think about right now.
Tell her this isn't about her or them -- it's about *justice*! Tell her it's for real!
"I'm sorry. I own the character." (Give her the headshot-clock.)
"What's in this?" (Shake your head.)
"How am I going to make it... could you sandwich people who kneel?"
"Ah, the year of motor carriages. And motor engines. And the Night City Scab."
Voyager is a mid-sized recording equipment company with offices in Jamrock.
The gleam in his eyes and the smelly pot in his mouth is so incredibly disgusting -- you cannot take your hands off the couch!
"Whoa, where is my back? Where's yours?"
"A *tough* negotiator. Think of it as a gift." He gestures toward the clanging of machines. "I hope you find your way through your *psycho* again."
What's going on? You're a cop. Do what you have to do to keep the bad guy away!
Kisses from adjoining skins...
"What is a mystery?"
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses? They're building a radio here.
"Watch out, Cuno! He's trying to crawl up your ass!"
"Alright, you're not going to take us seriously, are you?" He doesn't wait for your reply. "We have to investigate this murder, otherwise it's never going to happen again."
"A hole."
"I am conducting a police investigation into the bullet found at the scene. I will use it to solve a murder."
Samaran bunks, horizontal sawing, seagulls and *karapans*, these are the signatures you got. These are the pieces someone mentioned they are, or at least are pretty desperate for now.
Get your drinking on... He's only saying that you're cool because you have a record.
"Cuno's gonna have parties." He spreads his hands. "Cuno's gonna have parties!"
"No LA Times, Harry! I'm  not *on* drugs." He shakes his head. "You are a very, very smart man, Harry. Smart men are always looking for ways to *undo* reality. *Reality* is just an illusion."
"Do I look old-fashioned?"
Something to think about. (Consider.)
"I got the feeling you'll change your mind if you see my badge."
*Really*, lieutenant. This isn't the first time he's concerned about your integrity.
"Kim. I don't feel so great."
Feels great. You've given him a real rundown of what life has been like for you lately.
Goddamnit... that sounds like pyrholidon.
"Hm, I see you're in pursuit of something. A miracle. A clue. A *what*?"
Thank you, but you can't see it, because the filament is in a plastic ball inside the fridge. You need to power it from the fumes it produces.
THE EXPRESSION.
"It's not a problem, officer -- you probably have a lead on the murder investigation."
"Hey, why am I even telling you this?" He gives you an irreverent smile.
The window has been cleared. You can see the footprints coming from outside the back. Your nose is grateful.
I will destroy her. I will tear her to shreds!
"No way. That's why I have a gun. A gun for when nothing else feels like a proper police officer."
You don't have to answer that. She just won't say anything.
"No, man, I was *born* to lead." He turns to you. "We're gonna get him in there, Kim -- make his tiny hands fly! Make some chicks squeal, my man..."
"You mentioned the Doomed Commercial Area. I don't know what it's used for."
He stares at the corpse. "I don't know who I am -- I have no dignity. I have nothing."
"I was supposed to make it work, but it doesn't seem to be doing you any favors. Maybe you're looking for someone?"
Tie any terminal to a chain. (Tap on the card.)
The boy nods solemnly. "Cuno's father is dead."
"So what were we trying to prove here?"
"Wait -- not just an act -- but an attempt to create *time-factories* to produce artificial *information* -- to control the flow of events, as they occur in the world..."
"I have to say, your brother seems to be in a real *rut" -- that's *a lot* of people for such a short period of time.
*Memento mori* -- a touching narrative.
"We'll be back later." He turns on the radio. "Back to business, please."
"Oh, you mean... No. First of all -- I'm not an *ambassador*."
"I'm a policeman, I just need *satisfaction* first."
"I can see that!" He squints at you. "You are a suspect in an on-going investigation. At any rate, you're under arrest and I need your badge."
"Is there an alternative to just cutting the belt? I mean, *maybe* he had something in him that made him a sniper?"
"Why do you need the key to the car," the shopkeep puts in. "The window's not for stealing -- it's for *communicating*."
"I'm sorry I said I didn't... I really don't know." Her eyes wander to the nearby window. "You won't get shot?"
"I've just gotta get this over with, okay?" (Nod.)
"Hey, man, I don't really know how to engage somebody like that."
"I'm glad to assist you, but my business is done." He waves his hands erratically outside. "Good."
"The only way to *win* is if you *use* technology to your advantage. If you want to win, you're going to have to learn how to play by the rules."
"What's up with the cinderblocks?"
"That's enough questions for today, I had other questions." [Leave.]
"I have some questions for you now."
"I'm not really a philosopher, I'm just an old woodworker who got tired of getting lost one rainy morning and decided to look everywhere, no matter the weather."
He gestures toward the gates. "Good luck in Martinaise, if you're not staying here for *four* nights. And thank god, luck also kept me from getting shot in the leg."
"Maybe I did? I don't know. I just picked it up on an acquaintance's speed.net message board... "He nods. "I think I've heard enough about that."
"Not a particularly *bright* or *sublime* style. They prefer something more... *classic*."
"What exactly do you mean by the *coarseness*?"
"Okay, I'll go with No. 1 -- the one that fits."
"I guess I'm a hard core retrogamer now... You can say that about *any* citizen of Revachol."
No-no-no. Don't do that. It's unbecoming of a Captain Obvious at this situation. Remember when you asked her out? You should have given her the chance to change her mind?
"Don't worry, detective. We'll solve the case. Do whatever it takes, step by step. Make it look like we're trying to take care of the whole case..." He smiles.
"I'm going to turn down the volume."
"I mean in that way."
"That's the whole cast." (Wink.) "They're all here now. It's just a... hairdresser convention."
"...beating his chest, for all eternity repeating it again and again -- until the very end, when he finally... gets it -- "I know the ins and outs, I understand..."
"A *f*g*..."
"Let's go over them over again, okay? This was two weeks ago, Harry. That was *two weeks ago*."
"I have a theory to explain what's going on here."
"Of course he's not. I don't even try any more. And if I did, I wouldn't be *so* sorry."
"I don't think he did. I think he died of pneumonia in the battlefield, not rabies."
"I've never heard of that, not even from a cop. Well... yeah, I guess it's not *your* problem."
"Yes," she replies with a smile. "It could be. We need to talk to her. Let's go over it again. This time with her face."
"I think the people who build these fancy walls want to remember what they did here in the 20s -- remembering it, even. So they create these giant *remember this* things."
"Mhmh." She nods. "I'm not a huge fan of the hustle- grind, but it's always nice to think we could find some *economic* enlightenment here."
"A little. But he'd probably sell the gun now."
It is not easy to describe the experience. It is psychedelic, almost spiritual in nature. As you look around, your senses start to re-embrace your body. You are now completely re-alive.
"I knew it! I knew it! I knew the captain was hiding somewhere in Martinaise -- and even told my friend, who's also an artist, that I had news."
"Yeah, you can't hear that coming!"
"I was on the road, fucking everything. Fucked up. Nailed it! Fucked up bad."
He crosses his arms: "Cuno runs these Union down makin' five thousand cops and step-drouin' vermin out in the open like a bitch."
There, 130 kilometres to the South, the Pines send their sophomore pilots out into the grey fields somewhere south of here. In the middle of summer they send their ace pilot, Victor, into deep thought and return. He meets an old comrade, Reynold. A strange friendship exists between these two.
"You should give up, it's impossible."
He shakes his head. "I've heard enough. Let me in." (Proceed back.)
"Wait, how long ago was the 'I'?"
"I don't feel very human."
"Aye, officer, that's all I want to say about that as it relates to tonight's football game."
"A... b... c... d... e... f... g..."
"It's going to take a while for me to understand what you mean by that, though."
"It's *also* why I came all the way here. Because it's the only place I know. My family has been here for generations. For *years*."
"I have a wonderful time with my gorgeous wife, sweetie. And don't *judge* me -- as I do -- because of the *hurt* I suffered in the line of duty... I simply didn't want to judge anyone."
She winks at you. "You were asking about your life, right? So I'll answer: yes, I have a story to tell."
"The pale." (Point to your head.) "The human race is doomed. It must fall. It must die."
"And there's no one to challenge the contract!"
Your heart burns. The woman on the pier thought you would be amused. But she was expecting quite the opposite.
A silver bird? Do you have an edge against these older men?
"Yeah, well, it's just talk." He looks at his notes. "But we don't have time to explain this whole thing to you right now, so go take a look yourself."
"What do you mean --- *I should not be drinking*?"
"Hey, cop -- when are you gonna crack the case?"
"Yes I mean this. It's the opening bid of a set of thieves who made off with a rare fabled painting belonging to a local artist."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
I'd rather sit.
The door receives a thorough disciplining.
He nods gravely and continues to eat his half of the sandwich.
"It's the only carafe we found in the whole neighbourhood. It's empty."
"I *really* don't have anyone to marry, and this place does *not* want us to have kids..."
"There's gotta be a way of getting inside the building and getting to the roof. *Not* staying here long. We'll need to get *outside* the building -- back to the coast. It's too late for that yet..."
"It may have been used for long-range photography, but we could not locate any leads."
"No, that was a mistake. I don't have time for this." (Get up.)
There is a *tiny bit* of pity in him. He was in a worse place than this. In a *better place*.
"What happens now? Are you gonna keep kicking my ass and then tell me..."
"No. It wasn't me. I'm just a dumb cop who took a bullet for you."
(Point to your clothes.) "We'll go, officer."
It's not going to be that easy. Evrart wants something from you, but he won't give you the goods. You're going to have to do it yourself.
The lieutenant's right. The door is very nearly open -- you just *have to* enter.
"Don't be an irrational pessimist, Harry. This is an undertaking no sane person should be attempting." The light beams bend more like a candle, dancing on the hinges.
"Fuck is this shit? Every four seconds there's a gun shot. In the brain..." He taps his foot.
No. This fucking world is scary and inhumane and nothing anyone ever did or said said can ever get you closer to a world of love and laughter and unending realization. All is very silent in the void.
"And yet he says *all-powerful* and *welkins have white coats*. Can he take it a bit harder?"
For some reason all your assumptions were confirmed *before* that picture was taken.
"Fuck no, I don't wanna." He leans forward and starts pulling at his shirt. His eyes light up at the mention. "Cuno's gonna be like 'That's it, that was fucking awesome! We broke the color barrier!' And you're like, 'Yeah, we did.'"
She's a bit relieved it's over.
"How can I help you, officer?"
"Take my pants off."
The man doesn't respond -- just stands there, wide-eyed and looking at the sea.
"There's a... 25 EUR. It has to be for you, it has to be for the boat race."
"I saw a man asleep on the plaza. And there's a giant *aero-graffito* in front of the building now."
"He told us his business here is doing great. He even thanked you for lending him your business card. But then he screwed up and ended up owing 70,000 reál. That's right, guys. 120,000!"
(Nod.) "If you see Gary, tell him I'll mail him the money one week from La Delta. If not, we can always call him from my Kineema."
The lieutenant smiles. "Perhaps we should find another way in? The door is stuck open."
"I have other questions..." (Conclude.)
"Now that everyone is on board, it's time to get serious. We are gonna start a war. Not with them, but with the companies."
"I saw you too, miss. Were you inebriated?"
"A very dangerous and unpredictable man."
Down with the communist!
"A small wonder, yes. Though I'm sorry to hear that a good officer is dead." She nods toward Norilsk Nickel, a former miner's family and a postcard shop set on fire hard core enthusiast. A few posters still hang from the ceiling.
Wait... who killed him? Where is Titus now? Are you sure there wasn't anything else?
He was a killer. You've seen their kind before, he was a killer -- his passion, his game. This is one for the pale. *Pale* gamemaster extraordinaire.
"No no, of course not, I'm just a sorry sack of a person on drugs." he looks at his feet. "Now, play the tape you want, officer," he replies with the tip of his cigarette fume still sizzling. "You want to get to the end? Great, you got us, the door's unlocked."
"You got a point there."
"But why do you want to get to the end of the world?"
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Apologizing is the answer."
"I can see that." (Gaze at the empty bucket.)
I'll do it, tell me why the brain is broken.
No no no no. It's going too fast! It's going off the rails, there's no way to keep it down when the wheels spin and the guts rattle and you sense the blood dripping down your bare chest.
"I'm not so sure. I *did* see a shaven head. A bearded man who had dyed his hair green. I was at the Knowhere, drinking with some of his friends. A couple of us went for a swim... 
The water was cloudy that time. I heard someone shouting, so I went outside to check. I can't say I was home when the commie shot me."
"Let's do it the old fashioned way: the way of the law."
"Put the gun in my pants, Evrart!"
I'd rather cry than speak his truth.
"*I* probably did, too. I was just really agitated and acted irresponsibly. I've learned my lesson."
That's because you're weak. You're weak and alone.
A memory surfaces in her damaged neocortex -- it's not unpleasant, per se, but it does present a little pause at the very end, as she's forced to re-contextualize it in some kind of *now* context.
The lieutenant looks at the mechanism overhead. "Ah, yes. Well, this one can definitely help with that -- it's a magnetic accelerator."
This must be it. The basement door is weather-worn, and has an old rubber handle. Its yellow handle is dripping wet...
"Oh my god! It's the answer to almost any question!"
"Okay, maybe not *entire universes* but still -- I really don't care for you either, cop. Even if you're the star of one episode of *Persona*, you're always going to be a sour apple for everybody. So don't cry, *partying* is *funny*."
"A better sound system?" He looks around, shaking his head. "The old guy's got money -- but not *enough* money."
"It's also got something to do with the Void Invaders. My theory."
She laughs: "Well, sir, you're our next target. It's on, let's get it started!"
"Okay. What's this about?" The lieutenant raises his pistol and takes aim at you.
"Oh, *perfectionists*. I'm not a gardener by trade and there's no one to hire from here." She crosses her arms.
"I don't believe this shit." The lieutenant's eyes narrow.
"I don't think I'm a murderer, I'm a policeman."
"You're sure that both of them are nice people, right?"
(Look at your soaked notes.) "The weird thing is -- I *did* read them."
"Okay. So what. What else has your investigation produced so far?"
"So *I* am now. But I am sorry to inform you that our arrangement with the Union is not going to change. You will have to ask Evrart about this."
"So you're evasive. You know where we are."
"You don't think it's the real murderer who was hired by the scapegoated bourgeoisie? Maybe you killed him."
He purses his lips. "I guess it makes sense, no? At the very least. It's the *opposite*. Of course. A pro -- a sniper, the enemy. I condone it. And I know you do too. Now... did you eat it for dinner? Or did you leave it out on the balcony?"
"You can find Evrart Claire on the plaza, in the store where you pawned off your sidearm." He points to the balcony. "He's the head of the Débardeurs' Union."
"That's right, Harry!" He slams his fist on the table. "Heads up -- this escalates into a full-out war. We're way in now."
"This is a rather high-pitched sound -- and I really don't know how to respond."
"So the phasmid was a *self-replicating bullet*."
You feel the lieutenant's hand on your shoulder. You're in charge of the *interactive voice chat*. He looks you in the eye -- two black beads, moist from the sea air. You're *transparent*.
(Turn to the lieutenant.) "Just tell me the goddamn name of the dead man."
The old man falls silent, staring at the reeds, then continues coughing.
"How much of a *share* would you prefer?"
She has an understanding of the powers that be, though -- but she's unwilling to put her finger on it.
The lieutenant nods.
"No need to rush."
"I'm here to get drunk and make money so I can go to the next town."
I like this -- keep the focus on it and move on.
"*You* don't know? Are you investigating these things now? Or are you -- some kind of... *green*?"
"That's all for now." (Conclude.)
No -- it was her doing, after all.
"Well, good for you."
"Mhm. It's in the waters."
SHIT ON MY HANDS. ROUND HOUSE KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS
"Maybe the phasmid has... forgotten it *completely*?"
"Cuno's fucking done and now you want Cuno? Pigs throw water at Cuno like that. Tell him to lay off it." He points to the bottle.
"Yes, yes, that could very well have been it. It's a mystery."
It's hard to tell if she is counting or not. This was supposed to be one little thing.
"So how about we change it to something else? Quizzes? A test?"
"*Nothing*. Please continue, I'm really trying to help you."
"Oh, nothing." She takes a long sip from her seemingly endless supply of herbal teas.
He looks around, thinking it over. "Well, okay. The phasmid is the product of my relationship with the rain..." He pauses in shock. "You! Are you alive?!"
"I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me."
"Are we done here, Gary? I thought we were supposed to be together..."
What she means is that she's not a market researcher, she's a market researcher. You've convinced yourself of that fact, haven't you?
"Well sir, it doesn't sound like that pig's around here." She glances at the posters in the dusty yard.
There are posters everywhere. In the bus station, near the bookshop...
"He's a monster. A walking scab, that's what it is."
Okay! You've earned a bit of flak, from that player! But don't give it to 'pig*, Cuno doesn't give a shit about the rules!
"I don't want to be the one who breaks it to you, Harry. I just want to do my job, that's all."
It's because you've already taken the head off. The creature's hide is as tough and resilient as steel. It will happily eat any leg of your new uniform.
"The Headless FALN Rider?"
That's correct. You have no idea who this Miss Beaufort is, how could you? Where she is, you can't say. You are pretty sure it didn't pilfer her from you.
Is she afraid?
"I can see that you're having trouble remembering. I'm sure we are missing something -- and that you'll get over it."
"I want to get in, but I have some questions before you can."
"Okay, so I took the *gate*." (Proceed.)
The boy's mind is the prize in this game. Forget about your worries. Jump ahead, the gates open.
"What are you doing?" The young woman looks at you inquisitively.
Should we be trying the *sample* of cocaine that's being supplied?
"It means I'm paranoid, that I'm a cop. Haven't I ever been?"
That's just ridiculous. I don't need to know what this *galactical* contraption does, I just need to fire a gun at something or run for the hills...
The man rubs his chin, laughing. "Well, yes.." he smiles. "There was a guy in container. A Cuno or something."
"Do we?" the woman looks up. "Sure. Why not."
In this yard you see *rare species* and a large number of unknown sub-fictures. Most of which have no basis in reality.
You *just* look at the bottle of wine the lieutenant brought you. For now, all you can see is a bright blue liquid staring back at you from the crown of his crystal cane.
"Yeah. We should explore the church somehow. See what treasures lie within."
"I have an indirect role to play here."
"I see." The lieutenant tilts his head slightly, as he looks to the door. "I cannot for what it is, but I can help you."
"Yeah, that's *shit*. You people are so sick. When I walked the desert I felt great sadness and a longing to heal."
"Good to meet you, Just-A-Gardener. Another question."
She was just about to go into shock.
Look around in the room first.
The boy's mind is the prize in this game. Forget about your worries. Jump ahead, the gates open.
"What are you doing?" The young woman looks at you inquisitively.
For the *sample* of cocaine that's being supplied.
"It means I'm paranoid, that I'm a cop. That's probably why. Haven't I ever been?"
That's just ridiculous. I don't need to know what this *galactical* contraption does, I just need to fire a gun at something or run for the hills...

"Good to meet you, Just-A-Gardener. Another question."
She was just about to go into shock.
Look around in the room first.
"*Sod off*? I do that sometimes," he shrugs. "It's not *sad*, it's just unfortunate."
"I don't want to be the one who breaks it to you, Harry. I just want to do my job, that's all."
It's because you've already taken the head off. The creature's hide is as tough and resilient as steel. It will happily eat any leg of your new uniform.

That's correct. You have no idea who this Miss Beaufort is, how could you? Where she is, you can't say. You are pretty sure it didn't pilfer her from you.
Is she afraid?
"This was probably a misunderstanding."
"Don't you guys have some kind of... backyard?"
"No. I don't think she hanged him. I think she was just in a hurry."
"I just wanted to know if you were one of those drunks who likes to hide behind weird names?"
What is this? An elimination ritual? Insidiousness! It makes you go *its* head, rips your mind apart.
He looks at you expectantly.
"I'm still not entirely sure... some people might."
"I got a feeling the Hardie boys are gonna be alright."
"Yeah, that's why I said *hard core*."
"I saw him through a window -- just a weak light blue hour would have belonged to its blacklisted area. I could see the tip of the bullet in his temple."
(Point to yourself) "Right at the moment your eyelids start twitching, like the hand of a spider."
"I don't think so." He tries to focus on the tape recorder.
"And where is your..."
"Let's return to this later, Cuno. I find this topic tiresome."
"Okay. Where were we?"
"No... no, no, I didn't understand it was *illegal*." She raises her hands in mock sympathy. "I wouldn't have done it, it's not like anyone's gonna use a lame man for a spy."
"No." He looks you straight in the eye. "There is still something I can do for you." He pauses. "I can help with the body, get some rest. If you need..."
"There you have it, you're the last man standing when it happens. Have something else? You've got your shit together, Harry." He gestures around you. "We're all waiting."
"Aye, I guess you are. What do you need?"
"Don't listen to me. You wanna be a clairvoyant? You wanna be *right behind me in the Hanged Man's head*?" He adjusts his glasses. "Try not to shit yourself, you'll make it all right."
"Let's just leave it at that."
"Yes, I was *impersonating* her. Like a fucking dolphin. And she didn't even recognize it! I would have to physically run to my 'husband' mode -- because I just can't get out of this..."
"So what's next? You want *fuck* to it?"
"You're not shitting me, are you?"
"I'm going to think about it. Say it right."
"I am a revolutionary in every way. From the streets to the steppes, from the bedroom to the grocery store." His eyes meet yours. "I will end all exploitation and bring the people the bread they deserve."
Do you have any recordings of the past, Joyce?"
You must have really liked the hat.
Something cracks in the man's left side! A cruel jest -- he straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
"I know how we could settle this -- we could dance!"
You have to juggle school and communism. Go to school, get your *grade* set -- eat the rich!
"I'm sharing it -- because I * want* it. Because I * believe in you'. And I can't have you become pets on the altar of Capital. *No one* should ever, ever have children of their own."
C'mon... you're turning into some kind of super-detective.
The Presence, in all likelihood, is a hybrid of the two...
"Mm, uhh... never mind."
Imagine it! Imagine what would happen if you tried to use the phone as it makes history...
Longing... you should inspect the creature's other side for signs of struggle, before you say anything.
Doesn't feel like the heat is doing anything for you?
"How am I going to respond to this?" He turns to his companion: "You're a brave cop, you're a fine example of a good *copotype*."
To *Tequila Sunset*, the morning light!
The gesture was a sign from the past. So were their names.
"Eh, I'm the one who sells drugs."
"I am drawn to the historic opportunity to start a rock and roll club in the 45th Precinct."
The world is made of rope, and the users are made of wood. Materials such as us resist all forces but burn with ease.
oy, this is super weird. They can't even consider the risk associated with bringing a player into the scene. And, of course, they wouldn't want to hang anyone.
Disappointed?" He looks around, then points to the door. "Why don't you go, huh?"
"Where can I get a bag?"
"I'm not a moribund alcoholic. I just like doing my job. Now how can I help you?"
"In there deep, some creature moved its head and, unseeing it, it crawled back to feast on its dead master." He eyes the sea island slowly.

Why am I talking to you?
A crinkled case. There is.
Time to think about it harder.
Your cordial pleas for cash flow are unceremonious.
The Décomptage was a subterfuge used to hide the communists. Probably a trick.
*Or* you could do it all yourself.
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards, like a river. The morning light pierces the deep, while the city below is just as silent.
Holy hell, they totally deserve it!
"What?" He turns his head and points to you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
Another hallway?
What is this art-fascist doing?
"I'm sorry it's been such a long time since I last saw you around..."
The power's pretty tight.
Don't get it, it's too complicated.)
You know what a ladybug is, right ?
Vortigern, the temple of Immortis Amicita, the womb of the World, the Source of all evil.
Welcome to the untethered world.
Not that you've seen him around. Not in your life. Just the winding shaft of the shaft. Glazed, rigid, staring at the dust.
*Armistice? Sounds like coach to me*.
"It's okay. You're just making the situation worse for the Union."
"I've been trying to talk to you. You're being *hypnotized* by the Streets. I know you're worried about it, but... it's not like that."
*What?* you think. But don't. The boots are unimportant to this case.
Something is off here... maybe you're in his head?
"Alright, enough of this." (Conclude.)
"The competition." She nods. "From the coast. From the prybar."
*We're* not conducting a search of evidence, officer!
What is going to happen?
This is a sound. It points outward, like a bellow. The glass of wine is warm and inviting...
He stands there motionless. The corpse has moved little by little, no larger than a shard of white thread hanging from the crane's beams.
"I've got Col Do Ma Ma Daqua --" He turns to you. "And *questions*. There are many about this duo. Do you have the most or don't you want to know?"
You've done this before. It's not so much the truth, but rather the very *perfection* of it all.
Marching...
Is it any good? You feel like your cloak is going to break under the strain. Or maybe it's the others that are to blame?
You're *sure* about that.
"IT IS. THE WORLD IS A VISION. I CAN ONLY SEE WITH VISION, THOUGHT AND MATERIALISM. THAT IS MY SPECTACLE FROM OFF AND ON."
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have known you'd be staying here that long.
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you. "You look down on people? Try putting a gun to your head."
Art's hard.
"I'm done." (Relinquish the moment.) "The world is white."
"Quiet?"
Getting drunk is never a good idea. At least not for this cop-man.
"Hm, that's what I said. Sorry."
But now I understand. When you're old and shaggy, the jeans aren't terrifyingly light. And the booze doesn't do anything for you... at least not that long.
"I have a bad feeling about this lynching. It's not good." (Proceed.)
You're right, it's bird shit.
Cha-ching! It's coming to, BOOGIE-GOODY-HEARD!
"I'm a realist. Let's bring those questions to the front."
"Filippe, the Cop of the Apocalypse."
Guess not.
Knocked out, muttering to himself: *fuck it*...
Read about the ancient mysteries of time and space.
"*Mon dieu*? What do you mean?"
Warpainted yourself?
"I really don't think you're being *fair* about this Ruby. You're a detective."
"I assure you, I'm *not* part of that drug trade."
"No, no-no. It's just hair."
Serial #28. The hulking, 8.6 mm man with dark hair and a face like that of a gremlin.

"In essence, it's *copernican*. It's the international community that owns this city."
"I found some speaker-microphones in a box of ice."
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!"
Holding the world together.
Barry was trying to impress certain people with his motor skills.
You've got to work with this one. You're not alone.
"I don't know who he *is* -- he's dead. He's hung from that tree I painted ten years ago." He points at him.
"Are you alright, Alice? You were drunk."
"No, I don't. I don't produce any more as a result. And I don't produce many of those."
"I'm absolutely okay. You don't have to be like me -- and you don't have to tell me that you're racist."
Not quite sure about the second part.
"To catch a fly you need two skills, crossing the tiniest of them." She narrows her eyes. "The first is convincing the lorrymen they can get out of the harbour before the second is ready. They must fear the Landing."
"No. It's a safety hazard. I don't want to discuss it."
"What's in this world?" (Proceed.)
"Good, you're doing great!" He shouts at the bar. "Go ahead, I'll feed you to the dogs! Go ahead, Lena!" He turns to face you.
"I *may* have a shackle on it." She taps on the side of her chair. "It's made of metal and has been used to put her on one for killing people."
YOURSELF IS NOT A MELANCHOUCHISM OF BODY AND FEATURES. YOU REEL LIKE AN INEXPLICABLY MADE YOUTH CAGE.
*Dozens* of them.
"The Coalition?" The lieutenant looks worried. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."
"He doesn't even have a name." She shrugs. "It was probably Gottlieb Königsteiner. He only had a stage name --Gottlieb." She gives you a crooked smile. "He died last week. Best thing that ever happened to him."
"Of course," she nods. "We do the honour and the pigs do the honours."
"I have a feeling... you would also want to talk to me about the *suspects* Klaasje and the man who drowned in his room."
She smiles and your eyebrows arch. She's been listening, but not when you asked her about her husband.
"I am. And you should tell me." (Point at your head.)
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body."
* *Cuno*," he says, holding a pen in one hand and a pen in the other.
"I'm sorry, sir, I just don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Conclude)
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese lay-over from all manner of exotic nations and ethnicities.
"I'm a regular enough cop to get my fix. You may still opt to opt out, though."
*Your* name is *alright*!
A broken down boat, painted black.
"I met your future husband, he's always there, just checking out the situation. Helping me sort this mess out."
"I am not shitting myself -- I will not."
A clumsy fail, lieutenant.
"I don't know such things..."
"Yes, I found it."
Correctness is a quality of being unsure of what to believe. He also has a way of knowing when to experiment by looking at the contradiction.
*Everything* about this cop seems to be off, but why? Why aren't you the god damn creative genius you were? You just *had* to make this up.
"Funny," the lieutenant says. "You're in a hurry to jump to conclusions."
"Welcome," the lieutenant closes his notebook and takes a deep breath.
"Right. Well." He tilts his head slightly, as if in recognition. "Anyway, what can I help you with?"
"S-why would I want to molest a child?" He sighs.
"I'll see where this is going." [Leave.]
"Suppressing this spirit has been really, really effective."
"Hi, I'm the voice mail operator."
Don't be too sound. It's okay to be scared.
"No, I meant to *not* say that. Grand prize."
"I found a small shred of a framed photograph, taken in that city a long, long time ago. Who knows how it got there?"
The thought comes to you. You should impress him by *not* stealing. Wealth by the days would make you a burden to society.
The thought comes to you, as you slowly close your eyes -- and the fear is palpable.
We could talk about his homo stuff, if we were really interested in his life...
"Ruby?" (Point at the mattress.)
"Extravied my visor."
"Authority?"
The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She pulls out a zip bag and holds it in her supra-clastic arms.
In conclusion -- it's time to compete! Raise your standards, fellows. Be a competent piece of art.
Write a thesis!
"What?" She looks down at her body. "I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!"
What does a plural mean?

Up on Old Cinema, across the canal. Light reflects off your arches. Your colonized nomadic tribes are enjoying a stroll through land unknown.
"Did you want to be a witch?"
"Enough gloating. This is serious. It's a fireable offence in Revachol."
All right..." he's not going to leave now.
"I found this socialist woman." (Consider.)
He stares at the familiar necktie and rooster-shirt -- then at you. "But you're not a cop, you're a hero."
"I know what I saw: a massive black hole present on the Insulindian isola."
" -- you look like a fucking idiot, asshole."
"Oh, who cares? That's not the point. The point is -- this jacket would fit just fine in a crowd of people."
*Dead*? That doesn't sound like a good idea either.
"I am undergoing a little over a week of *personal reflection* during this phase. What next?"
"Funk turned himself in to the Cuno. Somethink with a straight face."
*Your* spirit animal? You're out to get him, Harry. This is serious.
no, of course not... the gun is in your hand and it will shoot him. No need for this.
Sure, you're drunk. But that doesn't mean you should open fire.
"They also, like, fell into the trap of *rebellious* self defence against gunfire." He pauses. "Like you."
Somewhere asleep, inside the cold steel of a tent.
*I* think I'm dead.
You're Acting Like a Cock-Cavalier.
"I would like some of that wealth, please."
"I've done this job for long enough to know that no matter how hard I try, failure will always follow. Even if it doesn't."
The situation stands. Your feet feel like they're on fire. The cold is sharpening your vision.
Slap yourself.
Welcome to the Revolution, boy.
"I am conducting an inter-departmental investigation. You will be taken to the city of Revachol."
"I'm a real rebel."
he then realizes something, looking at his wrist: *Why?*
"You're not the police. You're a mercenary."
Getting up... feels good. This was good high-quality behaviour...
*Alessandro*, I *am* glad you're alright. Just go and report this.
You're a fucking vegetable. You're a fucking predator. We've got to calm you down."
"Standard, I was just wondering..."
"Well, I understand." The man takes a step back. "You have to admit... this situation... this situation..." he whispers, "needs a *changed* name."
"What can you tell me about this... homo-sexual?"
****************'s...
It's not a phasmid. It's just a sound. It's just an old, tired sound.
The Stormers have found a new home. Perhaps they will find a new purpose -- in communion with him.
"I did," the lieutenant nods. "We can get more speed here. I have a room down at the Whirling-in-Rags."
"I have a feeling... you have a problem with alcohol."
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's nice enough, in a way -- it's not great.
"Dora?" she whispers. "The wind has already turned the building into a concrete slab. It has started to do its thing. It's done to get people killed."
"In this case, I'm thinking of calling police *all the time*."
While your hands are trying to grasp the pieces hidden in the depths of the Invisible Continent, a shimmering ocean of dead and dying hair, clothing, and fish, your fingertips touch the word *Feld* with their own beauty...
*BLOW HIM!*
"It's a pity. We don't have anything to do now. We have to get the body down from the tree."
The wind picks up and the buoy slides down.
"The officer will be contacting the ICP database shortly. We will have a follow up on this lorry if there are any further missing persons."
"I lost my spine."
"I can't leave the doorbell alone like that. I need to talk to Morell first, find the gun that shot him."
"I'm sorry, I'm stupid."
"I am blasting it. The tribunal will prove very useful in court."
"At the end we talked. She said the only way to solve the case is by guerilla warfare."

"Didn't you see that they were setting up a *rare archaeological site* near the seafort... And they were killing people there."
"I'm going to the island."
"I haven't been... *much* happy for taking on this. For reaping benefits, of course. You can complain about it, but you don't. It's only *ineffectual*."
"I'm still looking." (Point to the night club.)
What does it look like?
"What?" He turns his head and points to you: "You fucking f****t son of a bitch! What are you doing, fucking *anyone*?!"
Broken-up window... hold still.

"I'm sick and tired of this commie shit. You fucking son of a bitch! You gotta let Cuno shit out with you, Cuno's got it under control." He kisses the corner.

"Filippe III, king of the *näkkies* -- was an *autocrat*. He cracked, cracked like a cracked egg. Disarmed by the reaction of the moment, the will of a man defeated by it..."
"I am beginning to suspect we are in the middle of something," she says, her voice suddenly very calm. "But the shot actually came from the roof, behind us..."
"I'm a realist." He nods, approvingly.
"I'm a... the law!"
"Shit, Cuno, what are you doing?!"
"People say Wild Pines is trying to curb free speech, but..." He frowns. "I would never shut up."
"Hey, can I get one of those real good sunglasses you're currently wearing?"
Read, drink and die. [Finish thought.]
On the sleeve of his armoured minivacer, police detective Angus 'The Rock' McCoy polishes off some dirt and falls into it.
Pardon me, I just don't understand what you just said, this is police-work and you got a *gun* on your back?
"Oh?" The kids are playing outside, by the pier.
Not your svelte suspect, this one's a worker.
"Well, I've turned it off!" She is furiously turning on the radio. "Mystery solved!
The name sounds preposterous to Cuno.
"You were *that* good. Faking death was your plan A, was scamming your friend out of money plan B? You *really* wanted that, didn't you?"
The Type-99 is a premium motor carriage with a displacement of 2,200 tons. It is often described as the most rugged machine you will ever ride.
Sent by the Ptolemy A to M. Bad news, bad news. Sounds like this is gonna be a fiasco. You know, because everyone in the Union knows.
The thought makes your muscles tense up. It's not death, it's panic.

There's a huge pot full of fuckin' flaming embers going *into* the wall.
I don't want to say it.
Have I ever killed anyone? (Point at his head.)
Time for your room. The smell of rotten food has rubbed off on you. More liquor still in the air. And a touch of sweat.
"Aren't you a bit of an asshole yourself?"
The Asuncion.
"It's a lie. Powerful multinational interests against everyone."
"I'm sorry, sir, I didn't mean to say that. I'm Revacholian."
You've given the order to close the shop.
"I'm a bad ass man."
What's going on? Just look at that fucking *shit*! We're going to have a field day with this!
"Pleasure to meet you," the lieutenant interjects. "Tea, tea, and ZEMARIA! A real monument to the purity of bourgeois culture."
"Never lost your mind. You'll do it, I promise."
This is probably what's going to happen.
"Where are these roads?" (Search the city for your lost locusts.)
So, you're not coming anywhere? Or ever. Ever wished you were?
As I should be, what's the next step?
"He's a colourful fellow, he comes with a..." He pauses to think. "Cockatoo."
"Hey, what's on your mind?"
"It's okay. It's not my idea. I'm sure it's a nice thought. You should read the rest."
"They couldn't just open it. They had to keep it in."
"I don't know what I was thinking, but if you don't like it, I can always amend it."
Last winter a very cold wind came violently up over the city. Snow disappeared into the flake of light below her feet. She shuddered and looked down, icy flakes melting from the jacket. It was cold, more like a freezing snow than a corpse.
*Organized* means organized crime. Organized crime is organized.
Reality?- oh, this is very close...
"What did you *not* do, boiadeiro?" The wind blows through your hair. You feel your hands on your head again.
"I'm surprised it's still there. It was almost completely inaccessible before the tenant started coming and going."
"It's a long story." He takes the pyrholidon and rubs it in his fingertips with his thumb. "I doubt it will do anything."
"What is a recording?"
"These are the same boots. You're pretty sure the entire Hardie boys are wearing them."
"88 *Confirmed kills*," he replies, absent-mindedly. "That's what I'm here to investigate. The communists shot that guy, too, but that was all stopped."
"He *took* me for example -- that's how serious an officer I am."
Gimme the gun, I already threw up...

Son, you're spooky as hell! (The push comes from the back.)

With its horns and gills pointed at the sun, the insect spins its complex web of teeth.
The shape of the horns and gills tells you everything you need to know about its many, many lights and its many mysterious purposes.

A brief spike of rage in her shoulders. This is the one thing she *has* won over the Cafeteria Manager: her friends.
How do I know what the pale sounds like?
Harry doesn't know what to say. The lieutenant just stares at you with a stern fellow.
Patrol Officer Uuno is at your side, watching you struggle with your mental illness. She says to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?"
The catch phrase is meant to be funny, but also very serious thoughts. Don't overthink it.

"You said: I need a cut of the pie."
If you want to be the detective, you'll have to do some *some* detective work.
WRONG. There is a reason why every human being should be able to rely on their environment for their survival...
"I got it, officer! Thank you for reporting this horrific event." (Conclude.)
Sure, you don't want to waste time alone with bad people. Time to become a real police officer. Not a bartender. Not a polluter. Just a regular cop. A real policeman.
Centuries are just theoretical time tricks. You've seen it all, you can still make sense of it later.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to do things differently. The public has already heard of you."
"I'm afraid..." The man assesses the situation. "I don't know anything about that. I think it's a mix-up."

The blanket feels cold. You're looking at it, too, comforted in its weight. It's not entirely useless.
