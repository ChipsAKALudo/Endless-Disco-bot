He surveys the coast, then City Hall: "The people who built this world intended it to be better for *us* -- they wanted to do it with spectacle. Made the sculpture out of marble, you see. They wanted to replace it with a new image of the world, one which would be better for investment. So they came up with the idea of a man being on the street."
Man from Hjelmdall is a character in the PA system created by Tormod Brunestud and Fernando Almeida to make it easier to execute the contract negotiations. It should be noted that this is not a stand-alone character, but just a pathogen that infects a number of other players all the same.
"They couldn't get a lock on that forklift, they couldn't get into the harbour. The censorship team was able to get in once we finished with the main investigation, but it wasn't fast enough, and the mercenaries were burning through what seemed to be a sea of information."
The house is filled out in multiple ways. The floor plan is divided into three main sections; the living room, kitchen and bathroom. There are two bedrooms in the first one, a large balcony and a small kitchen. The second and third have separate lighting setup in the sky.

"Yeah, yeah. It's like an obsession with the past. Like, you like the way the statue looks, or the way the memorial wall looks..." He squeezes the words out. "But there's nothing like the memory of the dead man. All it does is make you feel like an *allegorical* corpse."
"We don't convict. We arrest and send them to Coalition Government courts -- in Couron and La Delta. The prosecution works off our testimonies. And records -- which is why it's paramount to keep them." He pats his pockets, where a small sandpaper note has been attached.
He was out partying the night before murdering him, drinking hard that night; she was on the balcony when it happened. And she was pretty cold that night, so what she needed to do was *get the body of the dead guy* into her apartment -- and not break the snow inside."
"Drug trade? Now you're being stupid, Harry. There are perfectly legal, 100% ethical chemical factories on the Samaran isola. You're part of the diversity! The sun is shining and we're all going to be together, regardless of your *belief* in the soft-core lifestyle."
"The RCM makes everything possible! I bring you the same respect and attention to the mentally handicapped as I did to the murderers..." She's silent for a second. "You really need to realize -- the RCM does not have the same power to overrule the Débardeurs' Union."
"Oh, we've *had* to keep the peace," he answers for the two rebels. "And now we're being forced to get even worse... twice a week the pirates are still showing up and beating small children and *women*. In the evening the drunks are *harassing* the local residents."
"The world we live in is not fair. No matter what we say, people will see us -- and hate us. That's how the *economics* work." He shrugs. "But you have my sympathies. And I'd wager a *lucrative* sum of money that the people you work for still haven't forgotten you."
"What does your heart tell you about your lost gun, Harry? Does it tell you to forget about it? Or do you think it wants to be found?" He picks something from his teeth. "I think it's lonely and cold. I think it wants to be found and I have a proposal for you."
"I learned that there are *three* types of *dry* boots in the world. The boot on the left, the boot on the right -- the one on the left is the *saddest* type. The boot on the right, the boot on the left is the *wackiest* type. But all three are for *women*."
"We're all striving to do what's best for Martinaise here." His smile widens. "Don't feel like you can't cooperate with her, because you and I are such good friends and I tried to help you with the body... *and* finding your lost gun. I'm not a jealous guy."
"But I won't bore you with details. For one, I'm not a *sorrent* myself." She turns to you. "But, man, it's nice to think that I *have* to go over my notes from that night. How else would have told you? Anyway... you ask away, I'm always happy to help out."
*Pissing* *Fucking* yes*... there are *Cuno's* everywhere. Every fucking street, every fucking alleyway. And that's just the street we found. Some of them even had *tape*. If we could find other ones, we *would*! I've already been here seven years now..."
You take the documents out from the box: a 12-40 month construction period, and the zoning plan in the envelope. In the top right corner, it says "ZEROLAND" and signed by something named *HENRY*. A white rectangle in the bottom right says "STATION CALL".
"It's an illness. He's been throwing up blood since winter. It's been passed -- probably by his fingers. It's a... unpleasantly beautiful thing. But it is what it is. Given where he's from, I don't think he'd rather be *paranoid* than what he is now."
"It's the type of man who goes around asking women, 'How did I have my say?' Then one of them shivers and falls flat in the saddle," he says, unimpressed. "That is what I saw the other night when I was *trying* to explain this to a bunch of bimbos."
"THE INDIGINOUS PEOPLE OF THIS PLANET ARE INHABITUALLY DEFORMED AND SLEEPY,LIETH FOR IMMEDIATE PERIKAR NON-COMPLICABILITIES. THE INGENETIC PEOPLE OF URUNDUS,I ACTED AS THEY HAVE DONE KNOWN AS A GENETIC CANOE THAT REPENDS UNDER THE GRAVITY OF URUNCY
"It didn't do *anything* but I was like a little super-detective. So cool... so I did. Until I'd passed out. Or asked the miss who's looking for me out. She came over and shook my hand. Then she lifted me out of the water and looked at something."
"No, I didn't -- I did get to the other side of the fence. There was a locked gate on the other side, which I had to look through. The electronic lock to the gate room was broken, so I used a crowbar to get inside. Then I saw a man in FALN pants."
The middle has a built-up of accumulated rust, starting with the foundation. The walls are cracked and the footing of the room (the pyramid first) crumble's beading so thoroughly some kind of... structural solution is holding the four of you back.
"A furious wriggling sound, like the rattling of a rope at the end of a chainlink fence. The lieutenant is gone now, the lights in the sewer light show me a man in the middle of a shift change of role. Still, the dead man is more dead than I am."
"But I also have a *couple of* *I've* got to share with you. I'm constantly reminded of my *pale* existence. It's the most glorious thing I've ever known. I just want to spend time with my partner. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever known."
"We're getting there, officer. We're getting *there*..." He nods towards the gates, slowly rocking back and forth. "I see that you don't like this, it's all related, and I can say right now we are approaching the *limit* of your... exploration."
"I'm not being so charitable as to call the *Klaasje* an eccentric. She has a point. However, she might also be a competent scientist on her own right -- one who might have an *object-level* job, and make use of the tools of advanced physics."
"Over? It was *over* when they shelled the coast... and bodies ripped apart from the pressure. It was a fucking massacre. We went in and scoured the place. We found bodies, blood everywhere. We took a fucking bullet out of a dead man's head."
"The CNMT is the Japanese name for the Bank of Nanjing. It was founded in '07 in what was then called the *Revolutionary* Republic of Luau-Kaunas..." She doesn't look at her notes. "To ensure the security of the existing unity of the nation."
"You're right. There are *two* of them. The one in the bathroom is the one with the large head. It's the one that's drifting in the night." He inspects the other one, then the room. "*Tape* is the most *portable* thing in the world... right?"
"You're right. There are *two* of them. The one in the bathroom is the one with the large head. It's the one that's drifting in the night." He inspects the other one, then the room. "*Tape* is the most *portable* thing in the world... right?"
"They're not *really* digging what's happening here. Yes, we do have some street lights that only let you *sit* -- and that doesn't look like a good place to hide something, even for someone who's been here a lot. So I'm not going to do it."
A once-bright mural on the Châte River, 200 metres from here, casting the light of its collapsing ruins onto the water. The building was built by the first settlers and then expanded by the bourgeois *in your* lif, until it collapsed in '31.
"There is no catch. These seven honest men have *equally* come forth to tell you what happened -- so that you don't waste any more of your time." He smiles. "Let's try to find a new tape player, maybe we should talk to Roy at the pawnshop."
"As you can see, the bullet is *not* the same caliber as the one we found in the victim's head. This bullet is a calibre of .45 -- a *super* caliber. So much so that even the most *experienced* hunters can't tell you what calibre it was."
"As you can see, the bullet is *not* the same caliber as the one we found in the victim's head. This bullet is a calibre of .45 -- a *super* caliber. So much so that even the most *experienced* hunters can't tell you what calibre it was."
"I can't believe you're being so *dramatic*. Boring. Don't let it wear you out. Don't let it wear you down playing the game. It's just *one* touch away." He rubs his hands together. "I'm one of the most sentimental people in the world..."
"It doesn't matter, you're *too* old -- and sick. You only became a cryptozoologist to catch a rare parasite. It doesn't matter in the *long* run. The more *relevant* you think the case is, the less likely it becomes to just be a hunch."
"It's okay. I got punched hard in the face. I didn't kill him either. It's just a hell of a lot harder than my average *identification* as a *approaching* person with a *dysterias* past. No one's gonna put their phone up against my ear."
"Oh no, I'm not kidding. *I* didn't call you, I didn't read the letter. What I learned was you *need* to be alive to be taken to the Island. The Pact of the Elders -- you need to be alive while it's waiting for you to be taken there..."
This is ridiculous. It's stupid, it's boring, everyone's going to die because it's just *tape rotation*. Nobody's gonna make it. I'm not even gonna get into the *why* or how *it* happened, because that's *too much* for even an engineer.
"I'm not a *symbolist*, Harry. I'm a realist. My statue will be Martinaise rebuilt: five story building complexes, kids off speed and landowners in Ozonne *hating* me. That will be my statue -- *and* yours. We're doing this together."
"This is a *welcome* to the Inner-Cities. No one goes to the Inner-Cities to deal with people with *less* than they already are. The Inner-Cities are for people who have been through the death spiral before, who are just *not* human."
"Somewhere, three police officers are looking for and chasing a crew member suspected of killing an unarmed sailor. The clue -- found in the apparent murder scene. But not in all the clues. The clue... was planted somewhere else..."
"The world is silent on that rooftop -- the wind howls outside, the sea outside... Where have you been? There were people there too. Why? And it's not just Cuno, I'm sure." He gives the woman a knowing nod and turns to face the sea.
"This is a *cadre*. It means those guys are *cadres* as well. The only reason they aren't is because they live in a *lucre* that's more like a *lucre* than a *lau*. It is quite *large*, indeed. In fact, we should have *found* them."
"You can try not to do that. If your investigation happens to take you to Jamrock, there's a cool school of philosophy there, where you can get all the *mulkkupää* from." He appears to discuss something with the corner of his mouth.
"The Perikarnassian Church is about *love*! Anodic music is about *love*! I got love for my Perikarnassian posse, *love* is the relay out of death! WE DANCE!!!" He violently shakes the tape player, as if to see if he can break it.
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scabs -- digging around -- anyone knows what I mean. And they're all doing fine, so I guess they're not really gonna get any help from here."
"Oh, my god! What, you're afraid you'll miss out on some of the great sordid mysteries of our time, because I won't tell them what the Union is about?" He lets the silence linger, then concludes: "Good luck with your questions."
"Yes, your partner is a legend in the neighbourhood. He died a hero -- but he had other problems. One was he stole from the rich. To get rich he was even... broke himself. But his partner did the same. A good man. A super-hero."
"No, there are *multiple* good options here, Harry. You could try pushing the. You'll likely need to add a *safety* layer to deal with the lack of electricity. Cuno's got a heart attack problem, so you'll need to pump it out."
"You're right. I don't want to know about the others. I just want to know about you." He turns to you. "I'm sorry, detective. It's one of the things I hold dear to myself -- my deep and abiding love for the city of Revachol."
"A year ago we were teenagers, but I have no problem with my friends bothering me." He nods, his expression almost apologetic. "Thank you for reading. You did good. I hope you find your way through your own troubles. Go on."
"That's a strange request. I wouldn't normally call someone who makes faces like this. If it's supposed to be a clownish prank, it's certainly not meant as such. I think the line of questioning was done by the wrong caller."
"*BZOOT-BAG*. THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S BZOOT-BAG. I'VE SEEN MY BODY REMAINING A FLAWLESS OPPOSITE OF MYSELF -- ALL LIVELY WITH MY FALN-SKULLS ON. YOU ARE A LITTLE TOO OLD YOUR FUCKING MIND AGAIN. YOU'LL NEVER SEE THE LAST OF ME."
"The great river of science and the industrial revolution, the Great Flood of '49, the scourges of the sea, the greatest polar ice caps -- all of it -- was our time. It's the *last* chapter of the great cycle of the world."
"I'll be honest with you, the social situation here is nothing to brag about. It's... a bit..." he gives you a sideways glance. "We could probably do with a bit more social cohesion, though -- at least for the time being."
"Okay, I admit it -- I made that move because I wanted to be *cool* with the Cuno. You wouldn't appreciate it anyway, so I went along. It was a mistake. I shouldn't have done it, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the *fuck*."
Your eyes light up from the distance. The street signs on the corner are still there, they are still there, but now they are not as vibrant. They have faded and fallen dead, and then reappear, they are gone with a *flash*.
"A psychopath is a specialist in manipulating other people's emotions: buying weapons, international aid, and also domestic politics. While the psychopaths gather themselves in the ruins, in the great city of Revachol..."
"I don't know. I'm not a doctor. Look at me, who's doing the doctor's job. Not a lot of doctors around here. Probably because people don't want to *look* at their own bodies. The radist's got some radaway, I bet he does."
"They're a union of centre-left and centre-right parties across the reál belt. Our Coalition Government is just one of its many projects. They also run the ICP, EPIS... most inter-governmental organizations in the world."
The lieutenant nods. "And the -" he waves his hand. "I won't mention the -" he waves his hand. "I won't even mention the *victim* -- who I always thought was just a fiction fictional character, he's definitely not real."
"Oh, sweetie..." your companion says with a smile. "A very well executed plot, involving some quite lovely and bizarre characters. Even better than *your* own name -- because I think I can already call you *my* friend."
"It sounds like you're trying to *treat* yourself with a little *fun*. Like the *fun* of a little *pissing*." He sighs. "You'd do well to be careful. Fun is a *danger* to the state. Now, it's been an interesting week."
"I'm sorry, dear -- you've had to drudge through them so many times. Such is field work -- a young child, blind as the sun of poverty, heading towards the horizon with her hopes of one day climbing out of this world."
"That's a reasonable sum, not too small or unruly, nor too large. My investment does not need to come with house prices, or townspeople. And I have no *hold* on the RCM, because this incident did not involve the RCM."
He hands the tape a careful look. "You should play it on another player -- like a boombox or something. Don't worry, all the other spooks will be in the bushes by then, but you, you know? We'll take care of the rest."
The Doomed Commercial Area sits on the fjord, with its five or six hundred cars disgorging into the open water. The four or five thousand small houses built there are either derelict buildings or unrecognisable ruins.
"Oh yes, the coast, the mountains, the forests... it's beautiful and mysterious and scary. And it's all very *special* for me. But... no one knows exactly what happened to it. I just know we're not going to find it."
You could say it is a *major* event. A giant* mistake. And it *is* an awful one, in that there are *four or five more bullets before he leaves the room. The lieutenant is going to have to kill someone *on the field.*
"Okay. That's one good. I guess it's not a big loss to her either." He pauses for a moment. "The *bad* thing is that I *know* it's her handwriting. But it's not good enough that she has given me a place, or to her."
"We're on the same street." He points to the modish-looking building across the bay. "We've been here for years. This place has been around for nearly a century. I wouldn't *believe* the Queen was around here long."
"You'll find the filament memory with the off-site copy in the frozen ice cream maker. Please take it home ASAP, it's important. I'd do it myself if I lived in a civilized place with a freezer. Take care, Sulisław."
"Hey, there, you've got a *you* with a gun. A gun to your heart. A gun in your hand." He points at his hat. "You're a cop. I'm not going to go around hunting around with this gun. I'm going to hunt around with it."
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm just... there are lots of people and it's hot. And even if this isn't the end of my business, I can't do anything but this girl." He looks to the building behind him. "It's only the beginning."
"Yeah, like you don't have enough on your plate! Think of the other guys out there, getting their pipes torn up and their bodies pumped..." She looks around. "I'm one of them. I help them. I'm not gonna let you..."
"Look..." she looks around and lowers her voice. "There's no reason to be scared. We have a murder case on our hands, and this city is not going to be... well, we're not going to turn the lights back on just yet."
He smirks. "We were just standing around by the gates waiting for him to come back, watching him put the fire out before he got back. I don't understand what's happening. It sounds like he's manipulating someone."
"I don't know. There was something they wanted to do there. Gotta get the young man who's next to Garte on the island. And they wanted to make sure it couldn't happen again. So they brought the death squad down."
"That's it then. Thank you for the input. I will connect you to the 46th Precinct, just to make sure we have it in our car. Over." The woman ends the call and the lieutenant is left wondering where this is going.
The South Korean government is on the brink of a major rethink about the country's nuclear deterrent, with the country's prime minister reportedly contemplating a policy of "self-defence against imminent attack".
The woman on the boat cannot be more than seventeen. Nineteen. Then an Air Force captain named *Sulisław* Kukuszewicz was on the case. He was an extremely smart cop, and almost entirely disconnected from reality.
"It's a *ninth* revision. Some of the alterations are visible on the facade, but there's also a new, bold logo on the building's façade. It's the same design as the one used for the now-defunct Cuno's Handyman."
"One of them got downright suicidal. Getting drunk, violent, a little rapey..." He shakes his head. "Even their own negotiator couldn't control him. That's your boy -- the one who likes *hanging out* and trees."
"Yes. It's a youth centre and I have children. Got to give them *something* else to do. They're cute and small now, but they're growing up fast. I had my first drink when I was eleven, because I was so bored..."
(Gesture toward the trash container.) "The one we were supposed to deliver the key to? You think that, detective? There's some money behind this. He's making sure that we don't get out for another month anyway."
"Yeah, the two-and-a-half-metre tall Sidewinder from the officer's turn. And the big one," he points at the blonde, "Sawed that thing down at the annual inspection. It was a Sidewinder from the officer's turn."
It's a late fall afternoon in the old city, and the air in the reception room is funky with the smell of burnt cigarettes. You hear the ringing of keys on the kitchen table, as it ripples through the corridors.

"You could say so. Both houses were built at the same time and under the East Delta Commerce Centre project. That explains why you can call the Whirling from the intercom, albeit I doubt that anyone responds."
"It's a *vital* component of the body. It's vital for food and for oxygen flow. The liver is the largest organ in the body, and the liver is the most important organ in the body. It's probably a *boule* too."
"That's very nice of you. If you had more to say, you'd say something *in-depth*. It's just that *all* we know is, you were on an expedition in the Amazon. That was why they called it an *unnamed* expedition.
The reserved seating plan is actually a *form* of capital that allows for a disproportionate amount of income to be shared between private renters and the privileged. It's most commonly seen in Revachol West.
"It's not going to be a big deal. It's a *droplet*," he says. "You guys keep them around for their *pale*, when they don't have a scientific name. But that's not all. It also has the same *cautionary* side."
"Well, if it hadn't been for my fat, mean ass I probably wouldn't have answered that question. What perhaps is more ironic is that I haven't considered your involvement -- or even my involvement with Fatty."
"It was definitely male. The females don't need males to reproduce. In a wild species it's common for both sexes to mate. But in a lab with *one* male and a single female it's so rare as to *never* happen."
"My god..." Her eyes grow wide. "I've told you he's a bright young man here to pursue his education. Education is the foundation of our future, especially the arts. It is a cornerstone of our civilization."
"The sun came up, the world was blind, it was neon for about half an hour. Half an hour. The doors appeared to be lifeless in that time, as they had no doors at all. It was as bright as day. I waited here."
"You're right, officer." She smiles warmly. "I've always believed in the importance of good communication. And I've always trusted my own eyes. But maybe... you *don't* need to go to my Kineema, after all."
"You're right. One of them worked for the Union, the other for themselves. But they also employ people such as myself, the law and the public. I have to ask: do you serve them, or do you just *vieux* them?"
"No, we're not *just* interested in the history of disco, we're *real*... thinkers who look at things through the prism of proto-Semitism, who ask questions like: * Who's the first* or *Who's the bigger*?"
"Poor... this is the most tragic thing you've ever seen, is it not? A hundred years of history... You're a master for the ages, Harry. I'm sorry you had to see it, but let's just concentrate on the facts."
"Why not? There will always be another generation of hard core. They will be harder to work with. And just like me, they will be more *extra* beautiful. But maybe your gender doesn't define your humanity."
"Yeah, kid, what would I do with these supermodel glasses if I were you? Certainly not *spooky* them, but in their own way *weirder*..." He points to his glasses. "It's not the *Semwee* who invented them."
"Don't worry. The bad thing is you can't get out. There's nobody else looking for you. Your only options are sex, alcohol, and death." He looks at the dead man. There's a pause. "Death, sex, and alcohol."
"And the woman goes like..." She points at the air with her sharp-nailed finger, picking out an imaginary tattoo-star, "like a look of a *star* -- with the dark shadow of the Edmundоm Floating. Strange."
"I'm sure they're convinced that they're the sworn servants of the Redeemed Revacholian Revacholian Empire, and that they must always be on the look-out for the hand-me-down Makarrais-issued M9 pistols."
"You said you just talked to *your* neighbor -- who was actually just an old man. I don't even know how to read between these lines. We should do our best to make this as brief as possible, Ms. Du Bois."
"What do you want to know?" He takes a drag of his cigarette and smiles. "I'm sure it will be interesting. Don't worry, though -- that's the kind of fun we all have. This is all just a little... *fun*."
A small blue-grey meadow of slush comes up from the water. It looks like marshmallows -- one patchy and brand new, making grisly projections on the rest of the world while you're investigating a death."
"I don't know, Cuno," he shakes his head. "He didn't scream, he just looked at me. I'm just your *mate* and we bonded over the fight. If we go out, if we meet, if he comes *back*... thank you so much."
"The city is the harbour. It's a *centre-right* symbol for the future. In the middle of the harbour -- the harbour itself. That's why it has been interpreted so much as a metaphor for the whole world."
"What is," the shopkeeper looks up from her desk. "The RCM is a self-managing organization that operates on donations. We promote our own leaders. It would be like striking against your own... mother."
I am a little relieved to hear you want nothing to do with me... But it's okay if you lose it. That's what I tell you: keep up after you reach level 30. I'll be on the phone with you on time next time.
It looks like he doesn't have the use you'd expect of him when he's drunk. It tells you you that's all his *good* and that you're not in your face when a good man like you sing or dance or get angry...
The man's eyes widen. "That's pretty funny, but the thing is..." he seems to be watching you. "It's not even *the* *picture* of an idiot you're looking at. It's the other one. This one went *wrong*..."
"I'm not sure -- but it's damn difficult to catch anyway. It's just a weird dream I've had since winter's solstice. The most peaceful, the most pleasant, the most rewarding, hasn't even been possible.
"It was a good shot, though." He looks at the bullet hole in the wooden door. "I think I got the hang of that. The gun is likely to be a good one. Anyway, I'm not really *interested* in these people."
"No, Harry. Not as such. I would say that you're recovering from a recent medical episode, yes. You kept staring into the mirror -- and I know why. Because you *want* to be the 'bad' version of that."
"Cuno's got this," the boy lights up. "Cuno's got this. Easy, can't be too careful, but be careful. Caesium builds up in the glass and then breaks it. This makes it easy to break things in the dark."
"He said the real name was *Fred* and his brother, Fred-Friel. They were made into super-soldiers by their mother. There was a terrible accident at the hands of a drunk and the family was destroyed."
"I haven't seen him for... Well, to hell with it." She smiles. "Hell, let's just not talk about that. What if I don't want to talk about *that*? I don't need to know that shit. I'm a police officer."
"No. It's a coincidence. Cobo, the boxer, came here, looked like he wanted to beat the shit out of me. So I shot him. Prismatic, way out in the open. In the fuckin' spring. That's how I remember it."
"She was a mental patient who was admitted to the hospital. I know my name. If you see me, I'm gonna call her. Or we should call her, just for the sake of her... The worst thing is that they'll never
"The sun is in. I feel like it's *unexpectedly* late. A week ago I was on duty, at 8.30 pm. The clock reads 20.30. There's no time to do anything -- it hasn't opened yet. I should sleep by myself..."
"Also, hint: Lobs first and then they will go on to *finish* the other one. But we're such short-term managing directors that we make decisions based on *months* instead, perhaps months of nothing."
"Why? It's not like it's *not* going to get any better. This is just like... a hairdresser's nightmare. She's literally in awe of this man-thing. Every time he touches something, she's better at it.
It's possible for an officer to make an arrest *without* a warrant. You just have to ask, then let him know. Once your friend has spoken, your words seem to vanish, leaving you alone with the man...
The lieutenant lowers his voice. "He's been a hard-ass man for the past two decades, but he's done the proper work to secure the neighbourhood. He also *wants* to make Martinaise a *police utopia*."
"I was in the shower and he was playing a part of *some* water damage right in the stall door. He won't be the first person... I've been doing this long enough. I can't see him breathing." A pause.
"If you say so, officer -- if you say so." The big man twirls his moustache around the fire. "I'm clear it's none of the business of mine. My partner and I have a responsibility to uphold the law."
"No need for that," the lieutenant says. "The apartment I'm using for this is right next to the apartment you rented. *Just* wanted to make sure -- it's also right next to the door to the balcony."
"Playing fetch is an expression of frustration with the situation, not a sign of strength. Hand-outs are arbitrary. I'm not even considering the amount of times I've had to give one to a stranger."
"The big breakthrough was when he got himself cured of it. Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking of *the moon* -- we're talking about the *dearest, most beautiful, most important thing in the world*."
"The problem for Englishmen is that their 'life' is taken as a virtue and not an end in itself." It hits you now. "Still, I can't deny that it's a fascinating story to tell. Let's keep it, though."
"Yeah, who's the *crazy* one? That one? It *was* crazy in the head. But then again, I've only known this person for a few days now. We've only been in the Doomed Commercial Area a couple of hours."
"A few weeks ago this place was booming with activity. There were some sold-out shows. Of course, I wouldn't leave out a *permanent* place in the musical history of the world. I'm more than a *per
"Aww, c'mon now..." She's gotten a little defensive. "I don't actually mean to take that away from you, Harry -- I just think you and your colleagues have found it to be a bit... *too* hard core."
"I can see that you're not the most *technical* person around here. But that's not your fault. You're still a cop -- *if* you want to be a detective. You might as well be a *technical* detective."
"I'm afraid I can't help you with this one, officer." The shopkeeper looks at you asking. "It's mostly just a greeting. A slogan and a wish. I don't have anything to tell you about the dead body."
"It's okay, René, I can help you out." He looks you squarely in the eye: "Here are your options: You can either take the case, which is on-going, or you can go to the station. I'll take the case."
"No, this is not important, for example, it's important for the GM to know who's winning. What happens is, if you lose, the GM loses... what do you do? It's not *theory* you need to understand..."
"Swiped three cans of this blue medicinal stuff from the back room. Threw the snakes out and voilà -- what's left is this beautiful blue stuff." He shakes the bottle. "98.7%, almost pure alcohol."
"The eyes are a fact of life -- we are all capable of being either the most beautiful on Earth or the most beautiful in the Universe." Her voice is almost gentle. "We just need to play with them."
"The eyes are a fact of life -- we are all capable of being either the most beautiful on Earth or the most beautiful in the Universe." Her voice is almost gentle. "We just need to play with them."
"Very clever, officer." He looks down at the page. "It's not *carnal biter* material they're looking for, it's *futile* material *like* that, I will add. Crooked tweezers and drug trade material."
"Yes, we do. A postillion! But that doesn't mean a single one of them didn't," the man makes air quotes, "and that doesn't leave any room for any guessing or guessing while we're on this subject."
"Yes. It's not like other animals. I've known this my whole life. And I know what you mean. But --" he raises his hand to his eyes, focusing on the negatives. "You're not actually *neurological*."
"A fine example you are setting here today." He glances at the building. "I will write it down in my report. And I'm sure that the local shops have a lot of things to contribute to the recovery."
"I'm not really here, or anywhere -- hell, I'm not even sure how to get in the building -- it's all completely shut down now. Not *any more* than it used to be." Her expression changes instantly.
"It wasn't me. We just went out drinking after the [kidnap them. Leave.] We had our fun, Harry. We all do now," he closes the note, shaking hands and wishing him luck, "how does the *hurt* feel?"
"It's a -1 to all of your skills, detective." He inspects the man. "Be a good student, sir. You don't have to have the *clues* to build it. The clues are in the words. The clues are in the man."
"It's a code name for the Coppolino. It's a cooperative project between a local firm, the Coppolino family, and a few foreign investors. The project was awarded the 'Helix' award in the '19'..."
"It's not a *high* quality recording, officer. I'm not a die-hard audio engineer, but I could certainly understand the flow of the music. It's just a matter of understanding the song structure."
"No!" The old man in the corner says, his voice sounding almost incredulous. "Sure doesn't sound like you're an anarchist. They are better off just calling themselves the *Revolutionary* party."
"We have a *murder* to solve, and yet you go around asking everyone about money. And every time I ask, 'Are you sure? Can you see the phasmid in its lair?' They tell me, 'Sure, mom, it's real.'"
Use your powers of deduction! You knew the bug was nowhere near here. The phasmid is impairing your judgement. You'll have to return to this later -- you don't need to forget what happened here.
"A police officer from Revachol West? That's not *technically* possible. I can't be sure, but..." He looks around. "I will try to get a picture of the entrance. At least you remember the name."
"I should be *ready* for a lynching, you see. The guy in the shack. Already on that list of things I wish would be *more* difficult -- running up the back garden fence in the middle of winter."
"I was in mourning for my father, my mother was with me..." His eyes are distant. "I don't want to think about it any more. It was my father who was killed -- by the hand of his own brother..."
"They're all shit. Like me and you. All the people that live here and don't go to school, the people with no education, the people who go to labour camps -- they're all shit. They're all shit."
"Yeah, *Tis true*. Two hundred years of history, experiential and cultural -- it's all part of the same human experience." He taps on his foot. "It's the thing that brought the world together."
"Yeah, *Tis true*. Two hundred years of history, experiential and cultural -- it's all part of the same human experience." He taps on his foot. "It's the thing that brought the world together."
"You should get yourself together." He shrugs. "We are in a war zone, but at least it's over. We're not in a *long* war. I don't care what you do in the jungle. I don't care about your people."
The light has dimmed. The image is of the chimney rising. She looks at you and sighs. "But she left me three children -- none of whom are more important than the four brothers she left behind."
"He liked the way it *sounded* when he said it. We got it from a song. Yet there's something in me. A darkness, a gloom, even. I can't really tell you what it is. I'm trying to *memorize* it."
"It's probably a dead end," he replies. "But I did shoot it, right? Two points to that. First, it came from a different place. Second -- what I didn't think was a dead end, but a dead bullet."
"Let's face it, officer," the man says calmly. "There's been no shortage of drugs in the RCM's history. We've had tons of fun. But now..." He looks around and adds: "Really? Only one is left."
"Of course not." He immediately knows what is going on. "And I don't know about the murder. That was my problem -- not having a murder weapon. That's what made me say it. That was my *guess*."
"Some people think a weapon is a good reason to threaten people. Those people are *wrong* again!" He looks towards the doorway, then you. "We're all just pawns in your game of finger-pistols."
"Yeah, that's what Cuno likes to do. Get the fuck out of here." He punches the air again. "Get the fuck out of here. This isn't a *free* night. Cuno's paying for a room. Get out of this shit!"
"I've got it. I'm not going to try to use it. I'm going to *not* use it. This doesn't sound like the kind of place we need to take a look at. It's not the kind of place where we should look."
"I've got it. I'm not going to try to use it. I'm going to *not* use it. This doesn't sound like the kind of place we need to take a look at. It's not the kind of place where we should look."
"Yes, cop, that's one way of putting it -- he stole it from a bum, like you said. But that's not important right now. What matters is that the FOUR-TON MANTIS has been returned to his owner."
The man looks at you standing there, in the apricot-coloured light of the window. His wife is standing right next to him, holding a small bottle. Not a lot of people are present at this hour.
"I wouldn't go that far. She's just a local legend. A couple days ago the local children found her walking on the beach with a bottle in her hand. Apparently she was trying to impress them."
"It was, it was for the police." The boy repeats his story. "She came to the station every Sunday to take a shower. It was a job that I took for a few nights, and we had a couple of fights."
"The *before* might be a *before*..." He raises his finger. "A pre-revolutionary one, a *before* the Revolution. The Revolution of Revachol. Anything before that is a pre-revolutionary era."
"The locals are *alive* and (as far as they know) my father is a giant, but they don't know about his *alien* bloodline. That's why they thought I was a freak and I was scared of my father."
"Because it was the last thing he will ever do. This he has said he'll do it. *This*, he's scared now..." She whispers: "Please let it go. I don't want to hear another one about his pants."
"But when it was all over I was a better man." He looks around. "It was the worst thing that could have happened to me. I worked so hard to get here, but it was all just a *sham* for me..."
"Ha, so you *are* their finest. If you were to lie about that -- about *anything* -- about anyone, they would find you out. They have already started looking for the holes in the *näkkki*."
"You're right. I'm just an old man who's been breathing in this air for the last fifty years. I'm old enough to know what it's like to be alive, but I'm not old enough to know what to say."
"*Or* we could talk to the representative of the logistics company again. I know we already met Joyce, but that didn't count as an interview. We need to ask her where's the off-site copy."
"But you know where he *is*. And you know how they are -- everyone around here knows that guy. He's a little weird, but everyone here knows that he's a little weird. He doesn't talk much."
"I know you're gonna do it, pig. I know you're gonna do it -- I'm gonna put you on the bench and let you do it. I don't know why I did it, but I know what the lieutenant's gonna do to us."
"No." The lieutenant leans back, and says something to himself. "If there are signs of a beatdown, I'm investigating. You can come back when you're done with rounds -- if nothing happens."
"Over there," he points to the sea, "it's very cold. They don't advertise it as much as they advertise the drugs. It's really hard to get the same level of the drugs from any other place."
"I was thinking I could go in and take a look around, then come back here," he looks around. "I'm going to head over to the harbour and see if the harbour's got anything to do with this."
"I was thinking I could go in and take a look around, then come back here," he looks around. "I'm going to head over to the harbour and see if the harbour's got anything to do with this."
"No, just for the room -- and the broken window -- and the dripping water. This is during the day, there is no room for a slept man in this house. At least for the people who work there."
"Okay, I am going to make a deal with you. Some of these nuts are going to do what Cuno *wants* Cuno to do. *Then* Cuno will do what Cuno wants. Cuno just *won't* fit out of Cuno's hole."
"The fuck *did* they call the law firm?" He turns to you. "If you know what I mean, they asked... maybe the *faggot* can give you an *advice* to leave your job. Let's keep it that way..."
"Yes, since the dawn of time, the sea has been here -- the ocean, the lake... these are the last remnants of the sea. So what? You're just going to keep falling farther and farther back."
"I have a postcard covering it, instructing me about info on the camp. I'll send the info to you as soon as possible. Once you have the info -- if you want to do it -- get back to me..."
"It was a little over six months ago that a young woman named Phaedra appeared in this very church with the sound of her heart beating. For the past 16 years we have been following her."
"No, you're not!" The lieutenant is silent. He has his hand on his holster. "I would never do something like that. The same thing goes for you. You're a cop. You're not just going to..."
"Of course -- the antiques shop. But even I know the place is more like a nightclub than an antique store. It's a closed circuit-bender, and its patrons are usually on the *elite* side."
"Yeah, sure, if you're interested. In what is essentially a bloodletting. You've got something *broken* just like this one. But you also have something *unsatiable* and *unrealistic*..."
From everywhere above in the darkness: The proof of your action, the testimonial of your trust, the impenetrable allure of your chums, and even the fat man breathing up around your neck.
"I'll leave you to it, then. I'm not the only one who cares about your clothes, I've been following your every step and seeing you for who you are. It's been a... challenging few days."
"It's a message to the people you are trying to convince of their misplaced faith in you." She draws out the word. "The goons are going to piss themselves, they're not going to listen."
"It's not 'funk' or 'hard core' in a rap-styled sense. I prefer to think of myself as a classical melodicist, a true artist of the future, capable of capturing the universal aesthetic."
"It's not *unusual*. It's a lot like how I saw you." He makes a finger pointing motion. "Now I am a policeman. I'm not going to *sire* a new generation of stars, however I can help it."
"Wait, a man?" The woman stands in the darkness, looking down at you. "Can I just call someone like she did? I thought we had something in there." *Sylvie* is ringing around the window.
"Yes." He takes the tape player out from the box, and hands it back to you. "And with your permission I will show you some of the other ways I *could* use your gun." He watches the tape
He doesn't have to say all this. She didn't *want you* to be the most *unhinged* cop in Martinaise. Not this time. That's it. No *welcome*. She must die alone, at the *end of her days*.
It all seems very modern, futuristic, and *incredibly* cool, especially in the Evangelical Church building. While in truth there's nothing *modern* about it. It's a shelter. And a tomb.
"I designed the traps to self-destruction -- to protect myself from an apocalyptic industry. No," he gestures toward himself, "I did not create them *with* prostitutes or any of that."
"No, I don't know..." He looks at the woman. "I might have been wrong -- there are some women out there, but they don't know how to do anything. I mean that's the way it is right now."
"No, this is *absolute* shit!" (Point to your head.) "This isn't a real police officer. This isn't a real police officer! You're not a real police officer. You're a fucking *SUSPECT*!"
"Not to worry. The next phase would be making this *better*. The plan would be: find new parts for the ship, like the ones we have available here." He points to the ship's hangar deck.
"The smell gas? The smell of death? That's what the enemies of humanity have been aiming for, huh?" He goes silent, his gaze fixed on the last of the three hundred people in the world.
"We don't always get to have *funny with* what's going on here, but we have some ideas about how *real* this case is, that we're able to convince ourselves of, yes." He glances at you.
"And I... er..." She leans closer, then bites her lip. "It's good to have you back. I know you're not happy about this, but it's really not your fault -- it's someone else's fault..."
"Is it?" She looks around. "I'm not sure we're the only ones who know about the others. Or is it just me? I can't really... *let* them in there, I just need to check *officer* doors."
"It's a gigantic statue of the *imperium*. It's been up there since about A.D. 60 or so. It's a shame that the sun doesn't shine on it, but it's part of the *para-natural* landscape."
"No, he didn't -- he's not talking about this! He's just gonna keep saying whatever it is -- and you know what is going to happen when he does -- you're gonna get one of them killed."
"She's the mate of a big gangster. And she knows how to take care of that shit. She's got that *and*..." He takes a drag of his cigarette, then adds: "It's for the poor of the earth."
"Yes. I know who you mean. The ones who are in the habit of climbing onto roofs. At night, when it's clear that the building hasn't failed. They climb onto the roof. Like a spider..."
"You know..." Her eyes narrow. "While they were bearing down on the day of the lynching, the Union picked up some sticks and started prancing around, err, holding the lynching scene."
"*Was* magnificent almost, but not quite -- as he was too heavy for us to fit him inside the armoured harness. Our men felt the same lack of trust in him as they felt in you and me."
"Ah, it's good to see you, officer." She smiles. "I appreciate your concern. I understand the situation -- I've been through there myself. It doesn't look like it can get any worse."
"Fucking *hippy*!" He lets out a sharp laugh. "I am one of the most laid back people you've ever met in your life. I'm not going to try to convince you of anything, just let you go."
"He's a very, *very* busy man who rarely gets left for more than two days. Besides, he's a *mad* man -- who says 'f****t' every four years on the job. That's how he got where he is."
"I didn't." She takes a sip of her coffee. "There's nothing more awkward than being unable to recall something -- ever. So I chose to be by the book, if that's what you're implying."
"I don't know how many of them there are? I don't even know how many people are there in Revachol West. In Revachol West, there are *eight* of them and you haven't seen any of them!"
"No, I'm not." The man before you is naked, but for a pair of underpants and enameled boots. His skin is greenish, marbled with decaying veins and blotched from kicking the pavement.
"Not yet, but *I* will... when we've finished with this job." He looks at you, then the wind. "If we can make that much sense of the world's most powerful law enforcement officer..."
"Oh my god!" Her eyes grow wide. "My toes, they touch! I don't know, like, a newbie sometimes has problems with the way he covers them! But that's not you. You go in and touch them!"
"The Boreal Forest is a vast, vast world..." She looks around in the yard. "The Boreal Forest is not just about the *fantastique* it's also a vast, vast *entirely new* carbon cycle."
"The RCM is a police force created by the autonomous people of Revachol to provide law and order in the Western Cape. It is also, like, the *most* corrupt police force in the world."
"There's a documentary about people from another time -- yes. a person from a different era -- and it's called 'People of the Bridge.' I found it in the archives..." He looks around.
"Yes." She takes a drag of her cigarette, staring contemplatively at the corporal. "Whatever he tells us, we have to believe him. Even though we don't know what he's saying exactly."
FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS FUCK THE COPS 
That's the beauty of a *sociable* cop -- they can blend into the background, if you want. The guy is an intellectual property owner already. You can do some shady things if you want.
The little box that clings to the handle does not seem bothered by the wind outside. The case against it is weak, yes. But still -- it does *not* look like it was used in a homicide.
"Fuck you, Cuno!" The man's voice is still annoyed and cold, as though it's an insult. "Fuck you're gonna get in trouble with Cuno's dad. Cuno's gonna go to Cuno's dad's funeral..."
"I know, I know..." The man on the balcony looks at you, obviously confused. "But where's the password? I've been able to get to the server side of the house, but you're not there."
"I'm sorry, officer!" She looks around, then shakes her fist. "I was hoping you'd realize that I'm not really a doctor, and that you should treat the wound like a *medical* matter."
"It's a drug, a combination of cocaine and amphetamines. It's a *cocaine* syphilitic. Of course, it's not *cannabis* -- that would be a shit-house, but hey, better late than never."
"It's true -- Rene, the old guy, some other guy maybe. People have this *mutually beneficial* effect. But I hadn't seen the lorries much, just the occasional *drunk* pushing thing."
"No, I'm the *master of Ceremonies*. It's all the things. My forehead, my smile, my *big dick*..." He gets an angry gleam in his eyes. "I'm a fantastic guy. I enjoy the hard stuff."
"No, we're not," the lieutenant rushes in to say. "There is no evidence to suggest that this man was connected to the lynching -- or that we're dealing with a sequence killer here."
"What you're talking about is: the house! The house! The house is *beyond* the karaoke stage. You guys have lost it, you're just losing it on the other side of the fence, you know."
"You're right, my friend, but I don't know how to *fix* a thing like this. You should consult the book shop, or ask your questions -- we're not the first ones to ask our questions."
As he goes through the lengthy list of references, he notices the presence of a new e-mail address, and a new number -- 0438-039-80 -- written in *not* a font of his earlier selves.
As he goes through the lengthy list of references, he notices the presence of a new e-mail address, and a new number -- 0438-039-80 -- written in *not* a font of his earlier selves.
I hate to tell you, but it *really* isn't. There's nothing *you* can do. No *revelation*. No *purification*. Just regular people at their jobs. Drinking their brains out. Giving up.
"I found a library card from his pockets, but I haven't read any of it. We went around the Whirling looking for the same thing -- I thought we had our answer, but it wasn't there."
"The *big tent* has been a shithole. No people, no place to farm, no reason to get shit done. Just *shithouses*... and we can't even evict them, because there are simply too many."
"We only have a cursive knowledge of their life and the accident exactly -- if we even know it was the crane, then it's too late for you..." She appears to mull it over in silence.
"Yeah, fucko. You didn't deserve that, but I did." His hand is covered in bruises. "I fucked around, picked the ass of several drunken ass-lickers and now I'm..." His mouth watery.
"You told me the wrong serial number." The lieutenant grows very still. "Why would you do that? Why would you jeopardize your own crime scene? And now the boots are gone, too. This
"Don't be asking, they wouldn't listen to me." She crosses her arms. "This place is *famed*, my people. They don't talk about their *enemies* there. They don't go to the islands."
"Just to be else upfront: it would have been *really* compromising for him. You, I -- this woman -- and then there's the pistol -- would have to prove our entire thing right now."
"No matter what I've said, Idiot Doom has not budged. We are prepared to take the *next* step forward. We have it all -- this district, the bay, the city -- and then an overdose."
"The harvest of this year has mostly been gathered in the Lower Less-Lands, though -- by the time we reach the terminal we've already seen the damage to our progress in the form."
"Well, at least the artists who were going for those pieces got their shit together and didn't just lose their nerve. Anyway, I have to hand it to them, for the artistic licence."
"Yeah, you don't like them either, do you?" She nods. "You've got the right to wear whatever you want even if it's a stolen pistol. That's your right -- it's not a *cop* right..."
"Yes, I can see that." The lieutenant looks at the staircase. "It was done by the hands of a skilled artisan. And a good one at that. It really did look like a *branner* to me..."
"But what IS it?" She looks at you quizzically. "As long as you don't touch it -- you don't even *jail* yourself. You just get a little stinking and a little shit in your pants."
"Okay. So what he's saying is... you know, some people get sad, and they go around apologizing for this and other things. And you know how most people do -- they don't like you."
"Yes. The arrest and the appearance of the phasmid -- the combined stress..." He looks down at his boots. "Maybe you thought we'd gone extinct. But we've got more to tell you..."
You could have died. Died *now*. Killed yourself in another spot. But you only have one choice -- to STILL DRINK. DRINK. Then you finish your beer, and the gun isn't even out..."
"I know, I know!" The cafeteria manager interrupts with a scratchy smile, but he's not looking at you. He's looking at the kitchen -- where he tries to make a *bare-bones* joke.
"Okay, I said *absolutely* not *knew* who put it there. Only thought it might chameleo-amorality, but who cares? I just got up around midnight, hell, I even shopped for lights."
"Yes, like a *mild* version of the *nervous* you get in a relationship. *A* little. Especially when you're not dating. But, if you don't wanna go back there, that's no problem."
"I'll find a drink (Get to know the place) later, thank you for telling me the news. In the meantime, let me know if there's anything else I can do for you, Fortress Accident."
"It's very *understandable* that the RCM feels I need to distance myself from the murder. And that it is my responsibility to *provide* assistance to the RCM in that capacity."
"That *was* happening when I shouldn't have. This is me putting myself in danger -- again, my biggest responsibility, and again, the part I haven't been paying attention to..."
"That is quite a lot of guns, Kim. I'm pretty sure that's the most we've ever seen in this place -- unless we count the *wompty-nompty* of the Kineema. That's a lot of guns..."
"The company has tried looking into the matter before -- to no avail -- and has failed to do so. It's not a *sport* for a man to take his family and then abuse that privilege."
Cocksuckers... Erect and bloodstained cock-arm. It's not like it has been anything but a bad day. And then there are the red legs, the sweat stains, the petals -- all familiar.
"Don't worry, everyone -- I *am* famous and shit and *was* woke up in the end and could *disguise* myself here." She smiles at you. "I'm a liar, you see -- I'm just a friend."
"Easy, Cuno!" The youth man is under the impression you're gonna fuck him to death for the lollipop. "Because it's not going to happen. You're gonna fuck yourself in the ass."
"He means -- before -- the trap. After -- the trap." She shakes her head. "I'm not *entirely* invested in it -- but she had a lot on her plate lately. And you helped her out."
"I got to thinking that she was *stupid* and wanted to have a nice conversation, then I realized she was just playing a bad case... so I'm not gonna have a nice conversation."
"I'm sorry, I'm not gonna say anything to you. I'm not gonna give you a goddamn drink, I'm gonna call the precinct and I'm gonna beat the shit out of your ears with my fists."
"I'm sure you absolutely *don't* want to know, but if you ever need to know, the RCM can be reached at..." He points to the building. "The building right behind the building."
"Indeed. Noid and his crew have been known to pull out their explosive devices to scare people." He looks to the gate. "But I think we should go, at least for the time being."
"No accusations of sexual indiscretions here." The lieutenant gives you a brief nod. "We do need to get the case back on track. I'll send you some information if you need it."
"Not many First-World people get to experience life outside their home countries, and maybe for a few of the guys in Martinaise, the rest of the trip will be a little easier."
"She and my husband are good people, I tell you that. We are good people who like our guns to have loads of bullets. Our bodies to be nice and clean. I'm not a *blood-hound*."
"This is a unique opportunity to win him over, officer. I honestly don't know what else to say. It's pretty bad right now. He has disabilities too. It's all I can do for him."
"Yeah but they got shot in the head -- in the mouth -- right there!" She's still looking for it, but doesn't find it. "The soldier went down fighting for his life -- bravely."
Not all of these people are your friends. Some are jealous of your influence. Some are afraid. All of this stuff just makes you *feel* your heart still pounding in your ear...
The man next to you blinks. "What, you think he's a member of your peones? He looks like one of your guys. Look," he points at the ceiling, "like another one of your buddies."
This is an excellent way to go - show them that you are very *scientific* and *supernatural* and in charge, and that your *weapon* will come to power *favorably* for everyone.
"No. I climbed the chain link across the water and hid inland. In the bunkers underground, like the weakest of the weak... a mouse. Frightened of the ordinance all the time."
...finally coming to an end with the bandana. You can feel the curve of his face -- that of a wolf. This is a powerful engine, needed to be restarted once to get out of this.
It doesn't look like she would ever use the RCM's emergency call box, but maybe she did? Maybe she didn't even know it was there, and she thought she could trick her way out?
Then she continues: "I think sometimes men with authority have their quirks, but usually they leave their mark. This is merely a facet of the Man from Hjelmdall's character."
You *think* you could get better, but you can't! It will never go away. It will just grow, like an unstoppable beast, *expanding*, *contracting*, *contracting* ever bigger...
"Ask him!" The street vendor turns around. "What makes you so sure about that? We've been here for days. That damned water lock is broken, and we can't go under the 8/81..."
"I'm glad you don't have to come back here all the time. We're all just here to watch the stars move around here... Nothing to do here? I'm going to let everything here be!"
"No I don't wanna! The fuck's she doing in his fridge? I don't even let my kids play in the woods. I can't even bring her back into this city. I don't wanna lose you again."
"You remain fugitives of the law. From the law. From life itself -- a city on the edge of the world. A prime, first-class example of how to make an impression on the world."
The water spouts a cloud of muck. The air turns to black powder -- a black sprawl of ground beneath you. The lieutenant is staring at something out of the corner of his eye.
This is the nightwatchman's booth. The name on the door reads *René Arnoux*. A colourful uniform lies neatly folded on the table. A curious blue tie is caught on the sleeve.
"A mouthful -- and what people like to call *collateral*. It *is* part of the corporate gumshoe business. You need it just to line the pockets and teach the kids a lesson."
"I see." She takes a drag of her cigarette. "And no, I'm not getting that. Too many other people got this, you know, reading this story, and I'm completely okay with that."
"I... I don't know what to say..." She looks at her hands. "But then I think of things again. And *pity* the girl she fell into. A girl she knew -- and just *melted* away."
"No, it didn't." The lieutenant looks at you. "We have to get him again, if you want to continue the joke. Maybe you can get a different one, depending on the time of day."
"The abolition of the death penalty is a long, long way away. What's happening now is the *final* step in that long process. We need to write it down as a law of the land."
"What's there about this guy?" The lieutenant puts his hand on the man's shoulders and smiles. "He's had his share of problems, but he's good at keeping his head together."
"I don't want to be dishonest with you, lieutenant. I'm so *axed out* I can't even call a store. But let me assure you, with some planning this one's for the *foodchain*."
"I got 70 real. Or should I say, I got *hundreds*." She looks at the note on the counter. "I don't need more money. Also, I don't need to be indebted to any shady people."
"I hear you have singled out a *persona*. Anonymous. Invisible. Semi-permeating. Know that we are vigilantes and you will be taken to task. Confiscate your lucre quickly."
"Joyce L. Messier. I represent the board of Wild Pines -- the owners of the harbour. You must be from the RCM..." She steps closer and holds out her hand over the railing.
"Oh, so you're saying I'm going to go find the *whore* here?" He reaches out his hands: "Don't worry, I'll find you. In the end, I'll *never* get in trouble with the law."
"The old man's a little impatient, but I'm not giving up on this. The sooner I get in there, the sooner I'll find out if I'm really, really, really, really... Fucking...."
"You're right -- I'm the last one on Earth. I *won't* stay with you." He looks to the door, waiting for his friend to say something else. They've left the key in his hand.
That's so true. She made a mistake there... she should have thought: "Oh no, there is no need to be direct." Instead of saying it's not her fault. It's her fault entirely.
The captain turns to your friend. "If there are any changes in the Harbour's *custom* for now I'm happy to assist. But if you know *where* I can help, I can help you too."
"But it's not just a matter of *pitying* the poor person, for example. It's a matter of *hunting* them down, and then bringing them back up. That's the heart of the law."
"During this time, the city shrank from coast to coast. Then came the first boom. Despair. And money in the city. For hundreds of years it didn't do even that much good."
"Ha, so you *are* their finest. Handsomest, most stylish, most fashionable. This is a serious weapon. Can't fault a man for wanting to impress his fellows. Very stylish."
"It's what she said, not me..." He looks to the old man. "But I know what it's like to be on the other end of the spectrum, with a severely degenerated every chromosome."
"The Filippian f****t is a disgusting pig. And I've never had a good dinner with him. But look at them now -- they're busted. Cuno's on the fucking edition of that book."
"The greater part of the empire is part of *the State Imperium*." He pauses. "And the State Imperium is part of the Empire. And the Empire is part of the State itself..."
"We're not giving anything to *him*. He can keep the gun -- or not." He holds out his hand in agreement. "Either way, we should be better for this. *One* day, I think..."
"Yes, there are things we can do -- we *can* find the cause of death. One of them needs to be in a *pale latitude* so we can take a look at it... at the lower-latitudes."
"You think? He's what -- eighty? Not so sure about that... I think he's near ninety... No, he's *really* good at getting old. I really can't get over the *ex-something*."
A series of crests, colours and colours, appearing on your soul's surface! You behold a rainbow of colours, a sea of beige and browns, far beneath the visible spectrum...
"As previously stated, a major hub for illegal motor vehicle activity across the strait-and-jacket. This may also explain the unusual nature of your transport system..."
"He praised me. I'm right next to the ocean, but I don't really see a board of governors..." He nods to his partner. "Run to the ocean for me, sir, just for a moment..."
"I know it's hard to admit you've done some things. I was like you once, just dragging my feet from one place to the next..." She looks down. "It's painful to remember."
"I'll pay you back tomorrow. Here's the money for the "Miracle on the Rio de Janeiro", check out the menu, so much better than the old version ("The New Generation")..."
"It's very hard core, that's what I'm saying." She shakes her head. "Hard core, yes -- and we can all be the part of its evolution at its peak! So you can say that too."
"Of course, Harry! Just know that this doesn't represent the RCM's view of things." (Turn to Kim.) "He has a wife and two children. The RCM condemns any such behaviour."
"Oh good." He doesn't sound like he's worried. "When you get the time, you could take another look at those tracks in the yard. See if they fit this band of miscreants."
"We don't know what you mean by *party*. We don't know what makes you think that a police officer is going to be anything but *fun* -- there's no such thing as *party*!"
"Well, the *boots* that were lying on the ground -- they're pretty thin, where you get them. Not easy to make out on closer inspection, light being on *here* and *not*!"
"Yeah..." The old man says quietly once you've got *everything* in. "You can't get the drugs off the street if you're a drug kingpin. You get the equipment. That's all."
"You know what? I don't even remember being a cop. I just remember two words: *lost gun*, and *lost gun*. Lost gun is a thing. A *thing*. I'm lost gun, I'm also lost..."
Feels good, doesn't it? You know what's more? You shouldn't be able to tell the difference. It's not a *disappointment*. It's not a *real* disappointment. Just bad luck.
Her hands are soft and her fingers slips from the dial. "We need to restore power before using it -- the prybar will help, but first we need to turn the lights back on."
"Boys, with *those* boots on, you're gonna be a rapper, 'bout that science shit he's *discovered*. Get the fuck out of here. You don't *need* to be a pig. That's lame."
"Fuck no, pig. Cuno ain't dealing to the popo. Not doing the pork pen for your sad speed habit! Not doing the pork pen for your sad speed habit! You don't *know* Cuno."
"I'm not a *symbolist*, Harry. I'm a realist. My statue will be Martinaise rebuilt: five story building complexes, kids off speed and landowners in Ozonne *hating* me."
"I'm not. This is a new name for a skin care product. And a consequent migration of the people who identify as wood -- into experience. Perhaps it's something natural."
"I'm sure the Isopagites have the technology. They build all this. This here." He points to the contraption on the side of the machine. "And they also have the skills."
"It's the most beautiful day of the year, when the sky is blue and the earth is filled with snow... I've been there, I've been sleeping there, and I'm back here now..."
"No one knows. Some say he stalks Martinaise to this day, and can be seen near the canal when the clock strikes midnight." He makes a spooky gesture with his free hand.
"This really has nothing to do with politics. You see, we've known each other for years. No one tells you *what* he would say -- bro. Lawman, you gotta stay out of it."
A cold wind sweeps up the fabric of the abandoned building, flapping open its doors and echoing in the apartments above. Despite the early spring the place is not warm.
"He didn't respect the sea. Went out there drunk like a skunk and sure enough one day the boat was found floating empty. The bloated corpse turned up two weeks later."
"I think I may have gotten a little too deep into the case, didn't I?" He takes a sip of tea. "But I'll try to get back to the good stuff. I was hoping it would help!"
"Ms. Kitsuragi." She makes a note. "Our partners want to sell us this stuff for business profit. It's no real treasure hunt, we're just going to have to deal with it."
"Yeah..." She looks back at the crumpled snow-cake the lieutenant had just devoured. "Maybe some of those reeds in the yard near the canal can try do it for you, huh?"
A familiar air of sadness envelops the room. Your heart is beating slowly. You feel it -- a let-down. It's the response of the man who was overjoyed to be knocked out.
He nods. "Only one, I know. My friend's a little eccentric, isn't he? He does odd things sometimes. Strange things. It's okay. Makes him unusual. But that's just him."
"*What* the fuck? You got one under the bar, down you have one under the heart -- you get one, you get the Cuno angry..." He rubs his temples. "Now what do you want?"
"But you see," he says slowly, savouring every word, "Cuno is just this cool, lightning-man kind of guy. Doesn't worry about no one. Cuno's just this emotional shit."
"Hmh..." The lieutenant is passively staring at you. "What does this old man know about the RCM? If he wanted to, he could have *informed* us. But there's no need..."
"Oh, I'm not afraid. This is all a part of me -- the *part of me* that is invisible, to all the world. All the other parts I have to work with -- all just disappear."
"Yes, a working class kid was hanged, you know." He looks around. "I don't know about the others. I just know about myself and my parents. That's how the story goes."
"You're right, lieutenant -- I don't." He turns to you. "You snorted the drugs, I know you did. It's all right, I mean, at this point -- *anything* is but the drink."
"You're wrong, you're wrong. I've gotten into every door and even into every apartment building -- it's all just to get the hell out of our way. Just to clear my head
"As of yesterday morning, Dilruk Wirrâl and Kedraan GVT are located in Jim's lovely neighborhood. I don't know where it went..." He pauses suddenly. "There really is
"I don't know..." He squints at it suspiciously. "It had the upright sticks of a soldier, with the regular clogs of a civilian. There's something in my imagination."
"I hear you have singled out a *suspect* and are in pursuit -- this is progress. However, we must locate *other* things first. There is only one solution to this..."
"I knew he was a communist!" He looks at you in disbelief. "Really? He didn't say anything? Cuno, I've seen communists twice how it's *done, so... why the fuck not?"
"Is that the road to - or to hell?" They smile. "She's the gecko lady, and she doesn't want me to go there. But it was ... *impossible* to convince him otherwise..."
"Of course not. I was just playing a role. Now..." He steps closer behind the plant-gazing Lintel desk. Your words do not reach her. You disappear from his memories.
"Oh yeah. It's a little like someone leaving his apartment in the morning and never waking up. You start looking around and realize you're not really alone anymore."
"The case itself was extremely poor. No documentation, nothing. Just stumbling in here. Can you believe it?" He looks over the edge. "You gotta wake that up, right?"
"Told you you *never* got to that church!" The lieutenant looks away. "Was obviously a bad omen for the scene that night, but what do the police do in the meantime?"
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scrub brushes -- you, your first love, Mr. Soldier of the Apocalypse here..."
He was groomed from five to six years old. His parents had to leave him in a school for the deaf children. He was an anglicent boy, the smallest of the six brothers.
It was not clear what this new breed was used for, but some of the other guys got distracted... you could *sense* it in you, though. She kept her hand on her pistol.
LORD COUCH, IT IS ALRIGHT AND PURE, AND PUTRIDO IN THE MIND. THROUGH THE MIRROR OF THE CIRCULATE SYSTEM, YOU WILL SEE ME THROUGH THE MIRROR OF THE CIRCULATE SYSTEM."
You hear a malevolent hiss over the loudspeaker. He's looking for a way to *inscribe* his tattoo onto the body of the victim. Once it's done, the hissing disappears.
"I bet I don't have to tell you about the woman who used to be my mother. She went off on her bike once, I can only imagine." He nods. "We had some tea together..."
"I found a wooden chair." He waddles over to the chair. "I think it has something to do with all the weird stuff I've been seeing. It's so weird it makes me dizzy."
"I was thinking *hard* about it, and it felt like *shit* -- you know what I mean. I threw it away. The ball was already up there; I shouldn't have thrown it there."
"It's like I'm a convicted murderer! You're not the highest authority in the neighbourhood, either! Not even a senior citizen can come up with anything *upstairs*."
"No, there are *degenerates* from Jamrock and other cities who are interested in that mould, who are looking for a haven from the rest of us. Who are these people?"
"The next time when you encounter a list of topics with numbers on it -- start with 1. Then 2. Then 3. Lists are numbered for a reason. It is the *intended* order."
"Yeah?" Titus mumbles, then looks at the old man in the doorway. "Yeah, we're both cops. It doesn't *anyway* make it less of a cop. Or a good cop, for that matter."
"You're right, man." She looks at you with a mixture of suspicion and understanding. "What do you care about the RCM anyway? You're not a cop, you're just a drunk."
At first it looked like something was out of place -- but when I saw my hand in the glovebox, it didn't look like a dead man... It looked like a dead man standing."
She takes a sip from her flask. "That's alright, dear. I don't want to see a dead woman talk about her dead husband... I don't want her to worry about it any more."
There is a little gap where the strap should go. It's not that the belt is going to snap, it's just going to hurt. You will have to *re-learn* from this, somehow...
"Aye, so here you are. And you're going to need a couple of hours." He nods toward the wooden-and-steel counter. "Alright, I found all the *bulk-buying* supplies."
"I'm sorry, I don't like the sound of that. But it's what it is -- an *actual* police report. All I can say is -- we're not going to bother the suspect with this."
"It looks like the insect had some kind of nest there -- look. Like a *crab castle* I think. But I can't be sure. I wouldn't know. I've never seen one in my life."
He rolls his eyes. "All right. Now back to the story. You know, this is *something* that you need to get straight. The whole world is watching, isn't it, officer?"
Rows of stalls under a broad roof, where silk and wool cling to the wooden planks. There are carts and rags, as well as a metal plaque on the side of the building.
That is the nightwatchman's booth. His name reads *Thérète de Saint-Ghislaine* -- *Captain* -- High above you, carrying a thin bundle of what remains of your life.
"Good." The lieutenant nods. "I'll tell you what I don't like about it. The metal loop you're using to hang the photo on is one I'm currently experimenting with."
"I don't know the legality of whatever the fuck they're doing. But it's no secret *and* everyone knows it. *And* we have the tools. *And* the men. They got that."
"I was looking for something tangible, and I found a piece of metal which made a ringing sound. Not a sound that I want to remember when I am in my... childhood."
"I've only heard a verbalized version of the story, but look..." he points to the light in his glasses. "It's perfectly pitchable, given the state of decay here."
"It's a miracle of carpentry. Dead bodies carved into *total* shapes. Every day there are new ones. Today, they're already in place. They're already *happening*."
"Just a normal day off. Light up, man! Watch that ass on the big dick --" He turns to Titus. "The point is, this *allegorical* Kim should've just told the truth."
"No. I *deduced* something. I'm a genius -- a regular *psychic* connoisseur of high-quality deception. I'm not even the slightest bit sceptical of their quality."
"That's *so* fucking weird... There are lots of that shit around. They even put it in a garbage bag, a small piece for example. Just look at it. I don't have it."
"There will be a hard-core, hard-core youth centre there." The lieutenant nods approvingly. "It will be like we never existed, with a million different speakers."
"Yes, that you do. I just wanted to point out that it's *not* like a police thing -- we don't have to defend ourselves against the prying eyes of the underworld."
The uniform clad man looks at you, then Gaston, and sighs: "No. I just wanna play pétangue with my partner here... Even though his music is so... unprofessional."
"I see you have taken a liking to his mug collection. There's little else to do here. The harbour is in maximum lockdown, everyone's on the go. Even the locals."
"I'd also suggest we also interview Joyce, the Wild Pines representative, but we've already done that. A quick note -- also found her to be forthcoming with us."
"It did not come up, I got lied to, I got played by. You guys want to make me *remember* all of it -- even though we've had our fair share of drinks and such..."
"It's the *Headless FALN Rider*. A headless man wearing a FALN tracksuit. Riding a horse. In search for the FALN cap that went missing -- when he lost his head."
"That's the problem we're all having. When you get this *far* you become a part of the *stupid* club. But you ARE a part of the club... you're part of the club."
"Yes. The way it *is* working -- I already have two arrests for you. But this is about the other thing. The one that you seem to be in the middle of. Your body."
That moment of hesitation may have been the reason why he's not carrying a weapon. The lieutenant thinks he's worth it -- and you doubt he could have made it up.
The sun is up and the rain is..." The lieutenant says it's a creech fire but makes a note of a cedar wood scent, a laundry detergent scent, like they're laundry.
"A series of coincidences, isn't it? Like we could right now hope to walk in a world made up of only one, *hell* of all, *murder* suspects. What do you expect?"
"Fucking... you get it! I didn't tell you any crazy shit, I just asked some of my pals here for some local tips. What, you needed some directions? Ask me here!"
"Okay, you wanted to know what I do?" He looks around. "I'm a *ninja* for the RCM, and I have a great connection to my own uniform. Anyway, I have my own plan."
"Pigs? What the fuck was that?" He waves his hand at the guy with the glasses. "What was there to say? I was just looking for a possible trigger for the event."
"The Insulindian phasmid -- that's not an insect, you don't know its legs or its antenna. This is a man..." He looks around. "Who's been out there -- recently?"
"Yeah -- no." The lieutenant shakes his head. "This is a matter for the internal disciplinary police. They take a look around and decide what the next step is."
"A new method of emission. A *magnetic* method. It's *super-magnetic*, *magnetic* enough that it should have taken place in the *Greater* Magnetic North-West."
"He's just gonna keep saying whores, f****ts, and cunts. Keep it up, Gilbert." The man smiles at his friend. "He's a real piece of work, this is what he does."
"I know about *narcotics* and *psychobiotics* and *antipsychotics* and... *some* other stuff. But this stuff is special, you know. I don't want to mention it."
"I was told that there's a representative for the Dockworkers' Union here." She points to the elevator doors in the corner. "I also saw him. He's a funny cop."
"Oh no, it's fine, officer. Some people are more perfectionist than others..." She smiles. "In the end, it's all about us. Nothing more. Nothing more perfect."
"You're no Roonie." The bald man shakes his head with impatience. "Just let her know she's not *being* herself -- I can't help that. Let's change the subject."
"You're right. The boys were arrogant. Of course they picked the most beautiful of them, but there was one nagging one... still, the boys were ambishanging..."
"You're saying this out loud. True. It's an understaffed station where too many cases have gone unsolved. In too many days. There are not enough cases solved."
It's here in the old port where you see the window that leads outside -- on B'Bloq. You're already there, watching over the natives as they contemplate murder.
The wind howls in the yard; towards the house a mausoleum of telecommunications towers erupts into view: Companies and families trading reciprocal information.
You've *disconnected* him from your "connection" too. When he left you. All those preparations and tests and manoeuvres you did for him -- to connect with him.
"Cuno knows that shit. That's why Cuno didn't want to fuck you. Too old, Cuno wasn't here -- needed a revamp. Cuno didn't want to corrupt your life, you see."
"He's on the island, eating bubblegum, chilling, right? I'm just a poor, homeless man, throwing up bubbles. He's on the island, eating bubblegum. Like a dog."
"The reconstructed Hunter is a low-profile *rare* military weapon. Most of the time it's shot from the roof, but I've heard there's been shot at a nightclub."
"The Warrant of Succession was issued by the Coalition Government to all the participating Localities; it's the successor of the previous Interim Government."
"Yeah, why aren't you fucking shitting yourselves -- what's wrong?!" He glares at the officers standing silently in the dark. The colour drains from his face.
"Yes, clearly." The lieutenant rubs his chin. "You've got a *low* threshold for fear. And a *high* threshold for pleasure. The next step is to scale it down."
"You know *very* little about the people you're supposed to protect. You just want to know *little* things -- about *little* things -- about *little* things!"
A lot of these *whores* are from *the north*, but you know how that goes -- *and* north -- if I could convince some of the old ones to keep the books there...
That strange sadness came over you too when you did not see it. The weight of the world was suddenly and undeniably heavy -- the shock was all you could take.
"Always a pleasure to see Cuno on the beat, bro." He speaks up. "When Cuno and C pick Cuno's knot, Cuno is gonna sacrifice big. You need a *little* bravery."
"Hey, at least you didn't fail. You've brought some useful tools with you. We can go and mail the watermark please. Just let me know so I don't waste a day."
"Just go ahead and say it again -- you haven't seen it since the day the world was one... before things got super fucked up. Like..." He leans his head back.
"Oh that?" He scratches his cheek. "I didn't think you'd remember anything. I'm not surprised that she's pulled before. I'm not surprised that she's scared."
"Something like that," he nods. "I'm not judging you. Many cops are actually doing their job. If you give them a chance -- give them another chance. Also..."
"Somewhere in the city center there was a door that led to a massive door -- a door that leads to the roof, to the roof. It had *another* door on it, too..."
"The major point is that this murder was not an isolated incident. The murder is part of a data breach. We know that. It's *probably* connected to the case."
"The man who was with me everywhere, there -- from my apartment, in the viaduct... It's... It's everywhere! It's everywhere! It's possible to be everywhere."
"We're close. And I can hear the footsteps downstairs. I know it's about to be *unceremonious*. I have absolutely no idea!" She shakes her head in her hands.
"What, no time? Don't even *have* to think about this shit... I already talked." The boy picks up the remote control, turns it on, and turns down the volume.
It's the same old woman you saw at the bookstand, only now her cheeks are reddish and her eyes smaller. A tuft of hair hangs from the middle of her forehead.
She nods. "I know it's hard to admit that you've got a problem. I was like you once -- couldn't take an honest look into my own heart and see I was in pain."
The lieutenant stands behind the fence -- watching over his little neighbourhood. He would rather not. It's like he's never met the girls in the first place.
"*You'll* fuck it off if you keep it. It's the curse." He's suddenly silent as the great seal of the church ripples around your hand, melting into its grip.
"I don't have to tell you, sir. The dead must be dealt with immediately, it's no longer a matter of *me*. It's an act of war on you. This was your mistake."
"I have great news for you..." He smiles gently. "It was passed on to me by a well-meaning recycler. It's not exactly mine -- but I do. For a lorry driver."
"I'm going to ask around to the store owners for the manager's information on this. We need to talk about the possible location of the bullet in your head."
"It's a thirty-millimetre shell fired from a cannon with a muzzle velocity of over 600 metres per second and an effective firing range in either direction."
"It's even *more* than that, though. It's a *multifaceted* approach to the same problem. In fact, I'd say it's a *multifaceted* approach to *normal* cases."
"No, you don't have a chance." He looks at the sea. "The rest of the coast is a closed system of sewers and storm drains. No one ever comes to investigate."
"No. They were not shot by the communists. They were shot by the communists. They were never even shot by the communists. They were shot by the communists."
"Not that we're privy to, but what do you think of the carabineers?" And then you see someone -- not *you*, but *him* -- with the insignia of the two gangs.
"Please don't misunderstand, either of us, we're terrifically inept as it is. It's not like we're wrong for bringing a faulty theory to a flawed detective."
"Right. So what you don't know is that the people who came to kill you were professional killers. They tortured you -- and you eventually died as a result."
"This *is* a really *bad* place for a man like you, Harry. If you'd like to try again, I'm sure you could. But I wouldn't recommend it, not yet at least..."
"You mean someone *stole* your badge, right?" She gazes at the chair. "*Someone* stole it from you. The chairs aren't worth it -- but I brought you anyway."
"You're mad, Harry. What did you want to know? Oh, I've been putting up with you. It's not like we're drowning in leads. We're drowning in our own blood..."
In the meantime, you're just like any other MAF forgotten *partition* of your life. But then again -- it's not really the fact that you forgot that matters.
It's clear even to you that these people would like to see the city burn without a fight -- even without their weapons drawn. They're afraid for their life.
The man in the middle looks at you, as if it's your severed head that's the only thing keeping your head together. Then he nods, shoulders slightly relaxed.
"And if you haven't noticed, I'm very serious. I am the police in these parts, trying to clean up the drug den that your partner helped me to investigate."
"We aren't cops. Are we? We don't *have* guns. That's the first thing people think when they get shot. Guns don't shoot people. So, what can I do you for?"
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scouter-fingers in the dark... it's not a good idea to wander off."
"Whooh, that's really old school." (Put your finger to your temple and exclaim.) "These people brought you even greater scrutiny -- and that was not good."
"Yeah, that's a good one." The guy smiles at you. "He's definitely a modernist. Like most urban anarchists. I mean, that's all there is... just what I am."
As the women go, Patrol Officer Minot looks back over her shoulder -- at the crumbling colossus there, casting a shadow on both the men and the building...
The lieutenant looks at the empty gun, then you, slowly. You don't understand what he's trying to *understand*, it's just *hearsal*, his brain tells him...
"Miss, we are investigating the murder of the man who was hanged." He looks down at the yard. "The people who put him there have asked us to talk to you."
"No, he didn't." The one with the necklace stares at you coldly. "You don't get to squeeze out every drop of us after keeping us in the dark for so long."
"Oh yeah, there's *nothing* wrong with that -- insane. That's how he does it. Crazy, Crazy Silver Balls. It's not some kind of disease, it's a cool name."
"Okay, I do... And not the best. And I do mean *good*. I did the thing I needed to do, I did the thing I would do. I don't know, to keep the ship afloat."
"The union of criminals is how these miscreants runs around offing citizens. I hope you're not supposed to *believe* that." He does not take it seriously.
"This was before... you know. We were talking about you and I was playing on the radio. I may have had the tape before I came too. But it's lost forever."
"Yes. Like a snowstorm." She nods. "You could begin to think about the damage that would befall us if you knew what happened here. I was *almost* killed."
"You're right. I care. I care about the little guys, like the little farmers, the little fishermen, the little fishermen, the little fishermen' children."
His eyes are fixed on hers and his mouth moves, but there is a wince of pain in there somewhere. More than that, he is still unable to public communicate.
The lieutenant gently points at the dodgy camouflage. "He told us he can't remember his *own* shirt. They say he is "Kim the Knife." The *The *Crab Man*?"
There's a strange *stuck* hand on the wooden desk, slightly tilted over on its sides. The door has been left unlocked. No one seems to be able to open it.
This is not the time to celebrate. This is not the time to *groom* yourself into a martyr. This is not the time to *grind* your bum. This is not the time.
"Col Do Ma Ma Daqua" is a colloquialism for a person from the Occident. They do not *all* have eczema. Also, people from Mundi, Graad, and even Iilmaraa.
"He said you're his 'pig hooker' -- to friends and strangers alike. Now, does that mean you're also his hooker?" He's still thinking it over in the dark.
"I don't know what you're talking about. There's *nothing* to look over. The Õngretyat is dead and gone. It's not like there's a board room or anything."
"I guess I... I guess I might have been wrong." The man in the dirty tracksuit says to himself. "All I know is that we are here now. This is the police."
"I have no idea what to say, officer." He looks around. "I just know that *you* are twice as good as me. You are a genius and I am merely a stockbroker."
"I have some spare *E50* there for living expenses." She takes the drawing board out of her notebook. "It won't last forever, but it'll suffice for now."
"I'm not gonna give you anything, officer." He doesn't seem to be startled. "What I do want to know is -- what exactly are we trying to accomplish here?"
"It's all right, officer! A lot of people took a dump here." The lieutenant points to a huge pillar. "It's the perfect symbol for the idea of the *new*."
"My only hope is that yours provides a single, concrete suspect before the mercenaries indiscriminately pick theirs? A lynching is what this looks like."
"Thanks for your cooperation." He turns to you. "We should try to find a new tape player. Perhaps we should talk to Roy at the pawnshop -- he had stuff."
"You're a goddamn *goddamn* cop, you're a fucking... *No one* is making ends meet!" She's unpleasantly baffled. "I don't even *want* to hear from you..."
"You're not. I've known you for several years now. And I can vouch for all my staff. None of us would tamper with a crime scene. Not with my experience."
As the cold concrete steps into the bay, something in the silence breaks. You hear the water, mingle with the sand beneath the motor carriage and then...
Suddenly the man starts growling. Three words manage to escape his mouth, along with a strong stench of alcohol: "Fucking... kipt... f****ts... f****ts!"
THE INGENETIC PEOPLE OF TOSAHATAT,ISSURU,ROOF'S GOT THEIR SPOTS DESCHED AND THEIR SPOTS. IT IS MAKING THE WOMAN IN MY COMPANY SMILE AND SPREADING TO ME."
"A professional engineer came in and said the same thing. It must be her *boule*..." His wrinkled face squints, then he pinches his chin and tears free.
"But it's too late. And now I know there haven't been any problems with the paperwork. I thought it'd be interesting to see if the union ever forgives."
"Don't thank me yet." He sniffs the air, then shrugs. "There must be a way in the morning. Hopefully they'll have some in them by the time you wake up."
"I don't see anything that points in that direction. For now let's treat this case as a simple -- albeit sad -- accident, unrelated to the murder case."
"Of course, they forgot the whole *neighbourhood*. There's always something going on in Jamrock." She looks around. "But we're not really neighborhood."
"The way I *know* it's all true -- I saw the investigators for the teams. Now that I'm here for a report I can smell... shit like you wouldn't believe."
"Yes it does, but only because it's in my *inner* self. It's my *inner self*. That's how I know it's *not* worth. In fact, it can't even be *rewarded*."
"Yes, this is your *cosmo-mythology*..." He looks around. "The myth of the *cosmo-mythology* is the story of the sky that's evergreens chasing the sun."
"Yes. It's a sub-routine we will implement. One that makes use of specially trained operatives. We will need to beef up our ability to track them down."
"You know, detective, when I'm out, then I'm really *out*. No need to beat yourself down over it. That's not how a police officer is supposed to *cop*."
"You're not a... *believer* in your own ability to solve crimes, are you?" An officer who looks near enough like a magician puts down the tape recorder.
"You're right. That's the *she* you saw. We have her *concealed* here." The lieutenant leans closer, unable to make out the woman's voice over the wind.
I am going to tell you about *you* who killed him tomorrow instead of *him* -- a simple piece of paper in a box of letters. This is so horrible for him.
Then you see the man bending backwards, his hair wet. Scattered across his shoulders are a baggie of alcohol. He's got a slimy grin on his dimpled lips.
"It's a bad time to start dating a marine like the *Reef Racer*, huh? I hope you don't get a dick like that." He's not convinced the two will work out.
"My name is *Raphael*, and my job is to serve the law. Even the law has its own rules. I'm a *constant* part of the system for the sake of the system."
"No -- that's not it. This isn't your home, you don't *remember* it. Your *real* home is somewhere to stay. Here. In this tent with a view of the bay."
"No one is. There are no traces of this being a crime scene. And certainly no signs of struggle. And the investigation is over. It's time to leave it."
"Sure, you're right. Which requires you to take few extra steps to your left." He points to the door. "Save some change for a bottle of liquor here..."
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scabs -- I even found some teenagers who thought they're cops."
"We've keep looking past the door for ages, but we don't find him there. Or perhaps it's a coincidence, I don't know. Whatever, the door is wide open."
"Yes, you have the *range of position* I've knew for years. And you're using it -- with force, I must say. You definitely aren't matching your weight."
"You have to accept that you *have* to take some time to *re-integrate* with the outside world, whatever it is. With the knowledge *now* -- logically."
No. You don't get *to* the roof, you just get kicked off. You have no control over the equation that's taking place. In that particular way, you don't.
She's not taking it. Her expression is final, her gaze equals to its size. A flame of pain, like a corona shine on her cheeks, slowly seeps into her...
The book contains only a few lines of dialogue from the scene as a whole. What it doesn't contain is a single line of text describing the scene itself.
The lieutenant seems a bit confused by your statement. Then a quick smile spreads across his face, as he turns his attention to whatever you said next.
The reeds dance slowly around the empty trap. The trap's netting trembles. No insect sounds or movement around -- only the reeds' apprehensive hissing.
This is your chance to come up with a really good name for yourself. Get *creative* -- conceptual, artistic, geographical -- develop a unique identity.
"A loyal policeman isn't much like a journalist..." The lieutenant shrugs. "Also -- that's not your normal activity pattern. It's more like a monkey."
"And I realize that their hygiene habits were completely appropriate for a nascent culture... I just didn't feel comfortable. Let's change the topic."
"I'm going to tell you who shot him: the Suresne Brothers. The brothers are good guys. Very good guys. I would have preferred not to talk about it..."
"I'm thinking, yes. Either way, it's something of a madhouse, to me. Funny that your father was just *seen* there, but not you. Solid blacklist shit."
"In the shower -- I see." She puts her hands on her forehead. "Anyway, I should have brought some of that *hair* with me. It was a *trash container*."
"No, no, no. The boiadeiro strangles his beloved and throws her body in the Magritte. Then he rides off, because the Western Plain is calling to him."
"Not much. Can't say *great* things about the city. It's not the best of locations for an independent entrepreneur looking to bring in the long-dead."
"The city of Revachol is a vast, bustling metropolis, home to the horse-racing, disco, and movie stars. One of the most beautiful parts of the world."
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scouring sticks -- you, your first love, Mr. Li Shmin here..."
"What's it like being a SKULL?" One of the twins looks up from her game and says something in a conspiratorial manner, while the third looks confused.
"Yes, it *does*. It's our little secret. The only man to take this place back is Idiot Doom Spiral. She's about to head home. Have a pleasant summer!"
"You know who..." He looks around, looking for someone. "Maybe we should go talk to the Frittte clerk -- he might have information that will help us."
No. We can figure something out, right? The *disco* that one of these machines represents... it does *not* reflect the image of the future found here.
The steaks are beautiful. The color has begun to wear off. You are now left with the option of saving your skin for re-sale or go to the butcher shop.
"Do you happen to know what's going to happen now?" He looks you directly in the eye, then pulls the wool over your eyes. "We should not waste time."
"I'm pretty sure that's the right thing to do. You can just say it and it won't seem so bad. The hole in the ground is a reliable *part* of the RCM."
"I'm sorry, dear -- you've had to drudge through them so many times. Such is field work -- a young child like you can do quite well in the evenings."
"If you want for this task to slowly become impossible, then yes. Otherwise -- no. He's been *hanging out* far too long already. We need to ice him."
"It's a *polite* way of saying the *most* likely candidate would *have* to go through a *detective* case. And I'm not going to be partaking in that."
"It's great," she says with a smile. "It's something that we all want to do. I'm glad we can all work together even if we can't just drink together."
The lieutenant is deeply impressed by your effort. He's sure *you* are very professional in your work and your professionalism about it is admirable.
The lieutenant looks at the crater. "This seems very *recent*," he thinks for a moment, "I think we probably need to check for bullet holes again..."
There you are, sitting alone in her apartment -- this is the last one of your life story and it all starts with one word. It sounds childish, to say:
"Around here, this is how people do it. No matter how odd they are, or whether they are *possessed* or not, they still put their *thou* at heart..."
"Aye, it can be difficult to be on the receiving end of so much mistrust and outright hatred. But you -- you've managed to avoid that fate for now."
"Have fun, Raymond. Will you?" The old man says, suddenly serious. "You're a very funny guy, being drunk. You're right. Never mind, let's all be..."
"I *think* you're right. That's why I *always* say it." He leans closer to the window. "I'm not gonna use my police powers to *discredit* the case."
"I don't know..." He squints at it, trying to remember. "I'm not sure I remember what the Regiment... it's not important I don't remember anything."
"I knew it. I told you, he's one of them. All of them. Union people are Nazis. Can't even understand why they don't want to talk about it any more."
"Let's take it from the top. They made Prussian Tigers -- at the end of the last century -- but then switched over to Crown models. And that was..."
"Oh, my friend. I was just thinking, the most important thing is that you don't fuck this place up any more. It's not like you can get out of it..."
"The fuck are you staring at with your mouth open?!" He gets up. "Take your hands off your holster, eh? Also, I don't know about that radio hack..."
"The table is turned over. You can see it with your own eyes." (Point to the C-App.) "The table is turned over. It's ready to be hacked your way..."
"Your partner, lieutenant Kitsuragi -- I have only just met you -- it is you who brought us together. How much of your time have I talked with you?"
He thinks for a moment. "*You are* right. I have the authority and credibility to make up my mind to let you in. As a citizen and a police officer."
In your dream, you were alone with your partner. You went to talk. You got to ask questions. The whole experience was like walking through a tunnel.
The shit that was coming out of his mouth was pure cocaine. In other words, it's what your body would look like if you smoked like a tobacco picker.
The toilet paper is torn from the loop. Instead of the usual grasshopper excrement, there's a small, brown-eyed boy with a toothbrush near the sink.
"He's a bit shorter than you, everyone is. I'm not the one with the boots." He laughs. "They must be the most shabby pair of boots I've ever seen."
"I knew it! The boiadeiro strangles his beloved and throws his goats for the cows. He kills and eats the poor and turns his gaze to the horizon..."
"That's right, and you need to get your act together." He points at himself ." I have *not* been drinking. I've only been taking my time to think."
"There's no way you could *fit* in that body of yours," the lieutenant replies, shaking his head. "You'll be much smaller then I thought you were."
"This is the *right* place. The *right* place for you and the correct question to ask. There are other people here, and you can do it, too, but..."
"Why should anyone who's dedicated to a cause such as that waste their time and resources, when they could be enjoying the fruits of their labour?"
Fourteen names, none of which strike you a *classic* style. You begin to suspect there may be a *political* agenda to this so-called 'family game'.
He gets up and blows a small siren. "More Grecian salami. I like to think they used it for removing the dead body, but that's a covered story now."
He's not being sarcastic. He's thinking he should have known that you're not from the neighbourhood. The rats *can't help* -- they just don't care.
It appears that you have less than perfect command of your stomach right now, this... This bulge isn't the kind you can manage in a single sitting.
It is not the first time I've heard someone say that someone should *not* hide the sad face of their deceased loved one, but this one is different.
The man stands under the table, holding a rifle. Behind him, the four men on the fence are shouting something in the secrecy of their hidden realm.
The two trailers under the overpass. Every now and then they're crushed under the weight of large blocks of concrete. They can never be used again.
"I am not letting my business partner down!" He waves his hand at you in a calm, defiant manner. "Is there anything else you could tell me about?"
"I guess that makes sense, yes. He's going to school for it. Next year, in the evening. I told the headteacher I'm leaving -- and she thanked me."
"I like this place, but there are *some* restrictions. We can't leave the building here." He looks around. "Maybe you can help me with something?"
"I'm not even gonna get into the other options -- you might want to do that, too." He points to the pulley system. "But let's get back to this..."
"I've seen this shit a million times, Titus. Flyfishing -- always ignoring the rule of law." He nods approvingly. "The dead fuck did the talking."
"It's called the off-site copy, right? It may be *that* she ran from the police. In *my* town. I don't know why. I only know we didn't get her..."
"No, he did not seem to be *animated* when they called him a bum. For example, he would often call me a bum, even when I'm out of the whole mess."
"No, we're not *getting* to speak like equals. We should visit the library again, maybe ask one of the run-times for the keys, then we can go in."
"The best part of your *vacation* is that you find yourself." He chuckles. "It's like I was preparing a field autopsy for this particular case..."
"The little woman on the boat has a warm smile. She doesn't say anything." She looks around, then points to herself. "Why do you think that's so?"
"This has been staring at me for a long time, yellowing up all over again." She looks around. "There aren't stairs -- it's like I can't reach it."
"This is some serious shit-licking and PING-ponging." He stares at the crowd of gamblers, who all feel that they know everything about this world.
"We should talk about this later. Now that we're done here -- you can take your things. I'll get going now if you don't mind. Thank you." [Leave.]
"What? Of course -- been here for more than three days now -- and this place sure isn't empty. So I'm scared -- especially here." He looks around.
"You can't use words like that to describe what happened here. These are just descriptions. I found the place. I'm sure it's not the right place."
"You're in charge of the kid's street drug trade. He's also the father of plantations in Mali and the Semenine Islands. The one way or the other."
No matter how you crane your neck, you can't see the whole of the neck, even under the giant magnifying glass. If you can, then it's for the best.
The lieutenant nods. "And I also thank you for your assistance. We have a couple of cases to get back to. There's always something in the fridge."
"Ah, of course, officer! I wouldn't have believed you'd only ask about *one* thing..." The old woman looks towards the sunset, lost in the music.
"Don't think, lieutenant. Cuno's father could've been a cop. Cuno's dad is probably dead to me by the way. I'm not guilty of being a Cuno's dad."
"Don't worry, Titus, we know her. Besides, there are no non-corrupt systems in the world anyway. And *moralism* is the most corrupt of them all."
"Egg alert!" It doesn't take long for the guy to hear that *friendly* fisher-folk on the plaza are breaking into the island's secret food supply.
"I don't know how to put it..." He inspects the decayed wooden planks surrounding the tabletop. "I'm sure the pawnbroker just scrounged them up."
"I don't know... maybe the woodwork? Maybe the drugs? Nope. Look -- the real killer is always sneaking around, building super-secret techniques."
"I've heard that this happens sometimes. Especially in big cities. Sometimes they get strange." He pauses to think. "It's like a heart attack..."
"It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It was the most *vivacious* thing I've ever seen." She smiles. "C'mon, man, he's a hero, right?"
"Let's be honest, we're not exactly strangers here, are we?" He leans closer to look around -- at the empty square. Then shrugs: "We don't care."
"She's not mad, I know she's trying to do something. It's hard to say what exactly, but her exact words are: 'I am a revolutionary war criminal."
"The idea that I could *interfere* in the internal affairs of another person's business is unthinkable. That's right, there are no words for it!"
"The softest of them all -- a dame." She sighs. "Daughter of a bitch, who's only good for peddling welkins or whatever creeps she comes up with."
"They got it," the lieutenant says, his hand on the gun. "And I'm not going to let you steal my precious cargo. We have a responsibility to you."
"This peculiar seed is yours." She puts a couple of coins in the precinct's little slot for you. "If you ever need parts, it's here in the city."
"Yes. Like... the third thing." He takes his glasses off to clean them. "I got 'The Greatest Innossence' written on the chin. This looks fine..."
"Yes. We should consider the possibility that *you* brought them both. We don't know yet... there's a possibility. But not a *very* large one..."
"You're in my inner circle. You too, Harry." He smiles warmly. "We can talk about anything: the strike, the murder, your lost gun -- *anything*."
A man and a woman in a short dress enter the room. A young woman. The youngest is just shy of 14. The woman is about to cry. The man is about to.
It's not the fault of the man in the jacket. The most common reason for a murder is a man in a bad mood and he's suddenly overcome with the same.
Suddenly, the man starts growling. Three words manage to escape his mouth, along with a strong stench of alcohol: 'Fucking... kipt... f****ts...'
The man puts his hands on the pistol. "This is your gun. You will not stop shooting this shit, Cuno. If you have to go, this is the gun for you."
"I think I got the picture right. I was trying to draw an obvious conclusion. I don't want to get back down here..." He looks at the roof again.
"I'm sure you have the legal right to demand that information," the lieutenant replies, looking you straight in the eye. "Why won't you let me?"
"No, no, no." The lieutenant shakes his head. "We have a *murder* to solve, and yet you go around asking everyone about money." He looks around.
"Right, ok, I was just making fun of you. Time to get back to *reality*. After you're done your little joke will be forgotten... because of me."
"This is just the name of the station I went to. But you should know that the station name is *Reality* -- and that I am still here, waiting..."
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scabs -- how many of you are in the same room with him?"
*Piss* has won you the favour of a *hustler* -- you should thank your lucky stars, because this is *very* bad news for booze consumption indeed.
A flush of excitement, yes. This is a *thing*. Even something as seemingly banal as the *pleasure* of them, translated from arts to criminology.
A short, sharp voice answers the other end. "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for us to get in her way, we just wanted to ask her about the weapon."
As you turn around, the first thing you see is a collection of tarpaulin flapping in the wind. Some of them are probably still there -- waiting.
Her sudden smile shifts into one of concern. "I arrived to free your life, your privacy, but -- yeah. That was a careless move. Lost something."
The man looks at you for a long moment, silent and serious. "I can't. It's too painful. I just..." He breathes on his fingers clasping the plan.
"A person of uniform and a weapon. A man of the left and the right. A politician and an outlaw. A cop and an outlaw. A mourner and a fugitive."
"I don't care about *the other* people, I'm not relevant to the case, and the PUBLISHER *I* is part of the *I* of the world. I can just *cry*!"
"I don't even know what you're going to say, officer." He looks around in the room. "It's nothing. Just a few things I want to know about you."
"I know." She looks at the black pride in your eyes. "I thought we could rely on the cops. We're in this together, whether you like it or not."
"It's a bunch of... things. My hands, my feet, my head, my organs, my brain, my... lungs..." He tries to catch his breath. "But most of all..."
"It's not just the Union, or even the Coalition Government -- there are also *Two Thousand Two Hundred and Seven Dead* on the Official Records.
"No. I would say it's *very* bad." He turns to you. "You're drunk like a bum, Harry. Please put the stolen rifle away before you kill someone."
"No." The one with the necklace stares at you coldly. "You don't get to squeeze out every drop of us after keeping us in the dark for so long."
"Oh god..." She looks at her hands, then at you. "The rum is *worse* than the liquor. There's just no way to *handle* it. It's not your fault."
"Oh, I would say it's *very* bad." He turns to you. "You're drunk like a bum, Harry. Please put the stolen rifle away before you kill someone."
"She's been there for two days now..." He points to the chair. "The chair is old and the legs are rotting. She's been there for two days now.""
"She's right -- there are not enough *good* people to keep the big man up at night. You're right, he's in a hurry, trying to leave you behind."
"So I went outside and took care of the corpse. According to the local shopkeeper, it was about to be picked up by the thieves at the harbour."
"That's right. It's the most precious of all the precious things. It's a *collection*. An *experimental* way of saying it. It's a way of life."
"There are many versions of this story, and they all say the hero is always young and beautiful. So I chose the one with the brightest future."
"Unbelievable, don't you think?" The young man nods. "Charismatic police officers are not supposed to lie to you. I'm sure it's not a problem."
"You've reached the end of your tether, right?" He taps on the computer in the corner. "Now go inside and read the rest of the bulletin board."
(Turn to the lieutenant.) "I'm sorry, detective, we just can't make out the Aeroflot building on the map. Too dangerous to go there anyways..."
She didn't. It wasn't a *case*. She was talking about the *prison*. A solitary death. And it came from out in the open somewhere around here...
There's some sort of an entity *behind* the entity. Some kind of evil spirit or force that's out to murder the world, or destroy it completely.
"I'd see about going to the coast, enjoy the flowers there -- don't hear about it." The woman passes a cigarette through her stubby black pen.
"I'm not sure about that. The room was probably loaded with rags, and he certainly didn't look like a *serious* guy. Just a delicate old man."
"Is someone *there*?" With a squeak, the old man sits up -- and coughs: "What is this? Get the fuck off my cot, I have a phallus in my mouth!"
"It's not like that. They're what you call *heterosexual life partners*. They have a battle-tested relationshit. A 'bröderbund,' if you will."
"No, my grandma told me they all went to the aerodrome, at the age of forty, and landed in the first cold land of the salt-industrial empire."
"No," he says without even smiling. "A future of dance, revolution, and human-centric business models is just around the corner for Revachol."
"Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't understand what you were trying to achieve with this..." He stops. "It's more like a... *your* problem, all right?"
"Okay, a soldier would probably beat it. Don't go expecting me to stand in the middle of that camp." She rubs her hands together. "Hard core."
"Pig!" She adjusts her cap. "I'm not gonna call you a racist. I just wanted to make sure you understand that I'm not gonna call you a racist."
"The same jolly gentleman -- when I first met him, he was a quiet, unassuming man. He's very introverted. He's a workaholic, not a party guy."
"This would fit the statement of another witness, wouldn't it? Like a... big würm coming from the sea. It was quite big -- in the eye of God."
"We should have arrested her..." The lieutenant breaks his silence. "Why? She's a flight risk -- harassing citizens, stealing their property."
"What do you think this *hanging* was for? To get a good look. The cops would have to come here. This is not a safe place for working, is it?"
"Yes. I'm very sorry, Officer Du Bois..." He turns to the lieutenant. "Reports do not come in. And what were you looking at in these files..."
"You said it's just a *pale latitude compressor*. You know what you're doing there. You rig the source through..." She pauses, looking around.
"You're not a gardener, you're a cafeteria manager." He taps on the plastic about a centimetre away from the podium. "So what's on your mind?"
"You're right. You're a great detective. Great luck with your next *investigation*." He looks around. "I hope you're not having a *nice* day."
The wind pushes the leaves under the seat and into the engine compartment. It keeps rolling and tossing them in the direction of the stairs...
"Beautiful? No. It's *beautiful* -- we're witnessing the rise of the very *low* kind of beauty, the kind that could wipe out the very world."
"How did you know? There's no record of what was happening on the island -- until this *demonstration*." He looks around. "Why not, perhaps?"
"I *love* my *mother*, my *mother's* name, my mother's maiden name, and it's the name of my grandmother. It was my great-grandmother's name."
"I'm going to say it again -- Cuno doesn't feel like he needs you fucking with this. Cuno feels LIKE HE COULD HAVE KILLED HIM. Just not you."
"I'm not the only one who wants to sit at the bar! There are all kinds of..." She looks around. "I don't know what to say. It's a challenge."
"I've been meaning to get it, but my finger keeps getting caught... I'll have to find a new set before I can make it in there first, though."
"Oh, no. This is the most important thing. The percentage of the core network that the network will remain in. Everything else is secondary."
"Sure, go ahead, it's a beautiful space." He looks around. "There's no one in here. Let's call the library -- it's probably the storekeeper."
"The *other* thing is, he has been quite active recently. Noted a series of mysterious deaths in a *district* in the west end. Very strange."
"What? What's wrong, he thought you could take these with you. You're too old. Too far gone." She nods to the tall man. "Thank you for that."
"Yes, what next?" He nods towards the massive pool table with his hand on the broken table. "It's all combined... but it's not all tidy now."
"You're right. I'm better trained than you -- more qualified than you -- but having played soccer myself, I'm sure I'm equal to you in this."
(Turn to the lieutenant.) "I got nothing to hide, but if I ever need to talk to you, I'll do it right here at the station, not in the field."
He means a specific branch of family or something with a *special* relationship to Revachol, but he will *not* stop discussing them with you.
Just a bunch of arses talking about *Baskin'* and *Spottin'*. You don't care, though. You don't like each other. You only want *information*.
No, no. The only thing of value is your body. It doesn't matter if it's full of *fat-balls*, it still *definitely* counts as valuable tissue.
The lieutenant's voice is low, almost petulant, as he repeats again: "Get your *pistols* ready, pig! The place is gonna be ablaze with them."
"Are they?" Her mouth is thin and quivering, with worry in her eyes. "I shouldn't have listened to you, I think I had an ulterior motive..."
"Good. The RCM is a police force. It's neither a *thing* nor an *encounter*. It's a *strategy*. I've been doing it for three centuries now."
"Hey! Look at me! Look at me!" She smiles innocently. "I'm a cop, I'm just smoking a cigarette. I don't know how to *communicate* with you."
"I'd appreciate it if you didn't force me into situations where I can't respond ... honestly, that's some of the worst shit I've ever done."
"I'm a police man (Quelle)," he intones, "touch me on the shoulder: I'm under stress, you see. I'd rather die than let you burgle the city."
"I'm not really here to bother you, officer." She looks around, her hands on her hips. "I'm here to serve and protect the city of Revachol."
"It's a pity," he says. "I would have preferred us to take the case. It was getting *too* difficult for us to ascertain the cause of death."
"No good deed ever done again! That was a lie." She shakes her head, then turns to the man and says: "And what happened to the Cuno's body?"
"Nothing. I just wanted to see what happens. If it's not her... then she's *not* running a drug lab. Or running a drug lab for that matter."
"Very well, then." He looks at you, a little disappointed. "I'm afraid I can't say any more until we've taken care of some *legal* matters."
"You know, it's okay for me to be the biggest fan of this new hat tech you've ever seen, but I don't think you should settle down just yet."
"You won't regret it," the man nods, smiling. "You'll definitely remember it when you remember that *shitload* of cocaine your grandma did."
But don't you dare *lose* the *momentum* that's come to you. Because *it's* going to come to you -- your power will explode from the depths!
The building is vacant, dirty and filthy, a pile of passing cars and trash fall over all the windows. The postcard you found there is empty.
The street is a noisy hell on earth. The police come and go like the tides. But you can't get in. You can't get out. You live in the street.
The sun is so high up in the sky that you can't see it. The wind so cold it can't be imagined. The city so cold it can't be imagined either.
There's a pause, then he continues: "We should also give the Jamrock Library a call, see if we can learn anything about this Billie Méjean."
"A quick quésiton of *personalities.* Myself, your partner, and the rest of the party..." He puts his hands on his hips. "Let's get going."
"A very good call! If the ICP manages to retain some basic information about the world, the world will be *much* better for human workers."
"Crabman!" He leans back. "When this shit was all about the mail you nailed it to the wall -- maybe your *facial symmetry* is good enough."
"Not fancy, but it's still good, isn't it?" The man says to himself. "This is not the *dream* of a policeman -- nor was it your *hunting*."
"You're right, you shouldn't have." She looks at your hand trembling from the pain. "You're not even *holding* the jacket itself, are you?"
He nods approvingly. "This is also the reason why the *monokais* are constantly moving from place to place. They come to collect the dead."
He wants you to feel *special*. That's how he's going to keep you happy under all the stress and strain this conversation is going to take.
She looks you dead in the eye. "Maybe it's the dead boy? He said you killed him. It must have been you. Because you had to kill him again."
The man's face contorted in an exaggeratedly serious expression, the look of surprise and puzzlement that you received from his expression.
There is a chance that a more powerful opponent could have escaped his grasp while another, unknown foe kept watch over your injured leg...
This is one of those buildings that are *not* hard to *entrap* yourself in, it's rather hard to *escape* from -- and harder still to *win*.
You're a master of stealth, but even with your master plan there is not anything else you can do. A great roar, over the entire Martinaise.
"Aye, but I am a police officer. I can't sit here and think about things. It's not the *normal* thing to do. I shouldn't have been there."
"But last night, just after midnight -- I woke up to an out-of-place noise. A horrible scream, like the sound of a woman being strangled."
"Have you ever seen the colourline bit right before you hit yourself with it? Looks like someone's got stripped some wets on your  cheek."
"I hope so, I truly do. If I don't stick around then it's all over. So I guess I guess I sorta have a little bit of a home here." He nods.
"I know that's the name of your station, but that's not the name of your precinct. That's the name of your Precinct. So please change it."
"No, I'm not." She looks around the room. "I *am* the church, I'm not going to keep it for myself -- I'm going to keep it for the people."
"The investigation?" He covers his mouth, trying to suppress a coughing fit. "It's a *mystery*. We don't know the exact cause of death..."
"Well, I guess that's what I should have been using. This might have been good practice for the others. I think you've got a point there."
"Yes we are, detective." The lieutenant looks at you. "So let me guess... you're *not* trying to impress *me* with a stunt of this sort. "
"You're right, lieutenant -- she certainly had that effect on you. But -- I mean, if it was so *bad*, why do you still feel like you *need
He considers it for a moment. "If I put five reál in there they will *all* skulking around. I make a point of keeping them out, though..."
He nods. "It's not just the smell of the chamber. You can tell there was something important in there -- and you have no idea what it is."
Lieutenant Kitsuragi does some investigating on his station's target list. Probably for his own good, thinking that this an isolated case.
The corpse is indifferent, as he yawns and settles down to rest. A single bone, mostly silver in colour, sticks out from the amalgamation.
The dead man not only has a pair of eyes, but also a pair of ears and a pair of whisker -- but he does it *flakier* than a police officer.
You can always go into your closet, then use an old pair of handcuffs. It's easy to lose your gun now, but, hey, it might be cool someday!
"*Cuno's* a little too drunk to teach you some lesson, though..." The man has a smile on his face. "Just feel free to throw it in there."
"Fuck it..." The man shrugs. "I'll take it off the bill! Sleep in a post-apocalyptic hell-hole if I want to. I'm fuckin' okay with that."
"I am *not* going to ask about the case, officer. I don't want to get into it. Just know -- on this one -- and on this one, we got this."
"It's a good-looking place, but also a place of *shame*." He puts his hand on your shoulder like a grown man doing a quick calculation...
"The fuck did you want? Cuno's not a real b-gun! Get out of my shop, you FUCKING LEAVE!" He gestures for you to step down from the frame.
"This is a healthy post-workout drink," the woman behind the bar points to the beer. "You'll feel better soon. It's just a quick memory."
"Yeah, what?" He glances at you behind his ears. "I haven't even received a single coherent, rational thought. It was just a metaphor..."
"You better make sure your friend isn't dead, or I'll be in a better position to take care of this." She picks up a bottle of cold water.
Chatterjee is a term of endearment popular among the upper-class women of the south-east. It's a shame they didn't invent it before them.
The light of the video rental shines through her dress now. A dolorian figure, cut in black, moves below. Its limbs are long and slender.
The stage is empty. A former model, dressed like a teenager. Your friend must have fantasized about the time he and Ryder were teenagers.
"Don't worry, detective." He looks over his shoulder toward the door. "It's not like you're going to have to *bargain* with me over it."
"Gun!" She smiles happily. "We have *all* guns -- yeah, that's what Graad is -- guns of mass murder. You're fucking with the right gun."
"I think the lieutenant is right. If you wanted the case done as quickly as possible -- you'd have found a way to *let* me in the door."
"Oh, so that's what this is about. You think I'm fucking *stupid*, cop? Well..." It's not meant as criticism, it's meant to comfort you.
"Please don't take this the wrong way, it's just a collegial observation. In the 57th we call it the 'Jamrock shuffle'. You deserve it."
"There are four in total. One is to the south, on this little peninsula -- by the boat houses there." He points south. "It's very near."
"This is a disgrace. Not only is the police refusing to investigate this crime, you're ignoring our best chance to catch the criminals."
"You're right. This is a modified version of my ideology. My money has probably been better off on some kind of a *political* solution."
"Your father used to go to that island too. Not on a drunk or on the street, but on rare occasions when he had to. He was a decent man."
A shadow of a smile appears on his lips. Something is missing. The rest is very hard to produce. It's impossible to decipher what it is.
Good. We've talked about it. We've talked about it clear, *literal* terms of endearment. We've even talked about anatomical deformities.
The woman's voice sounds almost melodramatic as she adds: "So be careful. Let's go pick up some more of those old rusty old millstones."
The young man is staring at the door with a derisive smile. "It was *really* a good idea, though. It's a good idea. It's a *good* idea."
Yeah, you got a joke. But don't do anything. Just watch him do whatever it is. Watch the way he looks down on the world. It's his to do.
"And so much more... It's almost impossible to not enjoy a great read -- especially one written by someone so famous like Jules Verne."
"But it's in Jamrock... it's *in* Jamrock. They made it the hell first, but now it's all gone. A forgotten historic piece of the past."
"Dang," he says with a chuckle. "Dang is what you get for being a cockatoo. They think they're above the law, because they're elected."
"I don't have to." He stares into the bottle. "There, in the grey, is the *sewer*. If you have to... no need for this ridiculous sump."
"I got my hands dirty with the testicular cancer that was taking root, but really I just wanted to hear yourself say... what happened."
"I heard you from the library. And I'm sad to say that you're not talking about them. There's a goddamn FOUR-TON MANTIS on the island."
"I know what you're thinking. He was a big man. Couldn't move like that. He must have been exhausted from his work..." He says nothing.
"I know you... we've heard of 'Klaasje' before. We haven't heard what kind of the crime she committed. Maybe it was as simple as that?"
"It's the meltdown of a democracy" he says. "The revolution will finally come. Time is for us to reach our goal. The war's not over..."
"Most of the men on this military base look like they know everything about it, but they *don't* care about the people they've killed."
"No one's actually killed a person yet, just an area in the city we were passing through. There's a small town of ten thousand people."
"Sounds like we can get some peace..." He pauses, reflecting on the conversation. "It didn't work out. Is that your... responsibility?"
"Sure, cop, sure." He brushes little sticks of chewing gum in his index finger. "I don't care. Where do we get a pack of Royal Extras?"
"Sure, Harry." He looks at his friend. "It's not like we're going to be just friends any more. The Unbelievable Things we do together."
"The point is, this is it." The lieutenant extends his hand. "You're gonna need that new drawbridge and the new poles to get up there."
"The waveform was *extremely* off. I was ready to blow, a hundred times, for the hundredth time... but we got this *after* the damage."
"This case is what you came to investigate. You could say you were *invested* with them -- that you're a police officer and a general."
"We should find out what's on this island before we even *consider* taking him down. One of the things they say is that it's deserted."
"You're right, I don't." The lieutenant turns to you. "You can get a nice, comfy place here if you want. I'll help you make it easier."
The dark shadow of the church is drawn out on the sand... two men, their tongues colluded, standing in front of each other. In silence.
The lieutenant is at the end of the wooden stick talking with a young person on his right. It's windy. He leans in to inspect the card.
The man is trying to ignore the smoke damage, concentrating on the car at an angle. His back is straight: it's a police motor carriage.
"I don't know what to say. I got so angry I threw a rock through the fucking window. It broke the window, and the hole got a name...."
"I think the *desert* was before I saw you," the lieutenant responds, looking to the sea. "This area may hold special *significance*."
"It's not a regular headless soldier. I'm sure it's not like that." She taps her foot. "You're right, it's not a *police* motorcycle."
"May be," she replies with another puff of that cigarette. "I'll just keep the Cor-de-Leite in the channel, if that's what you think."
"My mind is too ..." He looks around in the room, then turns to you: "This is my room, I'm not gonna let you go down without a fight."
"No, we're not," the lieutenant states firmly. "We are traitors -- boys without honour and power. This is the crime, pure and simple."
"No, your partner is a super-star cop, right?" He leans in. "Are you really going to be so... noble now that you're a super-star cop?"
"The body was transported to Precinct 41. For identification. I've been able to access my personal files. The case number, of course."
"They weren't really there. I think the killer went in at night. They were hanging out in the ruins of a building. And then, nothing."
"Unfortunately it's quite difficult to be sure. Are you sure you get the remotest stretch of road? No, you get there, maybe one more."
Carrying a revolver. Looks like an old cross between a kite and a reed. Have you noticed that weird thing under the back of your neck?
He looks at the wall and sighs. "I'm not sure I want to be the one to make you the home for the night. I'm not a super-detective now."
Sane religion, like agriculture, doesn't tend to put as much time and effort into authenticity as it does on the superficial moralism.
She makes you feel like an idiot. You should just relax. You look like a stupid cop, if you ask me. The world is not a laughing place.
The lieutenant is unmoved, his eyes fixed on the piles of corpses on the winter's ice -- then, suddenly, there's a twitch in his chin.
You begin to suspect there may be a *political* agenda to this so-called 'normal' case'. Only a thought so now, but you can feel it...
"An aerostatic is an airship. A hybrid airship, semi-rigid." He points up to a small dot in the cloudline. "*That* is an aerostatic."
"Have you ever tried your hand at graffito? When faced with a blank wall, most people write unimaginative stuff like *Pigs Go Home*."
"I'm right, the red-heads are stupid -- if they don't want to work, they ought to opt for manual labour. At least in the Safre area."
"Look at you, Cuno, look what's *there*!" He looks around, then to you. "Now, how about it? Tell me *how* you can help me out, Cuno."
"My God..." Her expression turns hysterical. "You gotta get your shit together -- get a hold of yourself, Harry! I'll do it for you."
"No, officer, I am not. Some of the best teams in the RCM use radios to call their areas." He nods. "It's incredibly easy, you know."
"Of course I understand you want to help me. But you need to know... about the real reason I'm going to do it. I *know*, lieutenant."
"Right." She turns to face the sea. It's almost two kilometres away, on an islet in the Bay of Revachol. The island is called Oranje.
"The other drivers were hiding in the forest, but all they did was speed. I could tell they were hiding for speed, because I saw it."
"Well then, questions." She presents the photograph, then turns to Titus, who's patiently waiting for it to be placed on the board...
"Yes! We should use the radio in my Kineema to call your station from Kineema, maybe we can use Frittte to send a boat back for you."
"Yes," he says with a nod. "They're almost grown up now. They've had their share of drinking trouble and their share of shootings..."
In the background of the voice you pick up, you hear: "We're still waiting on the door... I don't know, is this... your *real name*?"
Oh! You want to know about that *lucky* jacket, but all you can do is find out more about its history. No one can tell you that much.
"Everyone has their own methods of coping, some more effective, or self-destructive, than others..." He gives you a meaningful look.
"He is a fine chap, Harry. Just relax and enjoy the moment. There are too few good times to keep us distracted." She smiles, gently.
"I have no issue with my *brother* and his friends. However, one thing I can tell you right now is -- there's a big one down there."
"I think we can all agree that this guy is not going to be a stand-in for our little party tonight, is there? I had a whole plan..."
"I think you had your chance, officer." He says, slowly shaking his head. "Now let's talk about some of the things you *did* wrong."
"I thought it was part of my *master plan*."" He sighs. "I still can't believe I got you guys all mixed up like this. I'm so sorry."
"I was kinda hoping the dance club would be my *home*. I know the people there like it -- everyone wants to get a rise out of this."
"I'm not here to make excuses for them -- I don't want to do that. I just have a *little* bit of a problem with that kind of thing."
"It's the shopkeep, right?" She looks at the window. "We're called *On the Corner*, because that's what we sell. Anything but that."
"My boss *is* making my business hard." The lieutenant waves his hand at the woman. At one point, he even tried to intimidate her...
"No. There is nothing more ominous than a photo -- no one has been afraid of the truth." He nods. "Just ask normal questions, okay."
"The guy with the big mouth?" He looks at you. "I know the definition of a *boule* -- one who is not willing to work for their pay."
"The RCM should be able to take care of those who are unable to communicate in a timely manner. Like those who are terminally lost."
"The Union was formed by a coalition of the world's great powers: the United States, the Russian Federation, the French Republic..."
"You're holding a gem, a precious stone. A white gem, I think. It's the middle of the road. The way people go home. White and blue."
No-no no-no no no-no, you heard the drill. The rest's just a *slo-mo*, what you say, just the rest. No need to throw it out again...
The man on the couch swivels to the side, looking up at the sky. His eyes are fixed on the system as the machine hums in the corner.
"*Beside* of those..." the man looks around, suddenly unimpressed. "There's also the matter of those other *pornographic* items..."
"*Yes* you're right. I'm into a very simple and straightforward survivalist way of life, that still works well and gives me peace."
"A lot of people did not know what the fuck you were talking about! This is a group effort. That's why the movie poster is broken."
"I can't help you out, I'm busy *at the moment*." He turns to you. "I'm sure he's gonna tell you one of your secrets, one of ours."
"I didn't know that..." She looks around, then says: "It was a lovely night. But I don't want to talk about it. It's not about me."
"I was born and raised on the sea, so the land of the sea is the *real* land. There is no such thing as a 'non-existent landmass.'"
"I'm not going to try to sell you a *Col D'Orleans* or *a* *Perikarnassian* or *a* *Cuno* whatever the fuck you want to call it..."
"It was a *dream* and I thought it had never gone *this* crazy." He looks around. "We haven't even seen the *wild* wild thing yet!"
"This has been educational, sadly. If we happen on the *Third Presence* in our travels we will undoubtedly come back and tell you."
"This is what they call a 'rebel' -- a militant nationalist who wants to return to the past, but with the right *social* values..."
"Uhm, you kicked the tare machine. Please don't kick the tare machine. This is Frittte -- and you don't want to fuck with Frittte."
"What about you?" She looks around. "You didn't even look at the map that we handed you. We all knew you would spot it from there."
"Who the fuck's going to clean it? Who the fuck are you, detective?" The questions are accompanied by the sounds of breaking glass.
"You know..." She looks around. The spring sun has already risen over the sea; the water is starting to brown around the buildings.
"You're right. Someone else is *not* going to set up the hotel, even if they have the exact same name and the exact same employer."
"You're the Chief. It's how you do business. You get your hands dirty, and you just keep the place running *as* a police precinct."
The night sky is black and the streets are empty. Nearly two thousand people have taken refuge in the shelter beneath the motorway.
There it is again, the great *dream* again. The waves are still rushing by and the air feels heavier and heavier beneath your skin.
"Central nervous system," he says and then concludes abruptly: "No, he's not dead, he's in coma state... *possibly* even *death*."
"Don't be glum, detective. There's always next time. Figuratively, I mean. There's no way we have time to play this game again..."
"Goddamn right!" He nods. "Yes. That activates something in me -- you winning the lottery. For everyone. We *lost* the lottery..."
"I don't know what to say. You look like a police officer. I don't actually know anything about cops. I have no idea what you do."
"I've gotta admit it: icy cold, the kind you can't remember much of about your life in had it just fizzled out because of liquor."
"It's a type of mediocrity that, I think, under the guise of hard core, hides behind a feigned indifference to physical violence."
"Never," he says, his eyes looking south. "I like the ground above the street the best, but not here -- I'd rather write it down."
"Okay. Well, it's a bit confusing, I must go..." She pats her coffee cup while searching for a pen, just as she's about to sign...
"Remember, this is *something* that you *must* accomplish. This is *something* you *must* *know* about yourself." He looks around.
"Talkin' to Cuno. Talkin' to the fucking pig. Talkin' to Revachol Ice City. He's fucking town -- he's gotta be the fuckin' mayor."
"This is a *parody* of the RCM." The young guy waves his hand in a suggestive manner, as if mocking you for being too *sensitive*.
"What if I'd just ask him normal questions or you might try to spruce things up? What if I'm not a psychopath, or I'm just *hot*?"
"You can't take the final step with your name. Only your work will take the final step. I was feeling a little more invincible..."
*It's* a pretty good handle, but there is no handle. It's a *pistol* and a *less* important pistol. The rifle itself is brand new.
He smiles like a madman, a man who has survived a world so incredibly vast. It's not about you, it's about the wind and the stars.
It feels like you're *denying* her a certain amount of money. But tell her it's the matter of her SOUL, and her SOUL is hard core.
This is it. He has told me the whole affair, the whole *investigation* is now in his hands -- and he *can* keep it secret from me.
"Detective or no one would believe me... if it were any other day, I would take her to a hospital. See you on the *other* coast."
"From what I've seen of the officers of the RCM..." he starts, looking you over, then stops himself, focusing again on the  cage.
"I think he meant it when he said *you're under* guard. Just write down his name if you want to get to the bottom of this story."
"I was just sixteen, and I had to inflate myself to keep going. I was also very small then. And stupid. And naive. And mostly..."
"I'll be specific. I don't want to make it sound like we've got a *vote*. Let's get back to the cause -- the man's *maneuvered*."
"No, it's still here." The lieutenant points to the statue of the Marquis de Sade. "Who knows what it's doing in that damn wind?"
"That's enough." The lieutenant shakes his head. "We should get back to our case. Like we were investigating a murder last week."
"We should have arrested her..." The lieutenant looks to the sea. "Maybe there's a way to get a good, hard copy from the island."
"We're in Martinaise, of course. It's part of my job to make sure *things* don't run smoothly. All I need to do is set the mood."
"You know, a week ago, I had these *fantastic* people on my train. Now -- we've been running around together doing *odd things*."
"Your father used to go to that island too. And it's a good thing he went. Not a lot of good guys in Revachol West these days..."
A small bell-like sound fills the air. You feel the lightening in the electric coil as the barrel begins to spin, then to move...
As a soldier of fortune he can make an enemy out of you. It's something to be used for the future; something that is good indeed.
He was afraid. And still remains safe enough to take out his sidearm. It's unclear whether he still has it in him Saturday night.
I understand, you're saying. It must have been extremely high, but you have brain damage -- you've turned yourself into an idiot.
The lieutenant shakes his head. "I'm trying to borrow some money from the man across the canal. There must be a pawnshop nearby."
Yes, listening to your *hundred thousand years of history, it seems like no one has ever doubted the blueness of your forehead...
"Cuno knows what you meant." He looks at you. "Cuno's not a snivelling shit-heel chasing the ball game. Cuno's a hard core man."
"I don't know..." The lieutenant shakes his head. "Actually, you probably know what crime is. I'm about to discuss it with you."
"I got told by a well-meaning but *still* naive young man. He told me he doesn't need a lot of alcohol to get into some unrest."
"I think it's better than having a dead kid." He stares into the burning embers. "I can still see his face and tell it's *you*."
"Let's get the fuck out of here." He looks around. "Cuno doesn't give a shit about that freak armour. Not after he's seen it..."
"No, I'm tired of this gloomy omen. This is my generation's fascism. If I'm not careful, I'm not gonna get old, I'm gonna fail."
"No, you're not. Don't think that way..." she says, slowly shaking her head. The wind brings a strand of hair to her rough face.
"No." The kid suddenly looks very young and small. "She was dead when the Union doctor arrived. Cuno saw them put her in a bag."
"Okay, so I met this girl off the street. She's *lucky* too -- couldn't get a hold of her when we were checking out the church."
"She's in an advanced stage of Alzheimer's alone. Not a lot of mental horsepower to get through an entire winter. I understand."
"So cool. So cool -- you find some random interesting information, steal it, put it in your mouth -- then tell me where it was."
"Sure." She looks at you. "It's a nice little shop with lots of *fun* with nice decorations, but it's not really *my* business."
"There are antiques enthusiasts who believe that the antiques they're researching are connected to the insular microtechnology."
"There's something out there. To do. I told you. The other one is a steel-reinforced cargo belt. There's... like a ton of them."
"This looks bad," Kim looks you over, then you over again, trying to gauge the general state of decay. "What's happening to me?"
"We moved." He exhales to calm his breathing. "She got desperate. And the desperate *women* she was looking for were after her."
"Yes, it sounds like you're the captain-person on the scene. We're gonna need to tell the people you ran into the station at..."
"Yes, the *Nightclubs of Versailles* are the most beautiful place in the world. All of them are. They're all equally beautiful."
"You don't know, cop man. He's a book-gimp. Maybe even *too* good. Try not to piss yourself when he tells you about the crimes."
*And* you've maintained your disguise through three days of interviewing. Even a man your age cannot afford to be so unmolested.
A lone figure is standing behind a metal container that looks like a door. Two people are standing in the yard -- two teenagers.
He takes a long, hard look at the cement. "That's a good point. See, these things take time -- it *is* time, and time is money."
It's a mystery the body can talk back to you if you don't have anything to say. He has already mastered the interrogation skill.
No... no, tell me! The sun is not going down! Get out of there! You're not letting anyone come back, you're letting them in now.
You see the man in the corner of the room, staring at the dicemaker. His eyes are sparkling, but he's not looking for an answer.
"Age is a tough thing. Beni is as old as them all. Obviously. But he's just 51. Despite his grizzled, face-catching hairstyle."
"Cool. This is where he *decimated* his enemies. The broadside is a modern military assault armored personnel carrier, is all."
"Did... did you fuck her?" He looks at you. "You fucked her with a whore dick. Not *that*, you fucking cocksucker. Not *that*."
"Except that one time, when he stopped to sing karaoke. Which, by the way, was a valiant effort. He really sang his heart out."
"He didn't *disappear*?" She's worried. "If you really want to be a police officer, you need to get away from this *lingerie*."
"I mean, you get into acting like a fool -- and you know it. I've seen you try to act like a fool, but that was a clever ruse."
"I think I've dealt with the fuck-up already." The lieutenant turns to you. "We should probably go and talk to this guy again."
"I would also suggest that you locate your blazer with your official insignia." He points to the white rectangle on his sleeve.
"I'm afraid you can't, officer." She looks at you with sympathy. "You're just going to have to read about it in the newspaper."
"It's not a *big* scandal. Just an old corpse. All I need to do is figure out a way to get it off. Then you can *do* the rest."
"No, nothing. It's just that I found you." She gives you a light shake. "Did you come by your locker to ask what it was about?"
"On second thought, maybe there's a way to ask them here, but I don't want to get into another argument with a police officer."
"The fact that I'm a communist makes this one easy. I have a better *arrangement* with the killer. Better than you ever could."
"What a coincidence..." The lieutenant turns to the man. "That it would be of more *little* significance to the investigation."
"What can I say, it's not." She rubs her hands together. "You're just not that into *the occult* like I am. Not into it *all*."
"You are under arrest for the murder of the Revacholian ambassador. By the way, you should see the fucker in the fucking cell."
"You should be a teacher, ma'am. Have you studied the effect of your *actions* in a real-life context? What they have wrought?"
"You're not. You're part of the meat shield surroundingf the *real* fascists, while they rape children. That's what *you* are."
It's her. There's a trail of tears on the coast, and you've stepped on some. Some of them are pretty *small* clouds, however...
She has fallen back on her chair, eyes narrowed, wrists folded, fingers tapping against each other. She is impassively sitting.
"...and you fucking need an *adapter* to get out. So you can listen to this tape, will you." He slides the tape closer to you.
"But you almost got him killed too... I can't blame the living shit out of you, it's the most *hard core* thing in the world."
"I don't have time to explain it to you right now. I'm just going to ignore it for the sake of our professional relationship."
"I see." He nods. "I hear the young man is having trouble adjusting to this new reality. I helped him take his bag of rags off
"I'm glad you did. You know how it feels, just to think about some of the things you could have done. But the things I did..."
"If I knew what to do with it..." His voice echoes somewhere nearby. "But Repris was impeccably dressed. Now -- we should go."
"It's a little like you see me..." She looks at her cigarette and smiles: "Stroke this baby blue. I think I need to SAVE YOU."
"It's not possible for him to see you, however. In that case... he'll just have to be content with the pictures he's got now."
"No, he didn't." He's turning his face away from you. "He respected the sea, we all did. It was the Great Doorgunner Megamix."
"Oh, I like the *nest*. I can see where it could have come from. A military project, or perhaps an abandoned *lorenco* plant."
"Right, what do you want to know?" She looks at the clock on the wall behind the bar. The time has come to discuss the strike.
"The dead man couldn't have spoken English, or any other foreign language. He couldn't even mix the word rags with *drugs*..."
"Yes, a few of the *officers* from Precinct 41 came to see me. They had a small meeting with the head of Cuno's Union, Harry."
"Yes. It's a little ironic that the bottle you're holding is the one the Hardies were shot in. I got shot in the stomach too."
"Yes." He pauses, thoughtfully. "I shouldn't have gone in there. There's a corpse hanging there. I know all about that smell."
"You don't have to. He was no sailor -- and these are no ports. I can understand geographic fragments, but not their meaning."
"You're not a cop. You're a *pissing* asshole." He points to you. "And you don't even know what it's like to *die*. In a day."
Belying the act, he's actually telling the truth. Or at least 0.00001% of it. He has a *little* speed. He's just not giving it
He takes a sip of his beer and smiles. "They were good people, of course, but somehow their *taste* always turned against me."
She's contemplating the *Island* of Revachol 2017, where ten trillion reál would have been spent. As it is, even the jig's up.
The lieutenant looks your bleeding hands. "You get a *day* off. Two. On the two days your body says no. You should *do* that."
The supreme example of consistency is a flag that "officers" wear to school... a beachhead away from the crime scene scenario.
Thin see-through copier paper -- some neon blue, some silver-aged -- all covered in boxes and various maps. These look recent.
We're not gonna change anything here. Just put the fucking gun in your mouth and fucking shoot yourself in the mouth, alright?
What is it about this 'pissing competition' that keeps you from finding out what happens, if you turn out to be the lucky one?
Your partner, the one you were talking to, is standing right where you left off. He's got his hands on the gun, ready to fire.
"Cuno's got to be kidding. It seems like you're getting more and more desperate every day." He looks at you with disapproval.
"Detective Uuno..." She pauses to take a long, leisurely sip of tea. "I'm glad to meet you, Uuno. It's good to see you here."
"He's just a kid. Can't be trusted with anything. But you know what? When we're all dead and buried we can trust each other."
"Huh?" She says, studying the tree trunk, apparently inspecting herself for something. "Uh... *at least* *some* of the time?"
"I am a gander and a hunter and gatherer, feel like a traveller…" The man mutters to himself, accenting the beats as he goes.
"I am glad to meet you." The lieutenant nods. "I'm surprised to see you here this late. What brings you up here in the rain?"
"It's good to have, like, a body in the tree. No one will ever know what happened here, but I like the look of the dead man."
"It's not something I can take, Kim. I tried everything to live, but I can't even bend over to pick that twitching cockatoo!"
"Never, officer. I can tell this was once a proud nation. Now all we have to do is import a few more of those deserter-boys."
"Not even the most *intelligent* people in the world can manage to keep themselves together through one mess of words alone."
"Oh, my dear..." A wave of pain comes over him. "I think I just broke my neck. It's a proper reason to get out of the agony."
"The tip of the peninsula is bound to have a good view." He points to a small crack in the crum and smiles. "Let's go there."
"We have a lot in common. He's really the next man, and I believe him to be a good leader. A real force to be reckoned with."
"Well, in a way, it could be." He looks around and starts laughing again. "So, are you gonna quit writing that stupid stuff?"
"What are you talking about, 'you're under'? This is serious. You've lost your gun. I've found it, traced it to the authors."
"What's really funny is..." Another pause. "If I were to walk further into the site, my heart would be in a different place."
"You look like a mega-secret spy, right? I've heard about your *deep connections*... I'd like to see if they fit this bunch."
(Point to the dead body.) "We should look for the lead before we start digging. This isn't gonna work well without the iron."
A few days go by, the signs of the struggle are gone. The only sounds are the snow falling on the riverbank, the wind blowing
Good. That's actually how you feel, doesn't it? You've done something as a *child* today... you have to take this personally.
Military aid from abroad -- particularly from the Iilmaraan people. They make up for it with commercially available weaponry.
That's all it took! That was such an uper. You were looking for a pattern, searching for any clues, the only thing you got...
You are instantly surprised by the speed of the reaction. It feels like the entire incident is just playing out in your head.
You sense the trajectory of the little piece of metal and plastic, the object disappearing between the sandwich and the rack.
"Ah, yes, the existence of the law is a matter of great importance to Revachol. It is the foundation of our economic order."
"I don't know what you do for a living, but I can't just go on autopilot like that! I don't have the *" *boule* for that..."
"I think she has a terrible husband. Very depressing. She leaves her husband when they go on long term, leaving the family."
"I'm curious to hear what happens to the others. Will their time here come to a close. Will they come down with the plague?"
"I'm not worried at all," he says in a soft voice. "I mean look at you. In thirty-five, you're already on top of the world."
"I'm sorry, dear. You've had to drudge through them so many times. Such is field work -- a young person's game as they say."
"Is it?" She looks up at the towering structure. "Glad to have been of assistance -- the little that I know. Anything else?"
"It's just a law officer asking around. Stating things, checking that shit is on." She doesn't even look up after you leave.
"It's just... a *mush of things* in the back of the church." (Look into the bushes) "I wonder what it has -- leaves in '06?"
"It's totally possible. Just remain awake. Apologize to *me*! I'm sorry, man, I am a shitty dad. I got completely under it."
"No, don't think I *are* doing that..." The lieutenant taps on his cigarette. He gets up, faces covered with the sweatshirt.
"No, no, no, no, no. It's good. Really. I mean what I said to you -- I didn't think any less of you, Harry. You're a champ!"
"Of course, sweetie, I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't over-do it. For one -- it's pretty heavy too -- but fine."
"Okay, it's not an issue. It's just -- the tequila is probably making some *really* here. The Ghost Pepper! Ghost Pepper..."
"Stop looking into what?" There's a clunky moment of silence where the lieutenant is looking behind him, but then he speaks:
"Sweetie, I'm sorry, but I think you need more help than I can give you." She looks distressed and even a little frightened.
"The Whirling is listed on the intercom outside. As one of the businesses in Building B -- of *The Doomed Commercial Area*."
"They could be lying if they wanted -- that's why--" He gestures to his rifle, then to the woman. "Let's check his pockets."
"This beer?" He raises his eyebrows. "I have to ask -- what can *you* do for me in this fizzy drink?" (Give him the bottle.)
"This is the *system*. This is what the system does. We've managed to turn this place into a quasi-autonomous police force."
"We tried to interview her, but she asked us to do something for her first. Boy, did we find some bombshells along the way."
"We're all for freedom of speech, but..." He raises his hand, slowly. "C'mon, man, we're serious. We're serious about this."
"You're right Lizzie. No one is coming. Only the both of you are staying here." She looks around. "This apartment is large."
Looking at the faint traces of her perfume, like aflower blossoms without any petals. Her perfume, as you say it, is unique.
Perhaps you could combine your psionic energy with the *weapons* you've got, trying to confuse and overwhelm the lieutenant.
What? No! The urge is too strong... it's *harder* than ever before. You're burning up in her presence. She's scattering you.
"*My* husband's dead body is behind the store and the door in the kitchen is *unopenable* so you can't go back through it."
"He can't do that. But... he was a fugitive too. This was his territory -- this was a matter of national security for him."
"Hey, I'm not the only one who wants to change the subject..." She crosses her arms. "Talk to him, see what he has to say."
"I am quite certain." She hands you a spool of paper. "All three of these are reusable, and can be recycled as ammunition."
"I hope you're doing well, Jack," the lieutenant says, suddenly worried. "You look like the most charming cop in Revachol."
"I just need to get through this intersection, just like I would in most places. I don't need to do it in a *natural* way."
"I wouldn't. I have no idea what I would. I don't even want to read the rules now..." She turns her eyes to the book shelf.
"It's my duty as a police officer to preserve order and prevent the use of excessive force. And that's exactly what I did."
"Just so you know..." He considers your statement. "All this stuff is just smoke and mirrors. And I'm not a smoke-peddler."
"Oh, I can understand that, I'm used to people being mean. Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong person. That might explain it."
"Thank you. Thank you for not doing some *glorious* detective work. I'm glad you weren't trying to steal anything from us."
"The fuck are you still doing?" The voice from the radio interferes again. "Our *friend* is a *crab man*, you stupid fuck!"
"The old man sent word you'd would be around again. That's the reason I'm being so forthcoming with ya. Don't wear it out."
"The tree is just used as a camouflage backdrop for heavy artillery. I want you to feel its weight on your shoulders, cop."
"When we're done we're going to have to set up the Festival. When that's done you're going to be able to do the Promenade."
"Yeah, fuck me." He shakes his head. "Fuck you, I'm gonna fucking kill myself. That's my weapon here -- for now. Fuck you."
"Yes yes, like a deck of cards..." He turns to Titus. "The point is, this *allegorical* Kim should've just told the truth."
"You were so drunk, you didn't remember what it was. There was also the näkky smell, the strange mushrooms. And the sound."
And it's *only* a matter of minutes to a week to reach a settlement... but the people are stupid. The numbers don't add up.
The lieutenant nods. "Let's get going. This is a police matter, so don't let it get *out of hand*. And I'll be right back."
There's a pause. "I'm sure we can find a tape player," he responds, taking a drag, "but that's a subject for another time."
This is a great way to pass the time on the road. In your head: "Hey, what should I do, but *more*? More is better, right?"
You're right. The gun is. Your honour-preserver. Nothing more, nothing to be ashamed of. And hey -- look at the other hats!
"A better deal! Yeaaaaaah!" He waves his hand in the air. "Harder core!" The words echo magnificently throughout the nave.
"And we saw your attempt to shoot the dead guy down from the tree. That was an... impressive failure, if I say so myself."
"And you thought we might have found it?" (Point to his eyes.) "That's what a drunk pig is, he really loves the camera..."
"And you're right... I need it to *help* us get the other team here. I need to solve this case! If you have it with me..."
"I can't. This man was no sailor -- and these are no ports. I can understand geographic fragments, but not their meaning."
"I could have put it there, like all the rest of this is a pile of shit. But I think I'm better off opening the... doors."
"I will remain pure and humble. Only the most beautiful of all queens. I will guide it with empathy, authority and grace."
"I'm still not. I'm just a random cop who happens to be passing through. I would never intentionally do anything immoral."
"It's just a matter of *doing* it. It's like that *thing* in the back of the club... I can't even begin to describe it..."
"It's not. This is a war." He looks to the sea. "Sooner or later everyone is gonna die. This is the beginning of the end."
"Kim was an extreme individualist and anti-authoritarian sorry cop," he says. "He was promoting lawlessness and violence."
"No, you don't get to choose your posse, they choose you. Mine are idiots, but they do not understand what justice means."
"No." He studies the lieutenant. "It's not *very* high-concept. It's about assembly line products. Like a butcher's shop."
"Of course, you're doing your job. I'm just glad you didn't get in the way of any immoral or illegal antiquities dealers."
"Oh yes... there seems to be a bit more to this story we still have to tell." He looks around, his face red from the cold.
"Oh, the spirit..." He nods. "It's very cool how they can adapt and evolve with the times. It's not *cool* per se, but..."
"The Union had to put them together. A group of local big wigs put the pieces together. They're great guys," he concludes.
"The weapon you have could be the one that shoots him. We should check it out -- it's not just the city, it's a *terror*."
"They're all just like you -- little cross-hatching on the back of their foreheads. Not *wacky* or *girly* or anything..."
"Thorpe's been nothing but a regular soldier, a Vietnam Vet. Always on duty in the National Guard, always ready to fight."
"Yeah," he says, shaking his head, "Cuno's not fucking choking, *bro*. He's fucking *healthy*. Cuno's a *physical* beast."
"You're right. The hatch is always open." He looks at the connector. "It's just that the connector looks kind of small..."
He is not completely off. He still believes the lorries attempted to bribe him. It's just a *pretense* to get him talking.
No, it's not that... it's the fact that the *human race* is a social construct, and your 'normal' is a social construct...
She cracks her knuckles and cocks her head to your side. "I'll take it from here. Then we can *tape* it, back to reality?"
That's comforting to hear. Now if we could somehow get you to divulge precisely where the last row of cells was located...
The man looks at you, then at the queen, then at his wife: "There's something I need to get from you... from both of you."
"But, yes -- the bomber. The authorities found him, but he was too sick to tell us about it... so we can't say anything."
"I can't. This man was no sailor -- and these are no ports. I can understand geographic patterns, but not their meaning."
"I was able to re-contextualize it as a dark joke." He pauses. "I will not be able to re-contextualize it the next time."
"I'm going to write a letter to the mayor, explaining what I think of this... So that you don't waste more of your time."
"It's a little late to go on a *date* right now, but..." The lieutenant stops midway -- then lets it all out with a sigh.
"Oh, no, of course I'm talking about Marc. Marc is a real sweet fella, he is. Marc isn't a violent man. He's a good man."
"The Cuno's gonna beat the cinderblock fuck out of his face." He picks at his cigarette and rolls it between his fingers.
"Wait, no one's fucking it..." He looks at you and breathes his lungs out: "I mean, I don't give a shit if that's yours!"
"Yeah, we do it all the time here, man, nah, it just doesn't stick. And the chill only lasts a while, even..." She sighs.
"Yeah... I can't... believe I just said that. I don't love you, Kim. That's a lie. You're nothing to me, you're a toy..."
"Yes, the legend has it that you will be attacked by a pack of wild wolves, and your *boule* will be caught in the hunt."
"You're right, officer. You're not going to find this place's weakness in this book. It's... a *classic* lawman's setup."
A cool shower of water rushes to wash away the sweat from your brow. Someone closes the door, turning the lights back on.
The hands of some ancient and powerful dragon, sweeping over the land... you feel like you're in some kind of fairy tale.
The man with the large head nods gravely. "Well. Well. This just in: we are *the* cop who killed him. It's the hard cop."
Your official sidearm, issued by the Revachol Citizens Militia, is the only thing keeping this man from taking his death.
"Ah, a fellow history buff -- I, myself, am currently reading up on Franconigerian era trains. Very interesting stuff. "
"Both are alike. The man is a giant cockatoo, the bird is a giant cockatoo. They both eat *nothing* but their own kind."
"Fuck, I don't know..." She looks around. "I don't know what to say. Your drunk-date is probably still on the line, no?"
"I can't get inside the church. It's just too long..." He looks around. "I'm gonna have to do it the old fashioned way."
"I can't really remember. We were just discussing the new building project we'd been kicking around for the last month."
"If you need any further assistance you can visit us on the corner of Voyager and Main. Are we done with the jokes now?"
"It's a good thing you came to the RCM. I've been getting a lot of complaints from people who've done odd things here. "
"It's not a deal." She takes a drag of her cigarette. "You want the key to the city? Sure. You got it. You are the key."
"It's not just the sales, or the investments. My investment also includes a percentage of the company's future profits."
"Look, I don't think *anyone* has attempted to create an *interisolary* game before. We just don't have the technology."
"Of course. I sympathize. But I'm afraid I just can't do it with you, because you're not a person whom I could talk to."
"Oh yes, officer. I'm extremely sorry I couldn't be with you today. I hope you find your way through your own troubles."
"So that was *really* what happened? That you took the shot that killed him?" He taps his chin, thinking of the old man.
"The dead man -- any of you know the drill? How about you keep your head up and just cut his throat like you always do?"
"There is no heat and light. If you try to *drink* while wearing these, it will make you... *not* the man with the gun."
"This is an old road, it's been well-maintained for many decades. It's not a major thoroughfare. Please don't go there."
"What do you mean by *"I'm not the law"? Are you trying to incriminate yourself, or are you just... ambiguously *busy*?"
"Yes." The lieutenant nods vigorously. "He's an interesting piece. Could use some real *revelation*, like we have here."
"You don't have to talk about it right now. You don't have to talk about any of it. Now we're just going to stand here."
There's a moment's silence before the man leans forward and whispers: "Fuck the system, man. Fuck this. Fuck this shit."
"A great way to go about opening these presents, I agree. All important in the spiritual quest we both must embark on."
"A minute and a half later, Soltys stopped by their car, some mysterious mercenary leaving the carcass of the truck..."
"Fuck me. I'm done with this fascinating sleuthing shit. I'm done with the *mourning shit* and the *mystery shit* too."
"Hey, they're a human being. We're not dealing with a bunch of mutually exclusive stereotypes here. I'm observing you."
"I am glad to hear that your friend is still alive," he says, taking another sip. "But what about the other residents?"
"I don't know..." He turns his mouth to the one side and stares into it silently, his forehead wrinkling from the wind.
"I don't want to sit here and watch you idiot *drank* water out of this river. I want to get up and clean the streets."
"I haven't seen any *cryptologists* around here, though -- surely there are people who are more *cryptologic* than me."
"Is that because you have to cover your ass *all* the time, you *cant*? And now I see no one's even *hunting* for you."
"No, he's not. Or maybe he is, I don't know. I'm not a *police officer*, I'm an expert in identifying the *difficult*."
"That doesn't change our stance, however." He looks out toward the lights. "Hey -- why am I looking at this? Let's go."
"There's a *lot* of it too." He nods. "We need to talk about it. Who watches over him there while I come back for you."
"Yes. But that's what makes it so peculiar. The bears are stubborn. They won't be budging even if they get the chance."
If you miss your opportunity to turn the RCM into a modern military force, this may be the time to start looking again.
It's a magnificent sight -- the tall, draped figure of a woman, with her hair parted, her face concealed behind a veil.
The bayou brought in by the engineering behind the building. A water lock washers, used to move the generator upstairs.
The man gives you a sideways glance, but then smiles and points to the wall. "It's a bit more organized than the rest."
"...that's the way I feel. You've been keeping me in the dark. For the last 20 years now. Easing me out of the world."
"Aye. About Klaasje's connection to the Union -- I'm sure she's *totally* over it, man. So -- you got questions then?"
"I'm on the coast, in Jamrock, in Revachol... I don't think I have any more to tell you about the city of Revachol..."
"I'm sorry it was a stupid joke." The lieutenant puts his hand on the back of his head and looks out across the water.
"It's no problem at all. You need no introductions," she smiles. "My name is Ulla Eklund and this is Evelyn Ouimette."
"No, you're right, babe. I'm just a third-year project manager here on the team. I don't have to do the *hard* stuff."
"The next time you see him -- tell him how much it meant to be the man. Then turn his brains into a whole new person."
"There were lots of stray dogs wandering around. They did me good. I'm not angry enough to say I was afraid of attack.
"We're all scraping up any happiness we can find, officer. Going around with our little scabs -- hunting down cops..."
"What else are you going to do then? The strike already made things more difficult? I already agreed to talk to them."
"Yes, but imagine a mushroom -- capped with a devil-may-fire? How would you stop? Then you'd have a massive fire gut."
"You've been here for a long time. Did you know the place was abandoned just a short distance from the main entrance?"
...while the sun is still up in the east, her heart is beating. In the tiny pulse of happiness she puts the book away.
LORD" is the only word that comes to mind. "Her Majesty's Majesty the Queen is a woman of the house. She's the law..."
Now, this makes him look *definitely* cool. It's not exactly *unlike* him, you getting to choose your posse like this.
The lieutenant puts his hand on the door handle. "I know its name: *Unsatisfied*. I just heard the name of the label."
This rigidity is so very industrial it would be almost impolite to suggest otherwise. Yet here it is again, smiling...
"A man walks into a hole like the one you just got into. And then sees smoke rise, all over him. ... Just like that."
"Ah, yes, I was thinking about you." The lieutenant is smiling now. "Do the things you want to do make you feel sad?"
"Don't be. It's just a factory. It's a *dance* factory. There's *nothing* to it. Just a factory. A background noise."
"Hmm..." The lieutenant looks at the man before you. "This guy does not look like a criminal. He's a police officer."
"Hold on, the graffito has been painted over the traces of the lynching, but the painting is still very much intact."
"I see you're being modest, René," he says with a sly smile. "I like it. You know how it is to be good for the Cuno."
"I'm afraid we have no idea, officer. If I were to ask, I would be like you -- paranoid and lost in my own thoughts."
"It's not like you two are *dating*. That can't be further from the truth. It's a joke. A *fantastic* time, officer."
"No one believes me. I can't see the ball with my own eyes. It was like this -- me, your glasses, and your *vision*."
"No, not my boyfriend. What you mean is... no one's okay with *bald* men getting on the ladies' good side. I get it."
"No, there aren't. Some little shit and his dad are doing speed. Boo-fucking-hoo. The stuff's probably from Jamrock."
"Oh, nothing critical of the beauties of the world, you know." She puts out her cigarette. "So, what's on your mind?"
"Right there," he points at the cardboard block of recycled paper. "The top of the mountain. The flat of the valley."
"They are a perfect match for my *Motorcycle*. It's got a V12, a big fan, and a place in the centre of the pavement."
"Yeah, you're right. The man with the sunglasses is the one with the glasses. I wasn't able to get a good picture..."
"Yes. You're Black-Out-Sail. You're one of them. All three are better than the last time. Let's try to be more even."
"You are not *dead*, officer. I should probably ask about some more *boots*, because we could use some better boots."
"You mean he killed his friends or something? *Yeah* I guess he did though -- you're just *too* good for *that* guy."
A crooked little smile. "Can't forget -- if it works, it sticks. And if it doesn't..." A sad smile. "Good bye then. "
A man in his late thirties. Thin and bespectacled. He's a master of his trade, as though he himself is a *detective*.
He nods. "I had my doubts -- there were no signs of a struggle on his hands. No claw marks on his neck. But still..."
She smiled. "Okay, fine. You're a cop. You can't let a little old lady make your life any harder than it already is."
The lieutenant doesn't even have to look at you. He takes a long sip from his coffee. It's a little sad in his veins.
The lieutenant glances at you and makes a note. "I'll keep the handcuffs here. You want to deal with these yourself?"
The lieutenant takes a sip of his coffee. "You're the best detective in the world, Harry! I've said it enough times."
"And you're a giant cockatoo. That cockatoo can't fly!" He points to himself with his index finger. "You can't fly."
"Cuno knows this shit. Cuno knows all of this shit." He looks around in the room. "It's fucking boring, that's all."
"Eighth, yes. That was the last job I took, for some reason. The hash-house owner said you'd be spotted in a month."
"Goddamnit, that's it? That's all you've got -- *Dark Eye* set on you? That's your old hooker girl sticking around?"
"Hey, you're not only the detective, you're the one who asked for the boots. How about the other one get shot, too?"
"I don't know what that means, Harry." He looks confused. "But that's how you read this story. The more the better."
"I don't want to. I must remain vigilant. If he started giving information to the police, it would only rattle him."
"I have a strong sense of responsibility for this..." he says, then looks around. "I should have gone there sooner."
"I'm a police officer," he explains. "I'm not going to make excuses for it. I would never do anything *weird* here."
"I'm all out of *beer* now, my dear. A bottle. Not worth more than 1%. I will be the most drunk I can be right now."
"It'll be impossible to open this container now, you just have to hurry on." He puts the tool back into his toolbox.
"Lieutenant, I'm not a big fan of *black* crime. I'm afraid I can't handle the ruffians in this..." He looks around.
"Of course, officer." She smiles politely. "Is there a particular cryptid you two are interested in learning about?"
"Stop squealing on yourself. You didn't lose. You're alive." He looks to the white shadow, then to the black shadow.
"That might have been a good idea, yes..." He points north. "Why not. You guys really know where we can get canned."
"The *wild*?" The man keeps winking at you, his head even paler than before. It's not a fight. It's an honor attack.
"The defendant is a familiar name. Many of the Hardie boys have a *pattern* to them. I suppose it looks *official*."
"There's something in me that tells me to be sceptical if there's a dead body, alright? Might be a personal matter."
"This is *fascinating*, mister..." He seems excited about the new information. "It almost gives me the legs for it."
"We're not dumb, lieutenant. We know what we have to do and we're *all* in this together!" He pushes up his glasses.
"Yes." She turns to her husband. "She's at the hospital. I don't need her for assistance. Take her to the hospital."
"You're right -- we probably *did*." The man looks at you. "We're just gonna have to take care of that thing now..."
A man in a blue bomber jacket leans on his turret-like top-of-the-line machine. A cannon is aimed at the man's head.
A man like her has to deal with a lot of people. Even in the course of their work, sometimes they're mistaken for...
Better not to dwell on it too long, because you know -- when you do, there's a good chance the bonus will evaporate.
Don't forget your badge, you're in charge here. The door has been left unlocked, but you are not a police officer...
Oh, but he *is*. Because of a *special condition*, made worse by the death. He doesn't *want* a death to befall him.
She's not in the business of *public indecency*, so let's move along, may the feline intelligence guard protect you.
That would definitely help, but not to the point of having to leave the building. You feel you'd be better for that.
The lieutenant is relieved. "Did you get your wish, Harry? He's probably going to be a real good policeman one day."
The man looks at you, then at the tree, then at the sand. "Sure thing, my friend. I'm still listening to the radio."
The wind picks up and the street narrows: the street lights have started to shift. The air starts to stir, sluggish.
What a fascinating idea! Could this be your chance to show off to your comrades the world of science and technology?
You do? What happened to your brain, officer? What was your *brain* doing when you started drinking? Couldn't you...
You pick up the handset. There's a tone. Sounds like a warm cup of coffee. There's a photo of you -- and it's *you*.
"Don't be silly, sir." She wavers under your gaze, mouth pressed into a tight-lipped frown... then she breaks down:
"He's in his room, in the bathroom. He has access to the bathroom. I can see it all. With the key in the ignition."
"I found a small box in my closet. It's crashed to hell. I'm going to use it for a *luke-la-Clef* album, for sure."
"I keep thinking it's *worth* it, sir -- it's great fun for all ages, but it's mostly just a way to prance around."
"I'll tell you, this feels like an *insane* situation. A huge, massive, *incredible* failure, I'm happy to report."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't have been *all* of it. I *fucked* up too. I should have..." He stops and sighs. "I'm sorry."
"I'm sorry, man. I was just trying to be tactful. A lost gun is a dangerous thing. I'm not a lover of the extreme."
"I'm trying to understand that radio. Seven years of being sober now, I think. It's the last great angst hangover."
"It's not *hard*. You just have to be *in* the club. You'll find the time in the morning. Three hours, maybe four."
"No, it wasn't!" She drops the microphone. "It's just a mumble, I'm not the worst kind of cop. I'm a great mumble."
"No-no." The lieutenant is quick to correct him. "He's not missing for *three* days. We're tracing his steps here."
"Oh yes. Cancer really is bad," he says. "The problem is almost always the same -- the metastases are complicated."
"The man must have been very familiar with the *antlers*... sitting by that doorway for too long is her signature."
"This is not the building that was torpedoed during the landing. No, a different ship was used. A much bigger one."
"We have a credible lead, sir. Someone on this roundabout -- or on the island -- was shot. We need to investigate."
"What is this? You're trying to cut it? I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks so. All signs point to *nothing*."
"What's this video commercial for, in a clinic for cancer? It's a medical joke. That's the department's specialty."
"Yeah, well, I'm gonna give the lads at their door a miss," the lieutenant says to herself. "He has my shitcapped."
"You know what I have in mind, yes? A giant inferno, fueled by psy-kinetic energy. Well, it's going to be a blast."
"You mean why's she like that?" The girl looks around. "What the fuck? You're drunk, then too drunk to remember..."
"You'll see. When the rains come in, the road will disappear under the water, it will no longer be a place at all."
"You're right, I'm just going to go and talk to her right now..." He pinches the trigger. "When she's ready to go."
A faint smell of burning rubber reaches your nostrils. A brief flash of electric lights reveals a squat metal door.
A small piece of the dead man's hair sticks out from the tufts of hair on the skull. His hair is black and tangled.
A thick stack of books hangs from the shelves, broken into small boxes -- the smell dissipates into a musky breeze.
And when you look into his eyes, his pupil-size hood, with a gold-and-pink bow tie -- the bullet hole in his cheek.
She looks down for a moment, then waves her hands in the air impatiently. "Okay... then it's gonna be another one?"
The jelly-like deep-sea gloop comes to a stop. Some of it creep across her body, like pebbles. Her eyes are closed.
The lieutenant is not going to come to the island for the *art exhibit* any time soon. He's too busy with the case.
The lieutenant's right. It's a grey, storm-stricken sky, with a small cluster of bright orange stars at its centre.
The shell lies on the ground, vacant and forgotten. The handprints across the surface almost seem to go on forever.
You see: a broken bottle opener, a rusty old coin collection tray, and an old uniform he's tossed out like garbage.
"A body is only creative for its ability to manipulate others. What did you know about the dead man's *skullery*?"
"A well executed *graffito* -- if you will. On the desk, on the front, everywhere. I'm even more grateful for it."
"Can't be certain it's a *horse*? Or even *some* of the other models on the set. I don't know. It's just a guess."
"Central nervous system," he says and then concludes abruptly: "I have nothing. Do you have anything on this man?"
"How I hope you'll manage the situation..." She looks you in the eye. "I hope it's as difficult as the last time."
"I don't know what that means." She turns to face the sea, slowly. Her grey eyes follow the contours of the water.
"I got some more money from some money-lender here. I don't know what to say, I don't have any money, just money."
"I'm glad you're still standing tall, officer. I don't think I could have done it without you..." He looks around.
"It's a *reality* show, man. They're not *real* people. They're an example. The people they're trying to emulate."
"It's not about cutting the belt, not about who runs the drug trade -- that's the whole premise of the operation."
"It's not the first time that he's been drunk. But the last time -- those days do not *reign* -- it's *de facto*."
"Maybe... just one time. I'm not worried..." The woman's face stiffens as she takes the photo and hands it to you.
"No, I'm not. I'm sorry, but that's not the point. The point is the contact mic is hidden inside the transmitter."
"Of course," he nods, grinning. "How else do you know? The bust is probably just a romanticized depiction anyway."
"Okay, but I'd like to know..." Something that gives the old man some comfort, if only to keep his wits about his.
"One thing is for certain: this is a *revolutionary*-era weapon. Do you know if it has been fired during the War?"
"RIGHT TO WORK!" He seems to have returned to his previous routine, as if he'd never seen the photo of the tattoo.
"That's right." The lieutenant is looking at the block diagram. "We will assume this is a good moment to proceed."
"There must be a reason anyone's trying to be *evil* in this situation. Otherwise, why would this prison rioting?"
"Yeah, Cuno's got one too. Cuno's dad is a fucking f****t who does speed. Cuno's dad is a fucking *speed* addict."
"Yeah, like you said, pig, that's some shit." He looks south, the way you came. "Somewhere *behind* the Whirling."
"Yes. It's so hard to say what it *is* about. Hard to say what it's worth. In the end it's what *you* pay for it."
"You just can't keep your mouth shut about the world around you, unless you're hiding something *very important*."
"You may still call me Fortress Accident. Because this place is *totally* abandoned." (Point at the empty church.)
"You tried to punch a twelve year-old and almost knocked him out," the lieutenant reports. "I think I'm reckless."
(Whispers.) "No. Let me tell you something else... if it *is* your fault, what would you do with a broken person?"
Beneath the mirthless exterior the old man is a bit disappointed he didn't get to use his carabine or his toolbox.
Is it by swerve turn? Fake you in late defense to cross since head spool.Slow manufactured missing down defense...
Right. You're a bad ass cop. Logic dictates such cops do not arrest young men. This should be (almost) impossible.
The drawer is locked, blue ink drips from the white pages in your hand. It's empty, except for a folded newspaper.
The lieutenant looks back. The red headed woman looks forlorn, as she lets her eyes linger on the decaying figure.
The wind picks up here, near the cape's end, near the buildings lining the route. It's cold for this time of year.
There is no sudden, profound, sweeping change to the way the world is managed. Things remain exactly as they were.
"ALSO -- IT HAPPENED ONCE, MAN. YOU SAPPEN TO ME. IT IS INTELLECTUALLY YOU. I APPEAR TO HAVE RETURNED TO LONDON."
"C'mon, detective," the lieutenant breaks his silence. "Now's not the time to be going through personal affects."
"Cuno's got shit to deal with and not a fucking napoleon." He lets out a long sigh. "I can get off my ass, Cuno."
"Don't ask for whom it was, it's not going anywhere, you're not going anywhere. I haven't seen anyone out there."
"I guess we should let it slide since it's not really our job to find the answer. But still -- one more question.
"I may have only myself, but it struck me as a *well-phased* idea. They had a *financial incentive* to kill him."
"I would suggest something to the contrary, officer. Thanks for clearing that up. But you're still welcome here."
"I'm going to the island -- on holiday. I have to report my lost gun. And I have to pay for my room in Kvalsund."
"I'm sorry, it was rude of me to mention the wheelchair. The waiter has been more than helpful, so I'm grateful."
"It's definitely a square. About the size of a city block. Girls remember the square toe. Girls have a square..."
"It's out of this. It shall come back to this world or heaven is just a vision, but right now it's between us..."
"Look, officer..." He turns to Summer Schaffer, the former cop and television personality of the opening variety.
"No one's ever been afraid of the truth, Harry." He laughs. "Ask any of your friends here. They'll laugh at you."
"No problem whatsoever, sir." She smiles mischievously. "He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"No, no," he says, shuffling his legs. "I've experienced more than that. My experience is *better* than yours..."
"No," she says firmly. "I didn't *ask* for it. It was simply the best way to let the situation be. No other way."
"No. I'm not a *light* smoker. I just want to be able to sleep awake every night without worrying about my skin."
"Of course, officer," he says quickly. "Was there a particular cryptid you two are interested in learning about?"
"The fuck is with you, City guy? Cuno's gotta protect the Cuno name." He looks you up and down, then back at you.
"There was a painting inside. You know, a blue-eyed boy with sunglasses on. Sunglasses -- like a cop would wear."
"To me, you're a fairy tale character. A man with a fork in a world of soup. I like trying to be the best I can."
"What are you trying to mean -- *get* to me? Why are you trying to get to me? Don't *call* me! GET ON THE GROUND!
"What?" He looks at you, his eyes full of confusion. "But what *are* we doing? We should get back to our *idea*."
"Yeah, I don't need any money. I'm not the richest man in the world, I just look a bit rich, but that's just me."
"Yes -- and you should go back to the station and report your badge missing. This is clearly an area of concern."
"Yes." He takes the tape player out from the box, and hands it back to you. "And with your permission I will show
"You know, to put it bluntly, no one is ever going to be able to take me seriously with that kind of leadership."
"You're right, officer -- we haven't been communicating with this Cuno. I'm sorry. He's been gone for a while..."
****Cuno's on the shit. Cuno's on the best shit. It's unecosystemic shit, but the whole stratosphere is fucked.'"
And when that time comes, you will be on your way. Someday, when you are ready to begin your proper retirement...
He looks at you, then at Trant. "Do you understand? This is the continuation, not the cancellation, of the show."
If some alien cryptid turns up on the island, with no one there to recognize them, it's probably not the phasmid.
She's not surprised to be recognized, rather sad. Something passes over her face before she straightens her back.
This thought brings him to his senses. "You're right... I still haven't got the right people to sign a contract."
"Actually, you're not a bad person. The police is a corrupt institution, but that doesn't mean I don't serve the
"Disco music? What's that?" She looks around. "I don't have any of that jazz music, I just listen to this shit."
"Do you remember what the Indymedia was, I'm guessing you did *not* call it the *Indymedia*?" She sounds amused.
"Fuck you, Cuno..." The kid looks around, then to the fridge. "You asked too much. Cuno doesn't care about you."
"He said it was an honour killing. Hussar style. The Zsiemsk community protested the trial, flying the colours."
"He's definitely somebody we've met before. I met him, I know who I am. I remember just being in our escort posi
"I don't have a lot of money, but that doesn't mean I can't have fun with it. Just don't do anything *extreme*."
"I know of students who have recently *already* passed. It's not usually that way. It's easy, though, isn't it?"
"No. This is a *culinary* moment, you know. We're in this together -- I've got your back, I've got your back..."
"Of course it did." She shrugs. "I'm proud of you, though you're probably headed through *a lot* of pain *now*."
"Of course." His eyes bend towards the distance. "I would never turn that on over dinner. Does that bother you?"
"The fuck *are* you doing?" His voice is calm for a moment, but it gets even calmer once Ruby shows him her gun.
"Well, a day will come, officer. When it comes... but not now. There's more things to do. We need to *do* this."
"Yes, the Entity, he said you said. He's on the side of the cinderblock. He's blocking the way to the mainland."
"Yes. I'm the North's most famous and most hated criminal. I have *all* the *restest* of the world at my mercy."
"You are not the first. I've seen it every since the infant days -- the scabs of the fallen. And now it's here."
His grip is strong and well-worn. "I'm not afraid of investment. It's all awesome. I just really like robots..."
No answer; he's still staring at you, his hair covered in blue tattoos, seemingly oblivious to your predicament.
The giant stick insect. The reeds whisper a.k.a. *leeches* at you. It's as though something is born to *eat* it.
The lieutenant nods, understanding the situation, and hands you the sandwich. "Please... just take it, alright?"
There's a note of disappointment in her voice, as she misses the opportunity to laud the virtues of colonialism.
What do you do? Every second you spend here is a new expense lined up in your ledger. There will be a reckoning.
You really, really should have a gun in your hand by now -- or, worst case scenario, just try to trick yourself.
"And of course I should add," she continues, rubbing her face, "I *am* a police officer. I was born into it..."
"And what do you think even this...?" She's still looking for it. "The police? That's what I would like to do."
"Beats me." She shrugs. "I've used to them -- for example, he did not seem hell-bent on my return. A *Texter*."
"I agree," the lieutenant replies, his eyes never leave the sunken vehicle. "We should definitely investigate."
"I am worried about not only the corpse, but also the context in which it is displayed. The symbolism and all."
"I have a major problem," she replies with a smile and nods. "It's addiction. I'm struggling to do what I can."
"I have to be on my best behaviour, detective -- if I come up short, I'm gonna get the short end of the stick."
"I knew that, but still..." He looks at himself in the mirror. "We need to talk to Histoire about the uniform."
"I knew you'd get it, Titus." He nods confidently. "I'm not a fucking *bencher*, Harry. I actually *am* a cop."
"I'm not." She makes this face: one million million years ago. The face of a young girl, just learning to walk.
"I'm sorry, officer, I don't understand. I should have known what *I* was doing. I shouldn't have been here..."
"It was just a joke, sweeter than I imagined, *and* I still can't believe he's still *there*, it's *impolite*."
"It's a solid point. He may have been unconscious from a previous gunshot wound -- and thus not incapacitated."
"Later." He looks into the container: "The boat is halfway done. If you don't keep it in, it will be too late."
"No, you didn't *actually* do it. You were just *playing* around. What you really did was *piss* yourself off."
"Of course. I understand. But... you're not the only one who has issues." There's a motherly hint to her voice.
"Stop squealing on yourself. You did the right thing." He looks down at the ground. "You got the wrong number."
"The Accord is a *fictional* product from the '30s, but it's *legally* identical to the one we have right now."
"There's no need for caution, lieutenant. You see, I have a *complex* theory about that missing locust head..."
"Wishful thinking has no place in a police investigation," the lieutenant tells Alain, his voice mild but firm.
"Yes, I'm not a *regular* detective. I am a cop of the law, investigating *legends* and missing persons cases."
"Yes. It is *definitely* because of his leg. But *also* -- I've seen it in his eyes. He's afraid for his life."
He looks at you, obviously annoyed by the interruption. "Good call, officer. I'm sure you remember the saying."
He's wearing a blueish shirt and a pair of green track pants. You would never see him from here... but still...
Small metal plating slides out of its nest where it has been hiding. It has a flavor of seaweed and rain on it.
The noise of the harbour rushes back. You feel like an amateur. How do you hold the mic? Does it go up or down?
You know, it's also time to get a little *shy* about the way you've got that cool jacket on. Is it *that* cool?
"Antwerp -- *418* -- an industrial port doubled back by a newly updated transatlantic link. From '41 onwards."
"Good, I've unlocked the production schedule. After ending the call please press PLAY to access the filament."
"Good. We have a murder weapon in the weapon's nest." The lieutenant points to the slit. "This is a good one."
"I found you, sir. Good, good, you in the end..." She puts the rifle back to her shoulder and closes her eyes.
"I should have seen it." He looks north, over the crumbling balustrade. "There's no way I can take this case."
"I'll tell you what -- it's a *totally* bizarre game. You're *literally* making a *totally* bizarre choice..."
"I'm a big fan of this game. It's extremely well done. It's like the Persona games, except *I* am the police."
"I'm sure. Well, they *promote* their own version of gender equality. One that's more* equal than the others."
"In the late seventies he got a new girlfriend, and they got engaged. He had a kid and a house to run with..."
"It wasn't, Harry." The lieutenant looks up from his notes. "This is pretty much a *sniper's nest*, you know."
"It's just a little thing. Sometimes a man just wants to know the real *story* of his life. No more, I guess."
"It's just the way it is." He looks around with a bored expression. "But, nevertheless, that's the way it is."
"It's not just a store, I already explained that. I already *explained* that we are on the coast of Revachol."
"No. The fact is, this *is* a murder investigation. It's like a *suspect* pull-out, but then we keep going..."
"Please stop. This is taking place in a hostel dormitory of the Air Force. We have to treat them differently."
"The triall is the cornerstone of our national identity. It's what distinguishes us from the rest of mankind."
"This is good to hear." She looks at her bag. "It's been nice talking to you, if I don't interrupt you, okay?"
"We *know* his face and we know who's really at fault for his death." She looks down, back into her cigarette.
"We're all in this together. I can't imagine what would happen if the whole world was just *on* our doorstep."
"We've already done a lot of talking. Let's be honest: The *I* am the jurisdiction's most dangerous criminal."
"What?" The lieutenant's eyes are wide with disbelief. "A police officer has a *lot* to learn about evidence."
A switch has suddenly been flipped on the side of the projector. The switch is marked *OFF* by the power cord.
He takes issue with your having to *concee* this information, suggesting you work with the local *GOVERNMENT*.
Just one piece of photographic material remains. There is no other photographic medium, no *double negatives*.
Nothing changes in her tone as she continues: "Can you believe it?" "Can I forget it?" "Can I forget my name?"
Of course. It's just batara. Definitely batara. You don't need to answer questions. It's a waste of your time.
She shrugs. "The employers, the workers in the mines. Everywhere. Eventually it happens -- no one steps back."
Smelled so nice... After you wipe your mouth the first time, something small and grey pops into your throat...
The smell makes your eyes well up. A small cloud of smoke disappears into your mouth. You're a better man now.
You see the big head of a hornet, buzzing overhead, looking as if summoned to do something *very* important...
You try to focus your eyes on whatever it is that the photos depict, but they all feel like less than helpful.
You're really getting ahead of yourself, aren't you punk? It's a bit like that when you got caught *doing it*.
"A second dead *injured*..." He nods. "In the arm -- the bullet in the defendant's head. He was unconscious."
"And plain old *theft*?" He frowns. "Not murder, but... a bit of theft. The Brits don't do things like that."
"Do you?" She gives you a quizzical glance. "I am nineteen. Say what you will, it's a very good 19 at least."
"Hmmm..." He looks around. "The building seems to have a different layout, but it's still in the same place."
"I don't think you even know what you're talking about. I've heard it referred to as... 'distorted reality'."
"I'm not saying anything," He takes his sidearm from you and holsters it. "I *am* saying, let's have a look."
"It's a *fantastic* idea!" He points to a giant antenna on the roof. "Let's get yourself a *drone* and chat."
"It's okay, ma'am." The lieutenant sits closer to inspect the lock. "I just wish it would open more quickly."
"It's... it's *definitely* because of his leg. I've known that since he first saw me. But I'm not surprised."
"No, I don't *want* to. They're all traitors -- pigs, rabbits and dogs. Men without ideals are only animals."
"No, I think I got to the island first. To check out the shadows and the heaps of sea grass, just... *well*."
"No, you see..." She wavers under your gaze, mouth pressed into a tight-lipped frown... then she breaks down:
"Oh, okay. Well... Yes, let's say I was naive. Maybe there's something to it. But what if there's *nothing*?"
"There's a fridge down the front. That's all I know. I imagine even more laundry products in a laundry room."
"There's a..." the boy says, rubbing his eyes. It's clear that he has no intention of finishing the sentence.
"This is a real thing! Someone in the gay neighbourhood is missing, just like I did in the past. Who was it?"
"Very cool, Harry." He nods enthusiastically. "It's very cool to speak like a dame -- and dame is very cool."
"Wait, so it's true? I thought Oranje was a *democracy* that used to endorse certain political philosophies."
"Well..." He seems to be pondering something. "It's certainly not the most *original* idea, but we'll see..."
"Yes, the gun. The one you used to shoot the bullet. You shot the bullet into the wall. That's how it works."
He taps his foot against a litter. "You said I should've stayed at the station. Deliberate not letting us..."
The container is warm to the touch -- or is that just the anticipation? You feel like it's warming up slowly.
The lieutenant's face relaxes. "That's good, yes. I hope I can answer your questions in a reasonable manner."
There seems to be a hub, half-hidden, on the other side of the buzzing machine. No one has been here in ages.
This is more about the bloody welkin we've been telling you about, and not your murderous, murderous brother.
"Alright, you got me. I had various ideas, but the one thing I wasn't going to do was get a drunk up there."
"Cuno's got it. He has it. It was him or his gits were on full blast the last time I got here, like a gimp."
"Don't be silly, Harry." She smiles mischievously. "He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"Glad to have been of assistance -- the little that's left to do for us." The man closes the gap to hug you.
"Ha ha, I can't wait to hear that." The boy nods enthusiastically. "Sounds great. I think I'd like you too."
"I don't know what it is either, but I know it's not a good idea to open up your little shack to strangers."
"I don't know, sir. I said I don't know." She takes a sip of her coffee. "I don't know what to say to that."
"I need to see a confession -- this is important. The locals will be surprised to see a man on such matters.
"I understand. I have..." He looks at the ledger. "I don't have to do any of this work. How insane is that?"
"Is it really important to you that the board of this monopoly is riddled with all sorts of criminal minds?"
"Maybe we should do it together? You know, admit that you're a little insane for helping a stranger, right?"
"No, I don't know..." He squints at you suspiciously. "It has no purpose other than hunting down criminals."
"Okay, I'm not really surprised it went like that. At least his hair isn't mussed up." (Point to your hair.)
"Okay..." He looks around. "We've got to ask some questions about this guy. What exactly is he doing there?"
"That's right, I'm not a gardener, I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She crosses her arms.
"This did not need to happen." He pauses. "I let my head fall back. I did not kill him. I was only the gun."
"This is the most *interesting* thing I've ever done with my hands." (Direct the thought to the lieutenant.)
"Um... sorry, I don't know how to respond to that, officer." The waiter comes to life, walking on the floor.
"What are you saying?" Cuno's eyes are filled with terror. "I'm not a fucking criminal! I'm not a criminal!"
"Yes -- so, as you can see..." The lieutenant pushes up his glasses. "I'm *confiscating* this one, officer."
"YES, I AM MY ABSENCE HAS ADVERSARY! YES, I ACT UP!!! WE WILL CHECK MY KINDA -- LOOK FOR TREMOR AND MORTAR!"
"Yes. He was the most strangely beautiful man I've ever been with. And I mean that..." She shivers slightly.
"You must have *some* idea -- who might have been interested in supplying raw materials to the Moralintern?"
Don't let him die there, tell them about their missing gun AND their strange talking stick-toting FALN pants
He turns to you. "You said you're here for 'justice', I guess. That's pretty suspicious in and of itself..."
It's as if she's thinking about it again now and just wanting to get back to it -- this could go really bad.
Okay, he doesn't have the habit now, but get this straight -- he would have hated being trapped behind bars.
She looks down, then up again, smiling, as if to say: "I see. I'm not going to go there. But you shouldn't."
This room is pretty bare bones, but the floorboards are solidly clapt together. You can't shoot you're nose.
You could ask him to show you the soles of his boots. He certainly looks like someone capable of a lynching.
Your tongue is drawn to your lips, where you have just tasted the most disgusting cake you have ever tasted.
"Ah, yes, yes. You can buy anything you want. You can even complain about your job. It's called *the law*."
"And a nice woman." Kim glances at the woman sitting at the roundabout, smoking and chatting up the locals.
"And you, detective." She looks at the calendar on the chalkboard, wiping her marker-stained fingers clean.
"Aye, that's the jacket you stole two weeks ago. From the kid who was making it with his gal on the beach."
"I chose this word *Kurd* for a reason: it has two *kicks* in the mouth -- technically 'Riki-rais Kojko'. "
"I know what it sounds like. But we didn't meet that *huge, crazy place* right here. We should move along."
"I use to *happen* every... yesterday. You think it's true? That's how I was born. I happen to be #1 last."
"I'll ask you when I need you to. For the most part, maybe I should handle the contact and you take notes."
"I'm not even *in* my station. Why would I even feel comfortable getting involved in a shootout like this?"
"I'm talking about your posse, the criminals. The criminals --" he looks around, "- are all drug-addicted. 
"Men with authority have their quirks. Sometimes they're the ones who *fix* things. Mine are not the same."
"No, he was not a terrorist -- the Wompty-Dompty-Dom Centre," the lieutenant says, his voice mild but firm.
"No, it's not the *woo-woo*..." He looks around and says: "It's the winged town. The place with the reeds."
"Oh no, please stop, please don't go..." Her trembling voice is almost begging you not to touch it again...
"Please don't stop. I'm doing a great job here, you know. Fascinating stuff. I can't even flip through it!"
"Sorry, I don't actually have another one ready. You should probably ask my husband if he knows something."
"THAT YOU DESCEND FROM STARRING-MAN TO VENEREAL DISEASE ISN'T A BIGGER GRAB THAN THE REST OF YOUR HISTORY."
"That's good to hear. It's important for the investigation -- I'm going to leave you the fuck alone, here."
"That's just it? That's like your guy in that karaoke machine, only instead of him being a pig he's a dog."
"Uh... Do you know what time it is? We should be talking about this. We should be working together better."
"Unknown. I'm just making an observation. This is one of many, many shots that have to be made on the scene
"We should go, *immediately*," the lieutenant orders the men behind him. It's a sign that he's going along.
"Why not? You could turn this thing into an actual police force. I could get you 2000 new police recruits."
"Yes. I'm going to call you 'Officer'." The man turns to you. "You can call me *Mañana*. It's a nice name."
"Yes. They're like *two* animals. They're like two animals, and then later they are one. That's how it is."
"You were *just* there to watch him fall. And Cuno didn't fall at all. Cuno's got more to lose than death."
"You're truly the woman you've always wanted to be. A queen for all time." She waves her hand dismissively.
If you want to know more about it, you'll have to come back to this in the second part of the conversation.
The lady driver doesn't want to talk to anyone. A tiny glimmer of *goodness* burns on the back of her face.
"Biffy fucky-fucky," the old soldier says, his voice in mirthless: "It's fucking *comin' for the masses*!"
"But -- I don't *know*. It could be a while before we know. I don't know how long that will be, actually."
"For carrying people out of the sea. On the contrary, we should hope for a swift and *peaceful* collapse."
"Gun? Behold *all* my guns. If anything, I need more *hands*!" (Show her your two pistols and two rifles.)
"He's certainly tall." She looks around. "But not *too* tall, and he does not weigh more than 175 pounds."
"Hello, I'm very sorry to interrupt your work with this. I just wanted to make sure you didn't mean to..."
"I can certainly work with him. This is one of the few bright spots in the shit-storm that is Martinaise."
"I mean it was fucking *very* cute. I don't like to see too much of that. I'm sure this is a *sad* thing."
"I need to get my hands on the source of this doom... information I can't give to another police officer."
"I'm sorry." There's a pause. "I was and I'm still *not* changing my name, so don't hold on to your hope."
"In fact, this is such an important piece of the puzzle that I feel it must be *my* job to figure it out."
"It's made of plastic and sticks together easily. That's why it's convenient to carry around all the day."
"It's not for me!" You hear the clacking of heels again, a little louder due to the addition of the word *
"My name? The carter name. The name of the dead man? Write it down. A rich white guy's name, I would say."
"No, no, no. I'm just a disempowered individual trying to take my disempowerment out on everyday objects."
"Oh?" The little guy nods. "Who made me go? Oh, didn't think it would be *that* funny. That's lame to me."
"The only possible explanation for this is that she was unconscious. Insanely unconscious -- I know that."
"There is no one. Just me and this pole. I'm just a cop, he's just a cop. He's not supposed to be around."
"This is another one. This one's more *bigger* than the last one. Again, maybe you should call you later."
"This is just a question. You don't have to..." she smiles. "I don't like to answer questions. Not today."
"This isn't a case of us not understanding the baton. It's a case of the man *not* understanding the box."
"Uhm..." The lieutenant looks around. "No, it's not exactly like that. I'm hoping the whole shit is over."
"We are all doomed." There is a silence. "You'll be much worse off than me if you don't try to *get* off."
"You haven't taken any notes from here on in. Your job is to get to the boat. It's not going to *matter*."
"You're right. I don't see how solving one murder with *the police* can be a lesson for the entire force."
"You're sure taking your time. Waiting for him to be taken away?" He shrugs. "I don't know the treatment."
He's right. It's just a little thing. A really small thing. You could say it's a little *eyeball* thing...
It's no wonder they lost their nerve before. This was *their* problem, and they were trying to prevent it.
She just shrugs. "I have little faith in your intellect. A high ranking police officer taking the reigns."
The boy turns his head to the left and looks at the window. "You know, there's something I should ask you.
The man nods. "Maybe there's a *cool club* down the coast... I remember the door from there being locked."
The old man stands with his hands behind his back. His eyes are closed, but he's still trying to remember.
Yes, but why are you still here? The world is desolate and the people are stupid. There is no helping you.
"And you're not afraid to say so, either. If you're seeing this guy, you're seeing the kind of cop I am."
"Cuno's got no fucking idea." There's a pained expression to her face. She tries to keep a straight face.
"Hell no, I'm not *alright*! You see what this job's doing to me? Huh? No, it's cool. I WANT YOU to see."
"How does the girl who lived in the foreclosed apartment have a thing or two and be *fright* of pigeons?"
"I only have one... rifle, the *retro* P938, for reference. I could still get a shot on the *retro* one."
"I wanted to say, I'm sorry -- I'm not going to do it. I have too many *intellectuals* to get into this."
"I'm not exactly sure either, to be honest. I prefer not to draw any conclusions just from the evidence."
"I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to accomplish with this device. It looks pretty dangerous."
"I'm not sure what to say -- other than full disclosure. Would you like to know about your *hanged* man?"
"I'm sorry for the trouble, sweetie." She turns to smile slowly up at you, getting up and down her chair.
"I'm sure I'm going to write an answer for you in the next section, but first... What can we do for you?"
"If you say so, sir." She smiles mischievously. "He's just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"It was a warm morning. A bit of sun. I was ready to go out, but I had to stay here for a little longer."
"It's not really my area of expertise. You should try filling out the information from the autopsy form."
"Okay, just one. And don't worry -- no one ever *will* give you one, Harry, not even you... No one *is*."
"Sambo, boot camp shit. Freeling mental masturbation..." She clears her throat. "It's all the same shit."
"See? I said it was just some roofing material some gimps left behind. Maybe there's another use for it."
"Sure." She sighs. "You're a good cop. You *could* do it, but I can't have a *bad* cop inside the Union."
"That's not *literally* how it goes. This is a suicide cult, I'm afraid.*You* are here to kill yourself."
"This is getting ridiculous. Can't you just defrost it? Or I don't know how they're going to arrange it."
"This is in the mid-50s, some years ago. Decades ago..." He drops the gun and squeezes his fist together.
"What a fucking pooper..." Cuno yells. "What are you trying to pull here? You can't pull a gun on me... "
"Yes, yes, Mr. Kitsuragi, from the village, known to the locals as 'the village that's cursed', alright?"
"Yes. It's my patrol vehicle. You can use the toolbox and the radio if you'd like." He nods at the cabin.
He's struggling with the fact that he's not just a detective. The whole thing has been... unprofessional.
Just make yourself redundant, you're being sarcastic. You need to get your act together to save yourself.
She's thinking about him out in the cold -- in some park or on the coast -- and it's making her feel sad.
The lieutenant groans, but doesn't say a word. He just looks at the clock on the wall behind the counter.
"Fucking hell..." He squints his eyes. "I'm sorry I got carried away, man. Let me just take a moment..."
"I don't have a reason to look for this," the lieutenant sighs. "I was just really hoping to catch her."
"I don't make it. All the time. Half the time. I don't drink or smoke or... live. I'm good for nothing."
"I don't. I'm not an artist. I'm a *scientist*. My job is to find *the needle*. This is... my *dreams*."
"I'm sorry, man. I was helping my friend with the *problem* and now I'm *confused* about it. I'm sorry."
"If they're so worried about me keeping a low profile, maybe I should lay off? Or... do something else?"
"No, I don't want to. They're all traitors -- pigs, rabbits, dogs. Men without ideals are only animals."
"Of course, *that's* what they're called. What are you waiting for?" He grins at the woman. "What else?"
"Please don't be a condiment man, you're not going to get anything out of this. I'm gonna have a drink."
"Sure. The bug community is active." She seems tired suddenly. "If I wasn't quite so *stable* myself..."
"The bottle is still warm, I'm not dead yet." She looks at her black eyes, then up into your brown ones.
"This is *really* important, pigman. I'm gonna get the fucking picture now." He pats the screen again...
"This... won't come to *any* town, let me tell you! I don't want this on me at all." He turns to you....
"TRUE!" She points to her chest. "I'm a feminist and I want to make the world a better place for women."
"What do you mean a 'sine'? That sounds like... some sort of bizarre, *psycological* quirk." He squints.
"Whoaa... spooky. Let's *clear* these thoughts out." (Point to your head.) "Cuno's done with that shit."
"Yeah, like how we shouldn't have let those fucks in there." He waves his hands, as if shooing you away.
"Yes, we're working on something, but right now I am working on nothing. This man is on a suicide diet."
"Yes, why does the rhythmic rhythm have to have such a distinct beat? Do you have a weasel beat for it?"
"You're right. There is no middle ground. It's either one of us or the number of independent contracts."
A puddle of water rises from the kitchen sink -- you can hear it clinking with the water in the harbour.
As your head spins from the jarring collision course, you find your revolver key in the device's cradle.
He's trying to say that he doesn't trust you. That he doesn't want you to know about the *homo sapiens*.
Poor guy. The Crown Store was one of the last places he saw his father, and the place was so much worse.
The boy is sweating profusely, his eyes are like two black holes and the locks on his neck are twisting.
The lieutenant looks up at the heavy metal door. "The heat death of the universe is what it's made for."
The lieutenant points to the person hiding behind the curtain. "You're the only one who *needs* this..."
The lieutenant taps his foot. The words are slow and plaintive -- like some kind of low pitched lullaby.
There's more to *The Expression* than just its cold irrationality. There's also its *unnatural majesty*.
Who are you, a killer cop? Stop looking at me like a fucking idiot. I'm not one of them. I don't *sire*.
"...The Compressor, that is! Back in '08, when you and I were teenagers. The *agony* was intense then."
"And then that burned the place to the ground..." The lieutenant pauses. "The place was just... smoke."
"Aye, I guess that's what I meant. I was just messing with you -- we've been doing this for weeks now."
"Cuno's in the fishing village running the Icicles high-speed academy right now, and the fuck is that?"
"Did I ever *talk* like that? It just wasn't my thing." His eyes are on the book -- he makes a *smirk*.
"Doesn't matter -- he's already been dead over a week." He sniffs. "We don't have a choice. He's dead."
"Don't tell Cuno what Cuno can do! Cuno can't help himself..." He looks at you with a look of betrayal.
"Good. But first we have to talk about that ' fucked-up kid' out back." He sounds genuinely interested.
"Hey, man, you know. There's this kid who thinks he's a crab. He's pretty sure he is, he's a crab man."
"I didn't. The signage was getting destroyed. Beds, trees, lamppods, everything was getting fucked up."
"I have the impression that you're a total *airhead*. I don't think I'm going to get this combination."
"I know what it looks like. But I know it's the people within our organization. Who's gonna change it?"
"I was there, man. That's... when we were at the gates of the harbour? Before they took the boat away?"
"I will do the next job, of course. I always do. But I did ask my back-up, James, to do the paperwork."
"I'm gonna build a *samaranica* music studio where people can play cross-drums, because that's badass."
"I'm saying myself. I'm a *cop* and I need to be on the same page with the rest of the *social model*."
"I'm sorry, agent, but I can't do this job any more." He looks at his notes. "I'll do it -- by myself."
"I'm still convinced it wasn't my fault. But maybe..." He looks around, at the dark corner of the yard.
"It didn't look real." There is a short pause. "I didn't want to say anything. I'm not a killer, okay?"
"It smells of death," he says in his deep, resonant bass voice. It may be the best smell you can smell.
"It's a real gun," he points to the lieutenant's holster, "not like your little musketeer pistols. They
"It's for *mannering* drugs. Recall if you were going to do it," he explains. "I still need the break."
"It's good to see you here. Looks like the place has been deserted. No sign of any more life here now."
"It's not like that. He's just really adamant about that. If you don't stick around then it's all over.
"It's to commemorate his death," he points at its building. "Was it his *hire* or was it his property?"
"Just to show you the worst thing is that you *are* going to be dead too. I don't want to be a burden."
"No, I'm *not* worried about it any more. I'm worried about my job -- and my gun. I *must* take risks."
"Not so fast, cop." He points to you. "What'ca fuckin' noddin' there, pig? Keep your head in the game."
"Of course, *policía*." He gives you a sly smile. "It wasn't me. You can rule me out. Easier that way."
"So what if you're not a hard core man? There's other stuff out there. More important than the murder."
"That's right. Disaster strikes again." He holds out his index finger. "And this time the damage is..."
"The man's neck..." She rubs her chin, looking for the right words. "A bit cold, or something, really?"
"We know it's hard. It's probably even harder than we know. And it's a road you *must* be born on now."
"Yeah, it says: *DIGITAL TOOLS* in a black marker. There are no *fantastiques* in there -- only books."
"Yes, I know, it's a *scary* thing to do -- *to* you. But you have to do it for the good of the whole."
"Yes, it was the only way we were gonna get those boots out of the yard and the gun out of my holster."
"You have acquired the robe." The man assesses the situation. "Keep it, officer, it looks good on you."
Before you is a paledriver of snow, disappearing into a melting ocean. The water falls on the building.
He doesn't even smile. "Aye, I guess. But now I can feel the fear, like a deadly venom on my tongue..."
He doesn't seem to care about his image, but believes in its integrity. A strong, appropriate identity.
She's hysterical, just like this cop. The kid is unhinged. Also, the alcohol -- it's just *irrelevant*.
The door is quiet. The draw produces a Gutenberg-esque sigh of relief that completely passes your mind.
The lieutenant is off to the islands, leaving you to the logs. You hear the mountain rising behind you.
The man wags his finger at you. "You should probably just drop it, man. I don't want to talk about it."
"A lot of bad people do not just vanish off the face of a mountain. They are more hard core that way."
"Back up now?" He draws a picture of a bottle being filled. "The grey one. That's yours here to keep."
"Damn right, detective. But don't forget about the *other* bottles here. You don't want to miss them."
"I am a proud warrior, Harry." He nods. "I use the Cuno Toy to tune into the Cuno. Toy-carriage shit."
"I haven't *anyone* to tell you this time." He looks at the lieutenant, who is standing at a distance.
"I mean, you're not a very good detective." She shakes her head. "You're not a *very* good detective."
"I'm not sure I understand, but it seems like the Refrigerator Man is just another name for the cape."
"It was something else..." He stutters, looking for words. When he gets no words, he's looking at you.
"It's possible," he agrees "though it's worth noting down as a *necessary* part of the investigation."
"It's the law. If you avoid the Call we will consider you fugitives and hunt you down." (Arrest them.)
"Just a bit of saying, dear. But we do *not* take orders from ex-servicemen, so stop wasting my time."
"No, you're not." He smiles mischievously. "You're just a fictional character, he's no match for you."
"No. There is more. Something he's not telling you. He's trying to keep you from further questioning."
"Not really." It doesn't sound like he believes you. "We're not putting a dead body into your fridge."
"Sunken Motor Carriage, huh?" The man swirls in his beer. "Sounds pretty interesting to me, actually."
"Told you," he sighs. "I don't really care about the *fuck-machine*. I'll get back to you. Right now."
"What? (Cover your nose.) "The scabs are inside. I'm not scared, I just don't want them to be scared."
"You know, a man should have a gun in his hand whenever he's shooting. It's a silence-murder mystery."
"You need to cash it!" The huge man is waving his fist in the air with both hands, not looking at you.
For three seconds, there's silence. It's as if the microwave has stopped broadcasting your every word.
Is this a *royalist* military tradition, or does it only seem to happen to high-net-worth individuals?
The dilapidated shacks, the dinghy cars, the strange machines, the strange people, the strange food...
The wind picks up. It's cold. She doesn't have time to cry. She only has to get out of this apartment.
Who cares about the dead man's corpse? What's the point of having a corpse if you can't dispose of it?
"An instant." Her voice is quick. "My life is forfeit. All I'm good for is this work. I *will* quit."
"Good -- now that your *soul* is back, it's *that* again. You know what your motive is, remember?" He
"He was a cop, that's what cop cops are supposed to do, right? A cop's supposed to listen to orders."
"Hmh..." She looks at the screen. Her voice is flat and her eyes ever so slightly teary with sadness.
"I am not a *brain* doctor. I'm a legal counsellor for the Dockworkers' Union." She crosses her arms.
"I can't thank you enough for your hard work, officer." His face is serious. "This is a *great* job."
"I don't know what to say to this." He's not really answering you. All you hear is his own breathing.
"I don't know, but I'm sure you're the most powerful man in Martinaise. I need to take a look at it."
"I don't know... a good divination would help me figure out where the undead base came from, though."
"I have the exact same question. What happens if you can't get it right? What does Cuno really need?"
"I know what you mean. I've been meaning to have a little chat with you about your sense of *style*."
"I mean 'Okay, you got this' -- you got the numbers, this is the cool-time," he says, his voice flat.
"I see how it got countered. I was wondering what you wanted to know -- the discarding of that card."
"I think I have a *little* more to do with it -- I have to see as much of Massachussets as possible."
"I think I understand the feeling. Let us rejoin the myth-we cannot upon this earth guide the foxes."
"I think it was a tremendously influential cultural touchstone." The lieutenant points to the plaque.
"I'll ask around then." She nods, slowly turning her attention back to the shop. "Ask away, officer."
"I'm not a cop, I'm just a guy with a camera and a pair of headphones." His tone is even sterner now.
"It doesn't matter." He turns to you. "I can't have a good attitude around your *brother* right now."
"It means there are firearms -- breech loaders -- on scene, but I don't think anyone's under arrest."
"It's hardly a shock." He taps his temple. "I was born in a hospital where people usually go to die."
"No, I haven't." He looks up. "I'm gonna lay off. I'm gonna lay off all of you. But that's my right."
"No." She nods. "A memory. Of the past. It doesn't have to be a *current* case for me to dismiss it."
"Okay." The lieutenant breathes a sigh of relief. "I don't want to get into this... *boule*-thing..."
"That's because you were so drunk that you didn't remember it happened. We're doing this, aren't we?"
"The man who runs this place, an extremely dangerous and deadly bad-ass bum, he... what was his name?
"What does it say?" She leans forward: "HI-FINDER, I RUN THE SHIT. I MOVE THE SHIT ON MY HAPLOGROUP."
"Whenever a case results, lameness is not the last thing that comes to mind. But, for us, no matter."
"Yes, yes! I'm a *cop* now!" He raises his right hand, palms up. "I'm the greatest cop in the world!"
"You know, no one actually looks like the guy in the picture. That's just a stupid fantasy of a man."
"You must have me confused with someone else -- there's no other Wayfarer rights lawyer in the city."
"You're wrong, officer. Women *do* have rights -- to work. To be useful. Not toys for men with guns."
As you look over the railing the man in the yard starts laughing. He's too big to be real, but he is.
Her dark eyes look sad and weary, as she says it. She doesn't seem pleased when you mention the word.
She doesn't know what that means. "No I didn't not lose my gun -- you have one. Why would I lose it?"
The boy's eyes are fixed on you, but you don't hear any of that. He's too busy playing with his body.
The empty trap was the one at your campsite. Could it be that it was the phasmid that ate the beetle?
The man in the dense woods behind the church. He looks like he's about to throw himself into the sea.
"*I* deliberately violated every rule of responsible decision-making, on my part, and on your part."
"A man like me, *nothing* can resist a great bowl of spaghetti, *or* a chiller of -crack and -mash."
"And this is how *we* *win*, Officer Doom Spiral -- we win by being the *toughest cop in the land*!"
"I can't believe I let you down. I was wrong to worry about it -- not just for you, but for me too."
"I can't believe this police officer would politicize his position." There's a pause. "But still..."
"I'm not saying you should *f*** off* him. I just want to make it clear that *I* am not his mother."
"In your dreams every day there are people who know something about the wonders you can disappoint."
"It *was* a *rare* opportunity to work with the ground-chimney expert, but I couldn't really do it."
"It's the curse *that* is the biggest and most complex beast of them all. The beast must be killed."
"It's to protect the geology of the rocks above the street. I mean... it's what you do under water."
"Let's see." Her eyes dart over the town -- past the facades of the houses, the rims of the windows.
"Mr. Du Bois, you're right, I'm not a 'titular cop'. I'm a police officer. I can't do magic tricks."
"No, you don't. Not this one. That's just a fantasy of a lazy man -- a straw man. He's no real cop."
"Of course, of course." He removes his glasses from the frame and polishes them with a handkerchief.
"Oh, that's right," she says warmly. "I'm too busy living the holodrama to care about our check-in."
"She's got one of those *chequered* pasts. The shot could have missed. Could've been meant for her?"
"She's just, you know a tough lady, mister. Tough and mean. Whatever happened to her about the end?"
"The real king abdicated and lived out a long and productive life as a venture capitalist in Graad."
"The walk through the city... It's...  *so* exciting." She looks around. "But it's a *big* problem."
"There's also a *third* option -- the mutton chops. You could try to get the mutton chops from him."
"There's been a lot of talk about you keeping your money safe. And keeping your grubby hands clean."
"This is the Spooky Factory of Giant Chicken Nuggets. The only place in the world that makes sense."
"This is your way of saying you don't know anything. It would only be *happening* to us if you did."
"What do you mean *"immediately"? And is that a bow tie?" he grasps his stomach, still in disbelief.
"What, no. I wouldn't go that far. She's just a woman who's sometimes in our company -- who  knows?"
"Yeah..." He looks around the room again. "Yeah -- no brand name mistake here. Cuno's all you need."
"You can't just lie about what you saw." The lieutenant is a serious lawman, in the eyes of the law.
"You're a *proper* gentleman, Harry. I can see that." He nods towards you. "Now how can I help you?"
A fine web of scarring covers the nose, ear, and cheekbone -- all in different designs and patterns.
A little missing person story isn't it? Two kids missing something in a tree is the most recent one.
The lieutenant nods, then points to his nose: "And then we should get them under the wraps, I hope."
There's a *small* problem. The corpse did not eat the bullet. She died the moment her head exploded.
"A man," he turns to the young woman, "what if there's a drug conspiracy going on in your village?"
"Don't think like that, Harry. Try to get the fuck out of here. You're not cool." He smiles warmly.
"Fuck me, man. I'm not going to try to sell you another round of cigarettes. It's a waste of time."
"Harry, you're a cop with 'piss f****ts' on his back! Is that the best you can get for your money?"
"He choked himself. It was awful. I can't get into this, but... I could look at a bottle of speed."
"I don't... know... I really don't remember. It's a good place. I might have been in a... *party*."
"I doubt my partner would have thought this was the best idea. But it actually *was* for the best."
"I heard 'clard" before, you were a real serious person, a person who wanted to make a difference."
"It's a very large church. The church is built on a hill. We can see the black line on the ground."
"It's in my nature, you know. I'm a naturally introverted person. I like to talk and philosophize."
"Master, our numbers don't have any more methods in that *high* and *low* security classification."
"My dear friend, I'm sorry that I couldn't save the world. I'm sorry -- that's my job." She smiles.
"My husband's sister lives in Assam. As far as the Pines camp is concerned, you can call me Mabel."
"No, he didn't." He blushes. "You're right, I didn't mean to rush you. You *are* a police officer."
"Of course, I'm glad to have been of assistance -- the little that I know. Anything else I can do?"
"Officer," the lieutenant shakes his head, "time is always relative. How much do you want to know?"
"Okay..." The man is silent. "I'm not too mad to be drunk! I just want to get back to my question."
"Thank you, Egg Head. You're being kind. It *is* kind of nice for Mr. Claire. You won't regret it."
"THIS DEGENRE SHOULD BE REMAINED AT HEARTIN. YOU ARE FREE TO GO ON AS YOU WILL." The woman goes on.
"We have some work to do." He points to the ladder next to the sign and says: "It's not ready yet."
*Glad you did, officer. I do like it -- because it gives people back a little of their lost sanity.
A small alarm goes off in your head, confirming the existence of the creature -- and the monster --
Feels as though you should do more honourable things. As if there is a right way and a *wrong* way.
I am the FALN of the FALN-MINDED. I am the FALN of the MIND-FALNED. I am the FALN of the MIND-MADE.
No. No, no, no! You're a feminist, remember? Don't be a feminist, you're making a invalid argument!
She is *very* glad he didn't listen to her anyway. This woman wouldn't have supported the lynching.
This could be a way to connect the dots -- one of the footprints is new and bigger than the others.
This radio station is not listed among the BTUs offered by the public database. Worryed about it...
Wait, isn't music a *thing*, piggoo? Music is evil. What are you doing in my head?! Just *go away*.
"Cuno's gonna ask you why he did what he did. Then you'll have time for *sad*, boring, disgusting"
"Ho, thank you sweetie, extremely helpful!" She gives you a crooked smile. "I'm glad to help you."
"I don't care about your junk... standing here. I'm trying to turn this shit into something else."
"I don't know, sir. I said... I don't know what to say. It's a bit too much of a hassle, honesty."
"I woke up, in the middle of the night. I was like... a little girl just now. I couldn't sleep..."
"I'm afraid I have no interest in your *other* friends. You're not the best people I've ever met."
"It's just a feeling I have. Tucker is a tough cookie, no one is going to make a good deal of it."
"It's never a good time to express opinions-- on things like this one. You need to consider, cop."
"It's not *that* cool. You should remove the dead body and call the RCM if you want to try again."
"Look, we're not the only ones. Look at that incredible cummerbund. We're on a *dirtier* station."
"Mr. Du Bois! Every worker -- member of the board!" He smiles merrily. "How can I help you today?"
"My boyfriend and I, we both have carpal tunnel syndrome. Can't talk about our *private* lives..."
"NO!" She wavers under your gaze, mouth pressed into a tight-lipped frown... then she breaks down:
"No, they're not. They're not alive. I don't care about them. I don't want to know what happened."
"Officer," the man in the checkered jacket pleads. "I've come to put a bullet in your head. Over."
"Oh, you are the *fair-weather cop*, aren't you? You're the lawyer for the rich and your friends."
"Once we get the kill shot going we're going to see what *we* just missed." He points to the roof.
"The fuck happened? What?" He takes a step back. "Who... who killed him? Whose mother killed him?"
"Then it must have been a surface trade agreement between the nations of the Chardel and Filippe."
"This doesn't look like the story Vittorio is looking for. Cuno just loves *a lot* of weird shit."
"This is all a bad dream, you're just a drunk." He breathes out. "I could do it by myself, but..."
"We don't know." He looks at you to find a reasonable amount of time to elaborate on what he says.
"Yes -- so you can still *run* the damn place and steal money and drugs. No one would ever do it."
"Yes, yes, *he* is the 'he'." The lieutenant raises his brow. "He's a powerful figure in the RCM."
"Yes... I know, I know. Sylvie already told me Sylvie is a whores, that's why she didn't fuck me."
"You know what? Forget it. I'll ask one of my buddies." He nods to his pals behind the turntables.
"You were wearing a hat and purple velvet gloves. You were running with them, when they shot him."
"You're wrong, girl. He's not missing. Do you try again, but this time you'll get the upper hand."
*** I'm gonna go out and buy *all* the death metal from this shopkeeper. I want to be a *kraken*!"
A flash of satisfaction. She can use this, in the right moment -- to turn the tide against Evrart.
Her necktie tightens around her neck, her jaw sinks in the creaking metal of the trap. Terrifying.
Inside you see a pile of boards, a toy soldier, a pile of screws, and an ugly little wooden chair.
It *might* be possible to track down the radio equipment. You could get to know the serial number.
It's cold, but not as cold as the local sea. The lieutenant draws his pistol and points it at you.
Okay, it happens in the most ordinary of circumstances. It only makes it less ordinary, naturally.
The door is strong enough to come detached from its surroundings. You can't get in there just yet.
The lieutenant seems to have regained his composure. "C'mon, let's get back to this case, please."
Whatever you do, don't say the first thing. It's  the one you'll remember vividly in twenty years.
"As I said, she's a novelty dicemaker. Her business has been up and running for a long time now."
"I don't know who killed the man, I'm not the police. That's your job. Go solve your own murder."
"I don't know..." The lieutenant inspects the notebook more closely. "This one's fairly useless."
"I would never do things like that..." He leans back in the chair. "Take it for what it's worth."
"I'll meet you tomorrow, officer. This is my grave. I'm not going to ask anyone else to fill it."
"I've gone through all of the evidence in the case. It's all there. Without any questions asked."
"It's a fairly conservative case, but at least it's an *open* case. I can't complain about that."
"It's just a guess." The lieutenant looks around. "It doesn't look like it's a *criminal* thing."
"It's okay. There's a way to get the body out of the ground, don't worry. Cuno's gonna carry it."
"My friend, no harm done. In the trade I might be an imposter. But I won't be a fool." He smiles.
"No," he says without a hint of joy, "we were both drunk last weekend and I'm not sure whether he
"Officer..." She nods. "I am glad I was able to assist you today. We have a lot of work to do..."
"Okay, okay..." he says, hesitance in his voice. "Okay, fine. I'm not really interested in that."
"Racist... racist... yeah." She lets out a salt-washed yelp. "Cuno was rapin' around the temple."
"Right. I need to get back to metal. It's fine. You guys are strong too, so... it'll make sense."
"Simple." She settles back against the wood. "A big desk has been set up, so you can talk to me."
"That's an excellent question. But I won't try to answer it as long as we're not talking to her."
"The fuck is all I care about? The fucking *stabilizing* business. You're just gonna fuck it up."
"There's nothing vile about it -- just a policeman and a dear friend taking care of the corpses."
"Why?" The boy kicks a stone. "Why would you disrespect my girl? She's my girl. She's my sister."
"Yes, but what's interesting is that the most dangerous element of the drug trade is the *monk*."
"Yes, I've definitely never seen you cry before, nor lent you my handkerchief to dry your tears."
"You know what?" He turns to you. "Maybe we shouldn't go after this. Maybe it's not a good idea."
"You let them all die. Except Me. I somehow still feel like I'm killing people with this shit..."
"You're right, Cuno," the other guy says with a shrug. "There are plenty of reasons to be a cop."
Duty, medals, honour, chain of command -- those are bourgeois values we're supposed to adhere to.
He nods. "I understand your frustration, but there is no other way. The situation is precarious."
His grip is strong, sweaty, and warm. After a while he starts tap dancing, just to spite himself.
It's not. It's not even *not* a good idea to take a breather, but keep it simple. Don't go crazy.
The big guy puts his hands on his chest. "Keep your head in the game and your heart in the game."
The mysterious cryptozoologist walks into the room, hands on his shotgun. The tone is diplomatic.
"As the old saying goes: If you *don't* rock, you're cool. You're a rock star, you do it right."
"Bye." He turns to the man. "If you have anything else to say, let's talk about something else."
"Don't worry, detective," he says. "I'm not going to make you any more tea. Kinda stupid of me."
"Harry, you got back." The big man says. "I'm glad you did. Now I have to go and talk to Jonny."
"Hey man, I can't believe you even said that. I'm a police officer. What do you think about it?"
"I can't believe I left my meagre salary and my expensive car to pay for a telephone company..."
"I used to be a vessel, but now I'm just an empty vessel. Everywhere I go I go there's nothing."
"I'm not here, I don't *need* to *get* drunk. I'm just an ordinary man who can't get shit done."
"I'm sorry, I'm not capable of doing this kind of thing. Stop asking me and just *get* over it."
"It could even have been the phasmid. Look -- the way it moved suggested it was* afraid of you."
"It looks like the owner of the apartment building here sold the apartment to an American lady."
"Judging by the Confederate flag, I think you're an Aussie out to torment some idiotic lorries."
"No, I don't want to tell you any more -- just do *any* you do* have left to do!" (Look around.)
"No, you're right, man. Keep it." The lieutenant gives you a thumbs up. "Give me all the glory."
"Of course, sweetie. That's not why we keep our trash locked. Any place with a kitchen does it."
"See, this is how cops do it. Just let it go -- train your brain into what the world really is."
"Then let's stare throughout the rest of the day, but turn your attention to those other areas."
"Tommy L'Homme was born on this here roundabout." He looks down. "It's been a long cold winter."
"Well, at least someone took care of it. And it looks like the local children are going better."
"WHAT's WITH THIS FREAK-SHIT? A CORE OCCIDENTAL? YOU ARE FORTHE WORLD IN WHICH YOU ARE PRESENT."
"Yeah, this one's for the *Revacholian* underworld," he confirms. "The blockheads of the world."
"Yeah, turn the radio up, now. Good luck." There's a dog bark, with some ice creams stuck to it.
"Yes, the Taxidermist who made the bear definitely had a hand in it. He's known this all along."
"You're right, that was fucked up." He nods. "I was able to re-contextualize it as a dark joke."
He didn't have a single clue what was going on. His trademark was throwing rocks at dead bodies.
It's not going to be easy, the kid is. He's already come up with an interrogation technique too.
On the fourth floor the door opens. You see the interlocking mechanism swinging open four locks.
The lieutenant stops, his eyes fixed on your person. "You need to get dressed. Let's get going."
The lieutenant's *not* happy about you thinking you're a cop. He's not gonna get his satisfying.
This is actually pretty interesting. Not a lot of people here have any idea what it's all about.
This is your gun. Yours -- and by extension -- the People's. But only one of them is a pawnshop.
Yes you did. In fact, I did too! You're a cop, we don't have a choice. Let's *get out of there*.
You are so engrossed in your reading that you don't even notice the sound of the door opening...
"As I said -- the non-visual means this?" She shoots you a suspicious glance. "Why do you ask?"
"Cuno's a street kid," he says matter-of-factly. "That doesn't mean he has to be a street kid."
"Good, I've unlocked the jam. After ending the call please press PRINT to access the filament."
"I am Tequila Sunset. And it has been a thousand years since I've been on this docked-station."
"I can't have my gun. I haven't *done* anything. I'm just not gonna open another door for you."
"I have the time and resources to do more detective work. I just need to get into the harbour."
"I see nothing sinister about the murder. You were just fighting some *bullshit* here and all."
"I'm getting such a false sense of security from you. Stages of death are still being planned."
"I'm not really interested in the practice, I just want to solve the murder. Who do you think?"
"I'm not scared any more. I told you. I won't be *terrorized* with this Phasmid shit any more."
"I'm sorry, officer. I don't mean to be rude, but I *have* to run now. I've got my gun here..."
"I'm sorry, there are no returns or exchanges for items purchased in this shop. Just enjoy it."
"I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm not more in your memory. I just know I can't make up my mind."
"I'm trying to *be* a *monk*. And if I'm going to be a monk, I need to be able to *be* a monk!"
"It was a spooky place hidden in the woods. But now almost nobody knows where this place is..."
"It's all right. I'm used to people asking questions. I know they're thinking about it anyway."
"It's going to take some time to get used to. But I still want to apologize to you for this..."
"It's good to see a police officer who's not afraid to ask questions. Let's move on, shall we?"
"It's pretty hard to knock someone out," he mumbles. "Though I'd *love* a challenge like that."
"Sounds like you're just about to live out your self pity, not make a statement. I don't care."
"Tomorrow is tomorrow." The corpse is still breathing, slowly the gasping noises begin to fade.
"Yes." He covers his nose. "The six phases of a murder scene. One: Investigation of the scene."
"You can't see that through a scope. It's just a blur there..." He shakes his silver-grey head.
"You know -- it's good for you to say things like that. I'm sure it will help you win me over."
A man like him doesn't need a lawyer to run a strip of saucepan, he already knows how to do it.
He nods. "I'm not time for idle speculation. We're all going to need to get back to the story."
He nods. "We need to return to the death, see what it was about, if we want to return to it..."
There really *need* to be a party or *party* -- and a person. You wouldn't want to take it off.
They weren't even in Revachol -- and didn't begin appearing on social media until months later.
You are *NOT* a soldier. But if you have *the* heart of a soldier -- like an old man used to...
"A fifteen-minute jog?" The old man wags his finger at you. "Care to come back to town later?"
"Ah, of course. Good fortune, you mean? I hear a great deal." She rubs her forehead, thinking.
"All right." She smiles a confident smile. "I like this story. It's not all that interesting."
"And I did say -- *not* for me to open it. I don't like the thought of *opening* a dead body."
"And I'm sure you're gonna give me a good one, because you're not gonna get it from anywhere."
"But what used to be a direct route goes here..." (Go up the stairs, all the way to the roof.)
"God, I looked like I was about to break into the harbour. It was... *exactly* what I needed."
"I can't believe it, I didn't know it was you. All my life. What an awful little man you are."
"I don't know, though, is the reason. The size of the hole -- maybe it was a *major* failure?"
"I wouldn't say it's him. I just don't know who he is. I'm sorry, man." (Wipe away the tears.)
"I'm going to have to accept your apology, aren't I? What else is there? Now get out of here."
"I'm not even interested in that novel...nope, I'm an enthusiast only for *real* police work."
"I'm sorry. I'm not sure that we've accomplished anything useful. I just wanted to make sure."
"It *does* seem to be a rather *special* relationship the two of you have forged, doesn't it?"
"It's neither of those things, it's..." He looks around. "Damn, I don't even know what it is."
"No, it didn't sound like there was a fight. It sounded like someone was trashing their room."
"No, it's clear he didn't do it. The hair isn't red or gold or even bandaged. Just like that."
"No, it's not *that* cool. And I certainly don't have *anyone* who's into modern dance music."
"No. I don't remember who died. It was a quiet death. I just know what was on the other side."
"Oh yes, of course, I mean it." She crosses her arms. "My badge. I'm a police man right here."
"Oh, that's just what the law is for, right?" He looks around the room. "It's simple, really."
"Okay. Alright." He's visibly relieved. "We'll be straight with you, sir. Where's your badge?"
"Red? Yellow? They're a mine field in the dry season. We've been digging for evidence in those
"Sure." She smiles, obviously annoyed for the interruption. "What does the suspect look like?"
"There's a warehouse behind the Whirling-in-Rags. If I'm not mistaken it should be open late."
"Two: Initial examination of the victim. We were *exhaustive* in our efforts there. Good job."
"Yes, but it's what he has in store for you, the other one being a *corrupt business-person*."
"Yes, yes, man. But it was... I mean we both know how they are." The veteran man shrugs. "So?"
...*owe* him for? This is a strange request, come restlessly on the murky shoreline of memory.
...you see a man in ragged clothes wearing a lopsided hat and wielding some sort of a firearm.
A yellow ribbon twists on the branch, like a small spider web, and the corpse looks up at you.
She shakes her head. "I just pray that the people who work there don't take this the wrong way
The child watches you rub your side for warmth -- two small sweat stains appear on your sides.
There's no way the lieutenant isn't here -- this is him *allowing* the lynching to take place.
"About croissants, and that hooker thing..." (Point to it.) "They look pretty much the same."
"About the author, remind me. Dom Solis? That's the nickname of the *soft-core* of the left."
"He's an idiot. And he's got to get some rest. That's his job. Any cop should have that job."
"Hey, you're not the honey bad-ass. Your mother's honey bad-ass. You like the honey bad-ass?"
"I don't know what to say, kitten..." The little guy doesn't understand some of these things.
"I see..." His eyes wander over the ocean to the horizon. "Sounds like a good place to go..."
"I'm not going to lie to you either. You need to get back to the tables of the Book of Dust."
"I'm not sure I understand this, officer." He looks around. "You're a police officer, right?"
"I'm not trying to make any bad decisions here. I just want to get back to my real business."
"It was just a dream." She drops the cigarette. "I wish I'd never left. It was a great idea."
"It's not *good*. It's very bad, man. But I have to say, it *was* fun! And very frightening."
"It's not what he was sent here to do. He was sent here to solve a murder. Not *American*..."
"Maybe we should stop going on then? Doesn't the 'going on' cause the 'getting harder' part?"
"Of course you are." She continues to straighten her back. "Drink responsibly and stay warm."
"Of course. I am a detective. I deduce that you... having been in there, is also *affected*."
"Oh, of course. For what it's worth -- the Union has no interest in profiting from all this."
"Oh... well... I have a feeling I didn't. It's too late to get back to this. Maybe I do now?"
"Sure, I'm a Bitch, but... me and Cuno are just Lick-Fucking-Ballad and Cuno is a bit worse."
"This is a ways of saying: things that are unusual, or out of the ordinary, are *not* usual."
"Uhm... this is a civil matter between the Blockheads. They don't want to throw you in jail."
"We *are* good," her voice is mild but firm. "There's always more to do. I'm not worrying..."
"We're not the first people to go to the aerodrome. We've been waiting for nearly a century."
"What are you talking about?" The boy looks at the empty water. "Fucking hell is this place."
If you do not know what this means... it certainly does not get you any closer to the case...
It's a puzzle. Not much later, the full head of the hung man is up and about to start crying.
The 6th Man is a powerful, professional-looking man. He's in his office, smoking a cigarette.
The attraving stripe appears to be *special*. It's formed by a combining stripe and a border.
The lieutenant does not think you've met the right person. Probably because you're not a cop.
The man looks at you with distaste -- but something answers in him. He is a man of principle.
The title reads: "The largest and most complicated biological research project in existence."
The wooden trap swells with motion, let you taste the air. An instant, like fire, blows down.
"Good lord..." You feel the young woman's hand on your shoulder: her touch is cold and soft.
"Good luck finding your badge, though. It's probably just a lost jacket, or a broken mug..."
"He'll see the door at the other side. Right when he steps through the big door up there..."
"I don't deserve this. I don't deserve anyone. I never wanted you to know what I didn't do."
"I don't know what it is, and it doesn't interest me. Why would I have even wanted to know?"
"I don't want to do this. I'm afraid of making some poor people's work look like *my* work."
"I'm assuming you're *probably* the only person on this planet who's ever been to the moon."
"I'm sorry, detective. I cannot divulge any information about the case we're investigating."
"I've been thinking -- what if I was to open this thing up, so that I could somehow *grow*?"
"I've done my best to avoid failure, but I'm not going to do my best to avoid failure here."
"Look, he's trying to woo us with cop science. Forensics shit. I've heard this mambo jambo."
"No problem, officer." He taps his friend on the shoulder. "There's nothing to worry about."
"Not so fast... we're on the job of *three* people. To keep the place from going to *hell*."
"Of course, the Entity..." (Close your eyes.) "I didn't see her, but I sensed her presence."
"Okay..." The lieutenant doesn't know what to say, and his eyes are just wide with surprise.
"That's just a cop fantasy, a story to tell yourself while you sit on your ass in the cold."
"To be honest, not really. There are too many moving parts. Everything is a *jumbled* mess."
"We're not fools, we know the law. We should be... let's look around, see what we can find."
"WELL." He seems satisfied with the outcome. "I think we got everything. A word, detective?"
"Yes. I'm going to leave this out of my report and I suggest you leave it out of yours too."
"Yes. Like a deck of cards..." He turns to you. "This is just a wreath. I was making it up."
"You're right, it's really quite nice. But don't get me wrong: this building is really old."
*An* initiative, I have to say. (Wink at Kim.) No? Okay, so I was *bewitched* the other day.
...you need to stop now. You're just prolonging the time. Go on, keep the love in your life.
A little? You're so small, and the fat guy in the middle is wearing you. The rest *must* be.
A small piece of the dead man's hair falls off the branch -- it's long and very thread-like.
Behold, the poor sap. He's the *lord* of his workers. They are the real heroes of his story.
The lieutenant looks at the water lock. "I think... I saw a little *gay* on the other side."
The man in the sunglasses looks up at the sky, his mouth mute and his eyes moist from sleep.
The sight of bullet holes stirs something in you... perhaps there's pity? For you, at least.
What was that about the musk and the bottle? You're not a *goddamn* detective, you're a cop.
You are trying to remember nothing, but there's no stopping it either. You're hallucinating.
You can hear the wind gulp through it's damp metal doors, heavy as the weight of a mountain.
You have only a weak grip on the handgun, but your arm moves without breaking into a twitch.
"Don't be *too* dramatic, but the wind is blowing now. We should find another way to talk."
"Don't be afraid... the world is full of things. It's just that this one's... not like us."
"I do..." He shrugs. "It's a question of priorities. A matter of *how* to protect yourself.
"I think he was upright after the fall -- someone had to carry him. A heavy duty dead man."
"I think I understand it. The corpse is decomposing in the yard. It's *dying* to be eaten."
"I was actually aiming for the military-grade Rehm Rational series, but couldn't find one."
"I'm a little afraid we're here. I think our conversation about this business is finished."
"I'm done with this..." He's almost done with the story -- but then he thinks better of it.
"It's not going down! Not in *my* town, not in my riverside *park*, not even on my façade!"
"No, it was *his* body. That's what it is. He was rotting by then. The smell was terrible."
"No, it's for buying a fucking heel!" He shudders. "I was only trying to get mad at you..."
"Of course, officer, I mean I hope I can." He nods enthusiastically. "What's on your mind?"
"Oh... we don't actually have a reason. Just a hateful old woman. She... hates the police."
"Okay, *eel*, I'm sure you've been in enough trouble with this place for now. Are we done?"
"Please don't escalate things. We still have the means but not the motive. Only the facts."
"Safest of the lot! Seriously, what's there to say? The most fucking stupid thing is that."
"Stop calling me *the police*, detective. I don't want to hear about your weird daydreams."
"Thank you, dear. Now about all we were supposed to do in this apartment... What a relief."
"The wooden walls are not going to be painted red any time soon. This one's in good shape."
"Then go ahead, officer." She turns to you. "You got this. It's still *considered* a joke."
"We're not going to get into the *craziness* of this, I promise. I just can't get into it."
"What would a *real* person say about you?" the woman says with amusement. "You're a joke."
"Yes, I know. Big one." He looks around. "The guy was alright. Troubled but -- a nice guy."
"You are welcome," she says to herself. "I hope you would be less *intellectual* about it."
"You did well," the lieutenant says. "You are a considerable contributor to the community."
"You're welcome. We certainly have nothing against the Union." He gives you a small salute.
It may be that this one little ring is the one that matters. He means the *economic* thing.
It seems like she doesn't know where to put your hands or the strength to stand on a ledge.
It's just you -- a shadow in the corner of an alleyway like a leaf dropping from the trees.
Like a kid who's just discovered the ice cream they're going to get right this very second.
She was only going to leave the village when she first arrived, or so he's telling himself.
Ssssssire, you don't need to do this. You're the king and you've got everyone in the world!
Take it easy. Don't let the memory of old fall foul on the occasion of this great ugliness.
The lieutenant sighs. "I'm going to get to it. But don't worry -- I'm always here for you."
The man looks away from the window at the waves and the lights cast by the motor carriages.
Wait... what is *wrong* with you? Are you doing this... It's not *you*. You're an intruder.
You know what? Fine. Maybe I don't even care. It's not the end of the world, just a detour.
You put your hand on a hole in the ceiling tile. It's old. The tile has been there for ages
"...so I'm stuck here. All these ghosts are having trouble communicating with each other."
"But you're a big star, Harry. You're the mayor. It's your job to keep the city in order."
"Could your best friend, Kim, have sex with this form? No way. Not that I like the *you*."
"Doesn't like that song you've got going on at the AM. Want the tape? Here you go, piggy."
"I don't think they should follow the rules of the market -- I just want to talk to them."
"I'm afraid you can't, officer." She looks around. "I don't even know what this place is."
"I've only heard negative things about it. No one wants to hear what you have to tell me."
"If it helps, I may have another question about Klaasje. Do you have any other questions?"
"It's a shame, too. What would we all do without law enforcement. But, as I was saying..."
"Mr. Du Bois! Every worker -- member of the board!" He smiles the most peculiar of smiles.
"No, it's not. No one is coming. Not after this shit." He looks around. "Get out of here."
"No, you mean the mute, stone-faced woman? No, she's not me... I don't remember *anyone*."
"No, you're not. If you were I would have shot you myself. This is where the arrow lands."
"No. I don't think you have the stomach for it. Maybe you should stick to something else."
"No..." He looks to the island. "I want to turn back to the mainland. What is this place?"
"Sure, let's get to it." (If she's interested in going home, keep waiting for her answer.)
"The fuck does that mean?" He squints his eyes at you. "Come on, let's *take* your badge."
"There are four in total. One is to your right, behind you." He points with his cigarette.
"There's a..." the man says, waving his hand in the air. "A G-Bag-Man. Stuff's fucked up."
"They were in a war. Fighting a war. Someone shot him -- it was the best chance to spare."
"This has moved so far beyond your inial point. I'm not sure where this is going anymore."
"We're not doing anything! The woman is just *there*, her absence is a *key* to the case."
"Well, here we are! You'll love them *any* way. They'll fit in here." (Point at the door.)
"What?!" The lieutenant rises slightly, his forehead shiny from sweat. He takes your hand.
"Yeah, like you've been up against ceramic armour..." He tilts his head to the other side.
"Yeah... *I* did it, but only in the name of my company. I just need to get back to work."
"You have *many* questions -- but I need no help getting to the bottom of *this* mystery."
"You've lost your shit." He cracks his neck. "The police need your gun for investigation."
A grey envelope falls out of the basket: "Mail Delivery Box, Aktion, Swindle, Martinaise."
But we are not children, exactly. We are adults. And at this point -- you are an amnesiac.
Her eyes are fixed on you, over the washbasin. As you moved a little closer you noticed...
It's not the usual *vigilante behaviour* you see a police officer doing in this situation.
Just lay your hands on the phasmid, pretend you're the Carpenter and pretend to be afraid.
She covers her face with her hands, shaking her head, then covers her nose with her index.
Six feet under the desk, he's wearing thick polymer socks, probably for the wrong reasons.
Someone has to do it for him. He's broken, but that doesn't mean you should stop doing it.
The 'gigantic' man stands there, waiting for instructions. It's like he has a blank stare.
The lieutenant is relieved to know he's been right -- but barely contained his excitement.
The young man in the picture is not handsome and is not supposed to be singing or dancing.
You suspect it's *man from Hjelmdall* or somehow related being -they're* cross-referenced.
You're a joke to Cuno. A lampshooting clown who thinks he's a superstar. What's your deal?
"... because you're a bad ass. I gave you that gun, hope to god I don't have to do it..."
"A shame that I don't have a vision..." He turns to you. "What is your fucking *vision*?"
"And by 'these people' I mean people in Soona's radio game company -- Fortress Accident."
"Don't worry, Kim, I'm just here to help. If you need anything I'll be right behind you."
"Don't worry, Kim. I'm just gonna go back to the damn station and repeat that I'm a cop."
"I don't know -- could this Beaux Arts guy be the weirdo who's built Electric Boomboxes?"
"I knew it. "The lieutenant looks up at the blue door. "We should step outside and talk."
"I'm not, though." Her smile is dry as the Sahara. She doesn't look up from the keyboard.
"It's not like the people of Revachol are racist. All people are just bad at their jobs."
"Nine months ago, when the rich hag came in on her galley. Her honour guard came in tow."
"No, no," the old woman exclaims sharply. "Annette, yes. Nancy, yes. I don't miss you..."
"No, the surgery was very good. You should have more than 80% -- this man was a warrior."
"Of course, it's only a matter of time. I'm going to get back to you. God, forgive me..."
"That sounds like the name of a family business, don't you think?" she asks with a smirk.
"The moment I get back I'll immediately ring up the station and report my badge missing."
"The tip of the peninsula is bound to have a good view." He nods confidently. "Let's go."
"Yes. Quite." Her earrings tangle in the wind. "That's what I've heard. From the *whom*."
"You need to understand that *nothing* is going to happen. I'm just going to stand here."
"You're a better man now -- and in a better place -- and that's all *me* can do for you."
"Your friend is a lorry driver. He *is* responsible for the village. He's not a bad guy."
Alright, alright... not gonna push it. Too late. There are other, better ideas out there.
He looks at the corpse. "I'm not going to do anything now. I'm just going to stand here."
His fast pace makes it hard to meet your eyes when he makes his way over to the mattress.
Not really, it's just the usual suspects. Some more "cool" types. And we keep forgetting!
Now you're just flicking this shit away, because there's no fucking talent on the planet.
Okay, so this is what is called a *conversation*. You don't have to be guarded right now.
Okay. Good call! Never get stuck with your bad ass morals again. Time to make a decision.
The door is dark and a little more damp. With a little more of your body you can open it.
The tall ginger on his left shoulder gives you a weary smile. "Gotta get the fire going."
Your mind, on the other hand... you don't *feel* comfortable talking about your feelings.
"Cop himself said: 'This is not going to be more than five minutes of into a *portal*!'"
"Cuno, are you going to let me work when a *bitch* gets shot a thousand times a second?"
"Did you know that the *mad-house* is in the basement of Building B? It's... dangerous."
"Don't worry, Harry, for when I get up there all I'll see are broken pieces of plastic."
"I can't quite fathom the idea of the discarding of a weapon for some *eclectic* music!"
"I chose Iliad to represent the verb. Became passive with age -- dog not come home yet."
"I don't know what to say to that. I'm just a young woman. I'm trying to do a good job."
"I don't." He takes his glasses off. "I'm not gonna entertain you with this any longer."
"I think you said the union is all over the place. You said the Union is all fucked up."
"I was told that there's a huge fridge in the building's cellar. Can you lead me there?"
"I'm sorry, sir. It's not often that the RCM receives the recognition that it deserves."
"It could have been someone else, from the station -- they probably have a recording..."
"It's not *organic*, it's self-referential..." He smiles, looking at the fridge display.
"My mother's name is Maria, my wife's name is Janet and my children's name is *Iona*..."
"Not a magic word. Even in the realm of science, we can't see things through the glass."
"Of course, I'm not going to waste more of your time. Let's keep the rest to ourselves."
"Of course, let us dispatch with the formalities, you call me Evrart, I call you Harry!"
"Officer, you will have given me the time of day. I would suggest we get a *live* start.
"Oh, no, you're not. We're here to do a thorough job. We can't just have *fun* with it."
"Okay. I think I understand what's going on here. It's the *hunch* of a young romantic."
"She's not a camp counselor, Dr. Kitsuragi. She's a pleasant, soft-spoken kind of lady."
"The rest are in some kind of..." He waves them in a circle. "It was a fucking funeral."
"What about it? They're not actually in the open. Like for a real police investigation."
"What do you think?" He's still looking at you. "Why are you so *malicious* about this?"
"Yes, my memory is *well* gone, officer..." She looks at you with the tiniest of smiles.
"You know, not being an artist, I am an expert in *non-visual* art. This is my *thing*."
"You're not getting to her," he says calmly. "This is the police, please open the door."
A single machine stands in the corner, watching over the crowd of people milling around.
But this is the one and only real world that has nothing in it -- the world of tomorrow.
Dear lord, god of objectivity, the man must be perpetrating some kind of *tycho* murder.
The woman looks at you, her hair carefully swept back in a ponytail. She seems very sad.
The young man looks at you, his nose wrinkled. A little bit of a smile crosses his face.
You hear a faint whistle. A pipe makes a satisfying rattle -- then the trap clicks shut.
Your fingers waste no time closing around the handle. You squeeze the handle, then pull.
"Ah, the guy who writes mysteries -- he's really cool. One that I'm really *loyal* to!"
"And you look like you don't bathe -- on principle," the woman scoffs. "Sucks for you."
"Hmmm... What's on your mind?" Her hands look around the room, searching for something.
"Huh?" She looks to the side. "You're *just* going to call it the QR-6? Sounds stupid."
"I have to ask -- what can *you* do for me that this bottle can't?" You raise the beer.
"I won't pay for that window... til a neighbor gives me an opportunity to clean it up."
"I'm not going to try to make you happy. I have trouble believing in any kind of love."
"I'm not really interested in the practice, I just like to solve crimes and feel good."
"I'm not that either, I'm not that old, I'm doing my *job*... I'm not even that sound."
"I'm sure there's *something* interesting there, but I can't give you a name just now."
"Identifying the cause of death is important to me, but there are *11 more days to go."
"Look at me, who'd want to have kids? That's not how a human being should live, right?"
"No, I'm not *stupid*. I'm not a communist. I'm a capitalist-Communist. I can take it."
"No, no. I don't think so. According to this I should wear a hat to complement my hat."
"Of course! It's the law. I mean, it's a *base* basis of law. That's my fucking job..."
"She told me about the *spooky* thing. That's just a coincidence. It's not *my* thing."
"That's okay. As long as you don't forget to report it, okay. Don't forget. I'm a cop."
"That's right! How can I help you, officer?" A friendly smile is reflected back at you.
"That's right." He nods. "A lot of people got hurt -- me too. But that's all I wanted."
"The *Ardent Cuno* brought his funky beat like it's meant for Cuno. Cuno's got a beat."
"There was nothing in our initial interviews, I'm afraid. The band asked us to identify
"They're not going to *get* it. They know what this place is cursed. They've got this."
"Under the boardwalk. There's a pier close to it... you could slip in and look around."
"Yeah, not *cool*. You're a piece of work too! WORKING WITH YOU I MEANS FUCKING IT UP!"
"Yes -- we're at the exit -- in the old apartment building." Kim points to the balcony.
"Yes! There's hope... a lot of famous people got famous late, or even after they died."
"Yes. The community centre, the harbour... I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance."
"Yes. You have the mentality of a maverick fighter -- use it to get ahead of the pack."
"Yesss." She frowns. "They don't want to play with me. They're older and play outside!"
"You know... I think I *did* do some *dirty* shit. Maybe I should ask for forgiveness?"
"You seem to have us pegged here, detective," the lieutenant says, tapping on the wood.
"You're lucky you got shot, 'cause I've a mind to tear you to pieces right now, but..."
*Large* guns. This is a good short distance. You can get to them quicker than a bullet.
A little. The details are blurry, but what's implied is that he was a male, not female.
Are you sure? You should check yourself for a pulse with the carbon monoxide detectors.
The citizenry will never know what this place means, our home -- this island of matter.
The kid's still in there. Don't let him get away -- go down, get the hell out of there.
You could try to impress her with some cool collector's goods, but that would be silly.
You got a problem? Then maybe you should get a really, really, REALLY, REALLY good one.
You have *done* well, yes. But you could have done a little more. That man was in pain.
Your legs are not yours to wield as a weapon. You have to ask them to speak, not *you*.
"AAAAAAAAGH! Think of me, Kid from the village, chop me up and feed me to the wolves!"
"As you know, my colleague, your husband, was found dead on the Martinaise boardwalk."
"Cuno, what is this?" The animal turns to you. Its limbs are starting to white through
"Games, you see. You got nothing to hide, are you? It's not *we* who keep him hidden."
"Give me a moment..." For a moment the lieutenant looks at the other side of the door.
"He was just a kid. I don't know why I did it. I'm not a *killer*..." He turns to you.
"Here's a warning. Slow down. This has nothing to do with the certifications process."
"I *have* an *incident* on my hand." He takes his coat sleeve off and hands it to you.
"I don't know. I think the *whorehouse* is supposed to be real bad. It's... not good."
"I shouldn't have backed him up at all. I should have told him to go home. I'm sorry."
"I want him to tell us who he is and why he's trying to kill us -- this is important."
"I'm not really feeling it in me any more... Oh, I don't suppose that'll ever happen?"
"I'm sorry I cannot do more today. I still have to take care of some technical stuff."
"It's just, well, you look more like a high-flying businessman than a police officer."
"Look at me -- I was fishing. I know what anodized aluminum is. That's why I have it."
"No, there wasn't a *woman* on the island, it was a chubby kid. What happened to him?"
"Now this is real Revacholian hospitality. That Garte must be half-kipt or something."
"Now we bring you the *reeds*." He picks up a piece of telephone cord and inspects it.
"Of course, of course, of course... What is..." (Rip out a copy of the autopsy pages.)
"Of course. The Citizens Militia. I don't do the role. I'm only here for information."
"Right..." She points over the bridge. "Right where this is going, and here we are..."
"So that you're *deep* in some spiritual retreats with this thing coming up on earth."
"So what you're saying, dear is it, that you've got the power? That you're in danger?"
"So you see it too? That my preposterous system is entirely implausible..." (Proceed.)
"Such an acute encephalopathy..." She looks down at you, then up into your old eyes...
"The -m-?" He bows to inspect the bullet. "Saw that, right? That's the bullet, right?"
"The universe is one huge dinner plate." He spits on the turf. "It's the whole world."
"They were advocates and soldiers of the Revolution, so it's not entirely surprising."
"This criminal mastermind is a real pain in the ass, but I'll do it. Not a bad thing."
"We come." The lieutenant turns to you. "What are we talking about here? Of course..."
"We're doing good here." She sighs. "You're helping us. Let's go -- we'll solve this."
"We've got a case to solve, but can't we just go and have a drink and see that thing?"
"World's most precious material, reserved for those she lets close enough to feel it."
"Yes, I know, yes!" He nods enthusiastically, then takes a sip of his beer and smiles.
"Yes, the transportation of the mega rich is extremely important to the ruling class."
"Yes... yes, it *was*. But I'm just not sure what to do with it either..." He squints.
"You know, maybe it's the *worst* thing in the world. I would never have done this..."
"You, you. Everyone else is going to the aerodrome. I just won't let you. Why's that?"
And she did... she even asked you to take it! You felt guilty, but never actually did.
He nods. "A bad idea. You'll get people killed. We're not here to play with toy guns."
That doesn't even come close to *covering* it up -- the bloodstains are still visible.
The metal doors seem like a lot of money. Or money-like. There *is* money behind them.
This is ridiculous. He just has *not* a lot of experience being a detective. Who knew?
You could sneak back -- later, when the lieutenant's gone. This has been a great idea.
"*5.9%*," he says, "that's not a lot. Let me add -- that's not a lot of *wet* water."
"Be right here." He gestures towards the roundabout. "Watch your ass in Cuno's town."
"Definitely. Secondly -- I can't believe the lawyer said *you* could save your self."
"Don't you ever wonder about life spinning out of a lot of stuff necessary for life?"
"I can't..." She takes a drag of her cigarette and looks around. "I can handle it..."
"I didn't do it. I have no idea who I am -- Harry. I don't *care* about my lost gun."
"I don't know who you mean, but it's definitely not a normal dance-floor experience."
"I don't know. They have their own rules, set in stone. It's just something they do."
"I had another question. It's *not* a psycho-sexual thing, it's more *I* and *we*..."
"I haven't even seen the cover yet. Nothing bad does. I don't care. What do you see?"
"I would like to ask you a few questions. Don't you have anything else to do for me?"
"I'm flattered, officer, but I don't know how to respond." She turns to face the sea.
"I'm not a gardener. I don't do that -- I don't even know how to do it on a *plant*!"
"I've heard that they may have started a war. In '08. Do you know how it came to be?"
"No, not at all. You seem to have, I don't know how many others..." She looks around.
"Of course, Detective Cousteau." He nods. "I'm your colleague, patrol officer Minot."
"Officer -- you're a lieutenant of the RCM -- you don't need to be... let's move on."
"Oh my god, I forgot to warn you. Gotta get to the harbour first. I don't have this."
"Positive change, huh?" He surveys the room. "But what does it *have* to do with it?"
"That's cute..." He waves his hands, but he doesn't say anything. "It's really cute."
"That's the yard." The lieutenant marks it down. "The other one is the * valid* one."
"The future belongs to Measurehead, my servant. I have no right to keep him waiting."
"There's a nameless old fishing village nearby, but that's a totally different world.
"This is where the lieutenant is from. Or he wouldn't have bothered me. If he *did*."
"Uhm... I don't know what you're talking about, officer. I don't even know her name."
"What do you think?" She tilts her head. "I'm not going to go fucking with the case."
"What? No, I need to finish this sentence. The rest of the story is inter-connected."
"Yes, this is my colleague. I need you to stop doing this to me by Sunday nightfall."
"You're a fucking coward, pig!" He shakes his head. "We're gonna get talked into it."
(Turn to Kim.) "Did we ever talk about this? Here's the tape we wanted to listen to."
...he looks at you as well as *you* look at him. Then, slowly, as if waking, he nods.
...then kills herself. In silence, her arms drop to her sides and her body goes limp.
He's a detective of the RCM -- not the military police, who go around killing people.
I remember a feeling -- being worried about crossing paths with someone in an armour.
She gives you a long, suspicious look. She's not really surprised, just disappointed.
So you don't know how! One little thing -- what did some of that smell *do* you know?
That's not really true. It's a weird meme. The guy with the big ears is just jealous.
The *rooster* is looking at you. It looks like you're about to start your own shadow.
The man has the *blue* ring around his necktie, like a ring bearing a small circle...
The man is shifting uncomfortably, the sweat on his brow rises and falls in his eyes.
The old woman looks far away, her face in the window. The snow melts on the window...
The player is holding his weapon -- the only thing keeping the door open is his head.
There's a silence. She looks at the rain streaming down the yellow belly of the boat.
There's a sudden, painful *pressing* in your gut. It's time to get your act together.
Titus was right -- it's impossible to be both a *social democrat* and a *capitalist*.
You're not going to be *unsuccessful*. There's a backdoor passage into the coal room.
"And then we performed a field autopsy on the victim. We didn't learn much, though."
"Because we're done with that nonsense, right? This is *all* real and *reasonable*."
"But... What if I told you all my friends *are* dead? How would they feel about us?"
"Glad to have been of assistance -- the little that I know. Anything else I can do?"
"Good, good, good," the lieutenant repeats, his eyes never leave the sunken vehicle.
"I can't say." The lieutenant looks at his notes. "I don't even know what it means."
"I don't know. It's a bit of a stretch. This is a bit of a *prairie* neighbourhood."
"I knew it." She lets out a long and happy sigh. "I'll be sure to keep it that way."
"I'll be damned. I'll be a real cop too. There's no such thing as a *cop* any more."
"I'll be sure to get in touch in the morning. I just have to get through the gates."
"I'll you going to do it? Don't be a jerk, cop. I know how to handle broken things."
"I'm gonna get fucked up too, by the way..." He looks around. "It's gonna be *bad*."
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid I can't give you any more information about the case."
"I've only seen a silhouette of one phasmid, but it's been a while since I've died."
"It's an example. Don't have it for evidence." He rubs his forehead with both hands.
"It's correct, officer." She points to the small dot on her keyboard. "Let's do it."
"It's the *last* thing I'll ever do. I can't have my eyes on me any more. I'm done."
"My wife and I just moved into a new house. We're looking forward to your new home."
"No, not just yet." He turns to you. "We have a murder case on our hands, remember?"
"Not unusual," the lieutenant replies, walking away with his notebook under his arm.
"Not yet, sir! I have a long way to go, a long way to go before I'm in your league."
"Of course, *blood*," he nods. "Anyway, I don't know about that. Is it *invisible*?"
"People are just scared of the truth." She looks around. "What do you want to know?"
"So I just got a *little* drunk myself this morning -- maybe the *desperate* thing."
"That's nice. But there is another, right next door. The right door of the kitchen."
"The best thing to do is to drop by around the corner, and see what's up the sewer."
"This is bullshit, man. The fuck is that?" He looks at the couch. "What does it do?"
"We're not cops. Look, Cuno..." He sticks his giant index finger right in your face.
"Whoa." He leans in, his nose brushing against the counter top. "What're you doing?"
"You say... like someone left their small animal alive on the ice for a week or so."
'Urban coastline, rain dripping off eternite runs...' She closes her eyes, and nods.
A former coal plant worker looks down at his boots, then up into the sky. He smiles.
How come you're letting this kid go? He's obviously one your lover hid the key from.
Perhaps you should see if you can *smell* pétanque with the person who did the work.
She's just flirtating with you. She's high-concept, not your kind of police officer.
The lieutenant looks over his shoulder for a moment, before taking out his notebook.
The lieutenant stands in front of you, casting a appraising glance at the buildings.
The lieutenant's right. He's probably made his fair share of mistakes along the way.
There's no reply. Only silence lurks in the cavernous depths of the darkness beyond.
What if... you *are* an incredibly elite detective, able to read lips from the dead?
"A real man's man's man," he nods with pride. "Let's get *down*." He waves you off.
"Can you try to answer my questions now?" The lieutenant pushes down on your wound.
"Cops come every day to kill people, and they want me to put on a goddamn uniform."
"Hell. *I* don't remember what it's for, but I know it's a dangerous line of work."
"I *am* a police officer. Why would I treat another person like they didn't exist?"
"I can't help you with this right now. I need something else, something *extra*..."
"I don't know. I'd do it anyway -- I just don't wanna make people uncomfortable..."
"I have no problem with *alcoholic* beverages. I don't even drink with my friends."
"I knew it." The lieutenant says it as if it's obvious. "We need to open the door."
"I'm not. I'm not coming anywhere -- and you're not taking me there. Now fuck off."
"It's my job to protect the people of Revachol, not push them aside because of me."
"It's not *any* kipt, it's..." He looks around. "Cuno's got nothing to do with it."
"Maybe I used to be just like that guy. Maybe I used to be *just like* that guy..."
"No, he didn't like her. He's just a killer. And he doesn't want her to be around."
"No, we don't. We're just cops." He leans back. "You should take care of yourself."
"No-no, we're not looking for a drummer. We're looking for a group of dockworkers."
"Oh, I've been meaning to have a little chat with you about your sense of *style*."
"Oh, so that's what this is about. You know someone who's allegedly into cryptids?"
"Rest assured, detective, that *you* are not a *thief*. This is a *police* matter."
"Sir, you're already connected to the 57th Precinct." Her voice is firm and sudden.
"The only way to get the body out of the yard is to break it open from the inside."
"The war is over! There will be no more fucking war! Police officers need to work!"
"There's a difference between saying something crude -- and an ideological racist."
"This is an opportunity to send a strong and *unconditional* message to the world."
"Wait until you see what the Lieutenant has found in there..." (Point to a podium.)
"We've met Joyce, but didn't *quite* get to her yet -- we still have to ask her..."
"Yes, we know who you mean." The lieutenant points at the scribbles. "Where is he?"
*I* think he might be referring to himself as *you*.  So that's what this is about.
A feeling of great accomplishment. Maybe you should do it again while you're drunk?
AND "YOU HAD A BULLETH. A GUL. SOME SAY IT WAS HER LIVING HEART THAT WERE CRUSHED."
He looks at the pile of papers on the table and sighs. "Three letters in a row... "
I don't know, the slimy stuff hiding behind the counter feels comforting somehow...
Sounds like he wants someone to do something when they've got those raining around.
The bullet had barely left its mark, and the bullet was *still* lodged in the wood.
The doorbell is far away, but you can hear the speaker's laughter behind your feet.
The greatest motherhood is the birth of a sire, and a contented tongue the result."
The lieutenant looks like he's about to go. His hands are clean and well-manicured.
The lieutenant nods. "I hope I didn't have to set up shop in a shithole like that."
The lieutenant nods. "Me and Ernie are friends. He's always been kind and helpful."
The man is about to say something, but there's a silence, as the woman continues...
The man keeps turning to you. In his mind, you're somehow *connected* to this case.
"An old woman? On a motor carriage? No, look at me! Here's the police." He laughs.
"Beats me." She stares at the embers, slowly. The sentence has passed on her lips.
"C'mon, man, don't say anything. We just have to get back to the Intrepid's base."
"Damn, I thought I could hear the boom. It's like a trap. We should move quickly."
"Get out of here, pig! Cuno ain't dealing to the popo. Not into this psycho shit."
"Good talk." The man nods. "I'm sure they'll understand what you're trying to do."
"He does." He nods. "I tried to rattle him -- a little. But he was too jacked up."
"He was like a walking, talking fish." She chuckles. "I'd said that before too..."
"Hmh..." a hum, the air in the room feels warm as the sun warmly paints the coast.
"I am Rescueman, Rescueman of the state of the Occident, surrounding by the pale."
"I can't may be wrong, but it feels like someone has turned the light on in here."
"I don't know what you're talking about, but maybe it's better not to mention it."
"I don't really know... I just came to open the door. How the hell did I open it?"
"I haven't been drinking. That's for my husband. And I'm not separating from him."
"I'll wait here for a moment -- we have to finish the main business before we go."
"I'm glad we're getting this sorted out. Anything else I can help you with today?"
"I'm sorry, detective. I shouldn't be here. I should go get something else to do."
"I'm sorry, I don't think that's the right thing to do. Maybe you should ask her?"
"I've been in a lot of coffee shops over the years, but this one is my favourite."
"No, at least not as far as we know. You seemed to be caught in some sort of *loop
"No, I didn't." The lieutenant looks at you with a curious expression on his face.
"Not much, I understand. It's just... a little *hollowing out* here at the moment.
"That's no crap. I'm not trying to be *spooky*. This is something I *want* to do."
"The Man from Hjelmdall is dead, supposedly, but was their *revolutionary* dream?"
"The remaining tranquilism will disguise a wretched murderer. I need to name him."
"There are three layers of hell here. I'm afraid we have to start with the first."
"There's a strange man in the corner of the church that keeps... staring at me..."
"What I want to know is, how have you managed to stay sober for more than a week?"
"Why would someone cut their losses like this?" His face goes red as a coal plant.
"Yes, but..." She looks around. "She's not a prostitute. We have a *family* here."
"Yes, Harry." He looks stern. "What can you tell me about the man who lives here?"
"Yes. The Revachol Citizens' Militia. I belong to the *hard core* side of things."
"Yes. There was no trying to smash through the window. That's why it didn't work."
"You mentioned it *in* Revachol. There it is, not far, not far behind the castle."
HOWEVER YOU ARE, YOU MUST BE FOUR-TONED TO FEEL THE ORGANISM THAT IS IN YOUR BODY.
If it's easy, there's a *tiny bit* of truth on the table. Zoom in on the rosemary.
It's simply a matter of recognizing that cause and effect work in both directions.
She's ready to burst open the door of the vehicle. The lieutenant's ready to help.
The man in the uniform says to the officer: "Please, help! Someone's been hanged!"
The woman on the photo does not reply. She looks at you with strange indifference.
There is a moment of silence. It seems like even a longer one has been speaking...
You see: a photo, an engraving, a little blue pencil, and a little more than that.
"And *there* was a huge fucking hole in the roof, where the building used to be."
"Back-up? She's a whipper-in-a-dice type. Her stuff is made to be untrustworthy."
"Didn't Titus say something?" the lieutenant asks, looking at you with suspicion.
"Forget about it. I'm no genius. I'm not even *scared* enough to drink with you."
"Fucking *shit*..." The old man's left hand starts tapping his foot, impatiently.
"Good." He looks at you. "And then some cockatoo might have eaten a little shit."
"I don't have an opinion on employing teens, I just want to know -- did it work?"
"I just said I'm sorry. What more do you want me to say? I'm not going anywhere."
"I like the way the punks look at you, detective. You're a better cop than them."
"I'll live on the street!" He seems to relax a bit. "I want to change the world."
"I'll take a look at the corpse then. See if there's anything interesting there."
"I'm sorry, Cuno, but it's not enough. I want to know who's the real *criminal*."
"I'm sorry, detective. I don't mean to get into the details of this case, but..."
"It would be easier if you wasn't so hard on yourself... It's an acquired taste."
"It's just a glorified street lamp with reflection off, and everyone's terrible."
"It's morning outside, you think." He looks at the sunlit coast across the water.
"It's not even a crazed freak anymore -- a chimp, a bad ass, a disgusting human!"
"No you're not. It's a waste of everyone's time." He shakes his head. "Let's go."
"No, what I'm describing is *real*. It's *as* real as you can get in this world."
"No, you don't deserve to die. You do this job for yourself. It's not mandatory."
"No. These *Bourgonde*... I don't know. It's a… I don't know what to say to you."
"Oh, I'm sorry, I don't really know what that means." He looks up at the ceiling.
"Okay, I understand. It's good to know someone knows what they're talking about."
"She told us you were by no means a police officer, that she was merely a local."
"Thank you, you're *an expert*. Why didn't you give me your *real name* earlier?"
"That's why I don't like to deal with the Alcoholics. They're trying to fuck us."
"There's no rush to find out who he is. You might want to rethink your approach."
"This is a *medical* case. I could help you get to the bottom of it. Ask around."
"What about," he looks up, "Is it already too late? We should have arrested her."
"Why are you not fucking shitting yourselves -- what's wrong?!" He glares at you.
"Yeah, I'm really going now, I'm gonna leave stuff out of the trash can for you."
"Yeah, wrong again." The tattooed man shakes his head, laughing. "Right there..."
"Yes, I know that we can't stop an amateur like that. I was worried for my life."
"Yes, it's me." She looks at you with her cold blue eyes. "I'm sorry about that."
"Yes. It was so late. After midnight. I had to be on the 10:20 flight at my age."
"You know, I think the only *real* police officer is the one I've *experienced*."
"You're not doing very well, dear. It doesn't look like you're emerging from it."
"You're not telling me what to do. I'm not getting into this right now." [Leave.]
"You're right, I don't." The lieutenant looks up from his notes. "What was this?"
He turns to face the sea, standing on a wooden planks. His eyes are open, wide...
She turns back to you: "And now the only way to get in is through the union box."
This is only a half-assed explanation, he doesn't know what you're talking about.
This is the water lock on the Martinaise Canal, the lock of the Whirling-In-Rags.
You didn't pass the *basic moral calculus*. You're on a different plane entirely.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but do you know who is living in the apartment?"
"Fuck, I don't know what got into me, officer." She looks off into the distance.
"Good." He looks at the sandwich in your hands. "I-know-you're-not-guessing-it."
"I could be wrong, but what's this boulder thing you live on next to the canal?"
"I don't know. Klaasje gave me a similar garment. Maybe it's the one they wear."
"I have a library card from the RCM. Should you have any more questions for me?"
"I know he's gone, but he was a cool dude. He had a lot of fun with the baby..."
"I like to think I'm a decent human being. I don't let myself think about this."
"I owe you an apology. But more pressing, is the investigation still pending..."
"I think I've cracked the case. Do you know what's behind the black containers?"
"I'll be there when you get the time -- maybe we should talk about someone else"
"I'm gonna have to stop you there, Leo, but you still have my full cooperation."
"I'm not sure what 'Ah-ha* is, but it's a very amusing name. What do you think?"
"I'm sorry, officer. The information I need is no longer here. This one's gone."
"I've known her for a couple of years, but am only vaguely acquainted with her."
"If the lieutenant is in the room, he must have a lot of business to attend to."
"In the tiny town that's the only place in the world that has a question mark in
"It's a common Revacholian expression. The locals have a different term for it."
"It's gone for now." She takes a drag. "You're not getting me to talk about it."
"It's not *that*. Let's just go with the flow. Let's do with this what we will."
"It's not just that. You and I are the same person. I am yours and yours alone."
"Maybe, but it's weird. Weird and lonely are the only words I can come up with."
"No, no, that's incorrect. I am a rational man. You and I are perfectly normal."
"No, you don't get to choose your posse, they choose you. So where's the mercy?"
"No. That's not me any more. I am just a regular cop now. Regular law official."
"That's right, I heard." He nods confidently. "It put the 'loco' back in 'locop'
"This is by far from the best place to hide something, but I'll think about it."
"Well, I guess you have my permission to be a little more humble, I understand."
"What would *you* have done if I hadn't thrown an empty container in your face?"
"Whoa! There's a body right in your face from across the lake! Good stuff, man."
"Yeah, like you've been in the store a long time. The memories are still fresh."
"Yes, a lot of bullets did go in. Six were aimed for my partner. They missed..."
"Yes, but the *who*? The real question is: "What is it? Why is this happening?""
"Yes," she concedes. "Every piece of trash on the street smelled of cigarettes."
"You probably have a hundred million dollars. Just a hundred million right now."
"You seem to be in some sort of trouble. Maybe I can help you, I'm a policeman."
"You're right. Harry, you've been doing just fine." He stares into the tuna can.
"You're the one who's missing. That's not how cop things work around here, yes?"
A bitter cringe. It *hurts*. You look straight through the heart of your friend.
A peculiar posturing. This is unusual -- the dweorgr have no house, and no land.
The lieutenant raises an eyebrow, indicating you've exceeded the *limbo effect*.
The old man looks at the water lock, then the lieutenant: "You're welcome, sir."
You know what this is -- the *ultimate* reward. A rare, precious, mythical item.
You know, that's kind of odd -- that she'd be so calm about something like that.
You see the outline of a woman's breasts. She's really, really excited about it.
"A commodity. The most expensive one in the world, but not the most expensive."
"And here I was thinking *no one flew into the ocean*. This must be... stupid."
"Are you *sure* it's Hedger? In a good house? Or the dog you shot. The tree..."
"But you can't. You're *not* going to get it right. You're gonna get it wrong."
"Fuck me... fuck me..." He tries to shake it off, the room burns and it's cold.
"He was taken away to a psychiatric ward -- what happened next is beyond me..."
"I met these guys outside the Whirling-In-Rags. I knew they were *bad people*."
"I think he was upright after death. His hands, feet and neck are discoloured."
"I'm sorry for what I said, I shouldn't have gone as far as I did. You know..."
"I've been meaning to have a little chat with you about your sense of *style*."
"It's a pretty dark and ragged little alley, really. All the lights are off..."
"It's not too big a deal on the inside, you know. That isn't our main concern."
"Maybe I should look into that guy. Sounds like a little conflict of interest."
"Music series driver? You're not a musician, I have no interest in your music."
"No, I don't have that." He looks down. "I'm not going to be a *cop* any more."
"No, I don't want to kill him. I just wanna hear what's going on in the world."
"Thank you. I hope you find your way through your own troubles now." (Proceed.)
"This is a serious matter. Stop talking about this. What did you want to know?"
"Truth be told, the idea of selling your own human organs is quite horrifying."
"Wait!" The lieutenant raises his eyebrows. "Are you saying you *cut him* off?"
"Wait, what are we gonna do now, go inside, find the rest and have a nice day?"
"We could not have had a single cryptid -- not then." He looks toward the yard.
"Well, it's been a while since I've gone hunting for the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua..."
"Yeah, why not?" She's smiling. "It's a good name. That's all I wanted to say."
"You *are* talking about something other than the murder weapon. What is that?"
"You know what? No. I'm not sorry -- I don't need pity. You should *fuck off*."
"You mean the alphanumeric -- officer, precinct, time of arrival at the scene?"
"You see, my victim was *naturally* tall. It was just a matter of proportions."
"You'll be in-between jobs soon! Get out, this instant!" He points at the door.
"You're not serious! Please don't ask me questions in front of my dead friend!"
Don't be afraid of the curse. They're only trying to help you. All four of you!
It is. The tree is the most direct route to the wheel, and it's pretty obvious.
The lieutenant is not going to like the answer. He's not going to like it much.
You have nothing to add. Just relax in this situation. The wind will carry you.
You're not choosing any pointless side in this petty struggle. There's no hope.
"...then goes back downstairs, passes the waiter and says: "I'm ready. Whooh."
"Ah, what do you want from me? Don't you want to talk about *something else*?"
"Got it. About the business... *how* do you know it's the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?"
"I can tell that this is taxing for you, so I'll just ask you some questions."
"I could have sworn I saw the same woman a few days ago, but not like this..."
"I'll wait for my turn. I don't want to waste any more time with you, my man."
"I'm sorry, sir, I forgot to use jacuzzi for my guest. Still, I'm glad I did."
"It is not *proto* whatever you believe in. What you are, is a *sub-rosaeno*."
"It's just a message for the workers," she explains, her voice strangely calm.
"It's said. Let me make it very clear that I wasn't sexually assaulted, okay?"
"Look, there's this huge crane that's shiny. I'm tempted to get a prize then."
"Morell is quite high on it. He's on a *vintage* speed. We're all high on it."
"No, I don't." She turns to you. "You *will* respect me. You will respect me!"
"Of course, I mean I hope I can." He smiles pleasantly. "What's on your mind?"
"Of course," she curtsies slightly. "You are. Anything else I can do for you?"
"Oh yes. He's a true believer too. His belief makes the world a better place."
"Oh, no, that's not..." (Look around.) "You're not gonna believe this, but..."
"Put Cuno's fucking pills in that shit. Cuno can't handle Cuno's Cuno's Cuno."
"Thank you for clearing that up, officer. Have you had enough 'splainin' yet?"
"That's [sic] what he said, officer -- he said *you're* not from around here."
"The hull was removed, like a corpse. I don't even know what to say about it."
"This *is* evidence of post-traumatic stress. And I can't even get it off me."
"This is so you can get back to the man you just *surrendered* to the guns..."
"Wait, so there *is* another person living in the church -- and it's a woman?"
"We should search downstairs. There is a door that leads up, and to the roof."
"What is this?" the lieutenant says excitedly. "It's got to be *really* good."
"You can't get *too* sensitive about your head size here... No one's perfect."
"You could always ask the union to join in if they get tired of your *worry*."
"You know, maybe you should rethink your drinking habits if you get this far."
"You seem to have spent a lot of time thinking about the political situation."
"You're right, I'm not --" The woman on the photo does not seem to understand.
His tone is skeptical. "I don't believe it, but -- you see -- it is possible."
In essence, her hope is to *revitalize* the locality by throwing tourists off.
Make no mistake about it -- this is a potentially fatal injury for the victim.
She doesn't seem to be lying -- she's genuinely spooked by your disappearance.
She has a look on her face, but doesn't say anything. But she is *very* alive.
She's still here, knows you remember her? Still sends out that silent warning.
The general store has a huge stock of batteries. You should take half the box.
The lieutenant looks at his notes. "Her methods are not *unusual* or unusual."
There's a small piece of plastic on the side. You see a small grid of letters.
There's definitely a *big toaster* in the oven -- maybe you should heat it up?
This is not good. You need to present something coherent here. Make your case.
Voilà, now the family business is dead. Even the small shop must be shut down.
Why do you keep listening to this thing even after you've told him to leave...
You already know what it really is. You've seen it before... It's *the* sign!*
You really shouldn't, he says. It's just a little -- *nothing* is going wrong.
"All right. But I have another question. Something I can't quite figure out."
"Aye, you're right." The lieutenant smiles. "I'll see you around, detective."
"Did he show you around, learn something? I've had so many fucked up days..."
"How did you know? It's just a book." She shrugs it off. "It's on the shelf."
"I don't think I've ever heard anything less relevant to your investigation."
"I know this sounds ridiculous, just go. But it's true. I did see something."
"I mean it's supposed to be *the most dank* party place I've ever been to..."
"I need information, not a puzzle. You can't put a dead body into my fridge."
"I think I got it." He points at the big box. "It's called your *favourite*!"
"I told Joyce it's boring. She said it's what a *bourgeois* is. Very trendy."
"I won't show it to you. Don't show it to me. I don't *need* you to do this."
"I'm not a *race pupil*. I didn't take you for one second. You *are* police."
"I'm not going to take this. I'm going to take it. I'm going to kill myself."
"I'm not sure I can even *describe* it. I'm just going to call it *B-Grade*."
"I'm sorry, detective. I can't be an *insane* communist. I'm not fitting in."
"It must be..." He looks around. "Someone has begun moving furniture around."
"It's called a *Type* 30, yeah. And that's where the toy factory is located."
"It's made of velvety toffee wrapping that's been preformed in the moulding."
"It's not. It's for pansies. *I* don't rule here. I'm an officer of the law."
"Maybe I should ask you to stop beating yourself up about this stupid thing?"
"Maybe we should stop going on then? Doesn't it become tiring after a while."
"No, not exactly." He looks at the corpse. "A different shot. Like a *shot*."
"Not that they should know, of course... But they *will*. Because they will."
"Oh, you don't remember anything -- you sure of anything?" He rolls his eyes.
"Regret, but could you help me with something important? I hope you find it."
"Shh... just give me a second, I'm almost..." She clocks up her typing speed.
"That said, I think she has a quite the sense of humor, part of her is that."
"That's enough." The lieutenant took the body down from the tree. "Let's go."
"The cop who shot him, use the *speed* trick? And the *man with sunglasses*?"
"The Lieutenants are the most *pale* of the quartet, let's get used to that."
"Tsk... tsk..." She lets out a chortle. "This is nothing but a piss-pig hat."
"We should go get our *two* cups. The coffee's been spreading like wildfire."
"What is this?" The policewoman looks up at you, her eyes filled with fear...
"What, it's just a metaphor? Like they're not real people. I am real people."
"Yeah shit! You better fucking fuckin' fuckin' than not make out like a ass."
"Yeah, sure. If you *really* think that, fine. Just not mine. Is that clear?"
"Yes. It's an *energy* industry and an energy company. It's *unpredictable*."
"You know, a lot of people out there appreciate a good run in the mountains."
"You must be -- you're middle class, don't you? Not the rich sort, you know?"
"You'd hate to tell my friend, but I'm not. Just guess you got away with it."
"You're right. I'm not gonna say anything more about it. Let's just move on."
"You're wrong. It's the very beginning of the game. You can't even start it."
A bald man turns toward a lean man and pats him on the back. "Hey, you! Hey!"
He is, and that is part of the pleasure. He is enjoying every second of this.
He looks at the empty bucket -- the corpse looks at his belly, conspicuously.
He looks at the shattered glass. "Cuno isn't here, am I? I don't know why..."
She looks you straight in the eye, her irises are light green, a pink shadow.
She's doing you a solid, this lady-cop. That's something to be very proud of.
The lieutenant nods. "Thank you again. I do appreciate your professionalism."
The lieutenant's grimace is more than a bit disconcerting in "Suit yourself."
The screen goes dark. The loudspeaker starts off -- a cigarette in your hand.
Yes, yes! You got that -- no one can see that you're scared to use the gun...
You can't be both a cop and a beer drinker. You're just not cut out for this.
"*Oh* you're right, we've got nothing to discuss." He nods. "Let's just go."
"AIIIIIGH!!!" he yells. You guess Egg Head won't become a fascist after all.
"And no, I don't think they should act on that basis. But... what do you do?
"C'mon, man, back up!" Her eyes flash with resentment. "Get down, choke it."
"Captain, I've heard enough about the squad I need to get back to the city."
"He had a history of mental illness, but he seemed to be in a better place."
"I am. Some of my clients have asked me to brief them on the union's plans."
"I don't know who she was, but the name makes it sound like she was a girl."
"I don't know, Emil, it was just a thought, right? From behind the curtain."
"I don't really know what I'm doing here. I just go wherever life takes me."
"I don't think I've ever heard anything less relevant to any investigation."
"I have no idea what you're talking about. I've never met a patient before."
"I just put my hand on my gun and hoped that it strokes a shadow one day..."
"I really don't know what I'm doing here. I just go wherever life takes me."
"I'd skip the first part and just answer that blackmail thing later, Harry."
"I'm a *gendarme*..." He looks around. "My name is Cuno, but I'm also Cuno."
"I'm not saying that I *am* Kras Mazov, I'm just saying that we look alike."
"I'm sure I'll be fine. I just wanted to make sure you understood my point."
"I'm sure I'll be luckier than you, friend." He grin is as wide as a desert.
"If it were an urgent situation, then by the book we would have to open it."
"It's for important police work. I just don't have time for it right now..."
"Maybe you're trying to make *some type of a deal with a certain suspect..."
"No trouble. I'm sure the locals know what you're hauling in your own lorry.
"No, it's a long-term plan. We need to create a new *normal* for this city."
"Of course, officer," he says with a smile. "Memories are all we have left."
"Oh yeah! Cuno's getting his act together, Cuno's making your dick explode."
"One last question -- aren't you afraid of *them* even? Fear of the coffin."
"So you think the strike is being funded with source ingredients for drugs?"
"Sure, officer. That's why we can't see Evrart's face when we get in there."
"Sure, why not. It's not like we have anywhere else to go in this hellhole."
"This has got nothing to do with... Oh well. We've got a hunch, that's all."
"This is also the only point of origin we haven't ruled out yet." (Proceed.)
"Unbrilliant. I like that. Leaving the Academy is bad news for most people."
"Well..." She looks around. "You're a police officer, after all. Who is it?"
"What's going on here?" The lieutenant is staring at you, hands on his hips.
"What's with the god damn Romangorans? They're more than they sound like..."
"Yes. This is your last chance -- and the odds of getting back what I will."
"You're basically saying it's a *lady* car... The right way to go about it."
"You're joking. By the way, where is this Al Gul -- where I lost my memory?"
"You're right. I strongly suggest you change your name -- it's *offensive*."
A small window breaks open on the wall, she's not smiling. What's happening?
He looks at you, heart-straddled and stuttering. "I don't know what to say."
I hope I've made the story more real and less melodramatic for the ladies...
Somewhere in the building, you hear a voice: "We must be looking for *Uwe*!"
That's just a small detail in one of *all* the strange things you've seen...
There are five of them. You have the makings of a human chain reaction here.
There is *no* resentment in her eyes. She really wants you to open the door.
"Aye, I feel much the same way. I've noticed that in the last week or two."
"Aye, you have the right attitude. What the hell do you think of the bear?"
"Can you help me get ahold of the owner of this kit?" (Hold up the PUZZLE.)
"Cuno wants to turn the city into a club, MC. Get the *funk* moving there."
"Don't worry, Kim. I'm not a good enough cop to ask her about her husband."
"Fine," she says, shaking her head. "We should go and get the *disco* now."
"Glad to have been of assistance -- the little that I know. Anything else?"
"He's been there for days, but you won't get far with this stink-festival."
"Hmmm, this doesn't look like the workers boots from the hanging, does it?"
"I can't even put it into words. You're right... I don't want to be a cop."
"I don't know what's so good about her, what is all of this. She's a girl."
"I don't know. I'm just gonna go say, do you want me to explain something?"
"I have explicit, absolute command over my brigade. I will make up for it."
"I just wanted to get up there and teeter over the edge. She could see it."
"I should have been able to control them. I will in the future. I promise."
"I think I *know* who this person is. I've come to ask you some questions."
"I will, coppo. That's our job. Just like our job is to find *the killer*."
"I'm an amnesiac cop. I probably did it and I can't even *remember* I did."
"I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, ma'am. I just want to know."
"I'm not sure there's anything else to say about this. Let's just move on."
"I... can't talk, too -- I just don't have the *conviction* here for this."
"It's bullshit." He rolls his eyes. "But I don't have time to investigate."
"It's not going to be our last night here, either. But, in the meantime..."
"Legal things. I'm not talking about the Union -- I don't know what it is."
"Like what?" She stops as her mind keeps on coming up with the wrong thing.
"No, not everyone is like this, I'm just afraid it will attract attention."
"Officer..." The man on the water lock picks up his beer and stares at you.
"Oh," he looks around. "I think not. I just don't know about one or two..."
"Okay, well..." He lowers his voice suddenly. "Now, I can tell you this..."
"That's what was in me. I wanted to play the blame game. I got to keep it."
"The survivor in question is one of the most beautiful women in the world."
"There are no *dukkies* in the RCM. Do your research -- if you're serious."
"There's a... hole in the wall. You can see into Klaasje's room from here."
"Wait, do I have to park here? The coffee counter is in the corner down..."
"Whatever it is, it's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a *radio*."
"Why?" He spreads his arms. "Eugene already told me you were on the coast."
"Yes, Vernon. This place isn't the most *polite* restaurant in Revachol..."
"You seem to have quite a lot of it, officer. Are you... *ever* satisfied?"
"You're *Tequila Sunset*. You have no idea about the cargo you're hauling."
A rain-soaked mattress on a concrete slab. Cold water drips from the eaves.
But you know what? The world could use some good cops like *you*, don't it?
Don't let the lieutenant make you feel bad. You just need to ask questions.
I'll get you back on track now. We're all working against our common enemy.
Lilienne is the name of the man who built all the schools in Revachol East.
She's been lying here for quite some time. She must have gotten wind of it.
The lieutenant shakes his head. "It's a big moose, too. It's a huge moose."
There's no mystery here -- the prybar is empty as far as thie is concerned.
You're kidding... Don't be stupid! You can't have your cake and eat it too!
Your voice sounds like a cry for help from the depths of your subconscious.
"A powerful anti-communist force. Perhaps *too* powerful... but still...."
"Before I went, I had to stop drinking. I wanted to be a *normal* person."
"Good luck with that. It's not easy to sweep a dead body off a staircase."
"Good. For the record -- it was some kids who called in for their *shit*."
"Hey, how do I get to the other side of these? I've been locked in there."
"How so? Just recently you were spotted with your pants down in the cold."
"I ... I didn't want to get in the way of that fucker. Cuno's my pig now."
"I am the law. I'm a detective. I'm doing a case. You can't fuck with me."
"I am. Yours to manage, even," the man nods. "What's the number, officer?"
"I am." (Nod.) "I've always believed in the race mystery. Mystery solved."
"I did not want to wake you -- perhaps I should have? Was it a job dream?"
"I don't know." She shrugs. "It didn't really matter to me what happened."
"I made sure I got everything together first. Now it's all ready to roll."
"I will make up my mind later. I have questions for you first." (Not now.)
"I'm going to buy that mask off some of you. Just ask me when you get it."
"I'm not going to lead you on." He takes his hat off. "It's not my thing."
"I'm sure I'll have a lot of questions. I know I have a lot of questions."
"I've already been there. It was an idiotic idea. Forget I said anything."
"It was a gift, sweetie. You know how it is when you make a difference..."
"It's a shame." The woman throws a pair of sunglasses back into the trash.
"Loo," she replies in a sing-song manner, as you take off your headphones.
"Never mind, that's not how you conversation people are supposed to talk."
"No, it's not *that* cool. And it's not a person, but rather a principle."
"No, they would just leave me alone again. That's how it is for everyone."
"No," he whispers, not even looking at you. "You want to make this right?"
"Oh hey, so you visited me! I'm very surprised to see you again, officer."
"Really?!" She raises her eyebrows. "Exactly. That's what most people do."
"Sure, friends, sure." He smiles, before the smile vanishes from his face.
"The fucking place is a magnet. And you've helped it attract the phasmid."
"The old man must have just hung around a bit. It's a ghost town, though."
"Uh... yeah, you were trying to keep them from murdering the rest of you."
"What is this, a joke to you? Why are you even *here* after you got shot?"
"Yeah, that's what Cuno said. No one goes in or out. Shit's paranoid now."
"You found him?" The lieutenant looks at the doll, then the man, then you.
"You had to see it. It had come to me through *psychic* means." (Proceed.)
"You're... like a... like a female worker's donkey, man. Don't let him..."
"You've done a great service to the community, to the RCM and to Revachol.
(Shake it with the tip of your finger.) "You mean *Col Desplazio*, right?"
(Turn to the big man.) "Well, he ain't been there for more than two days."
A sense of dread fills you as you look at the man with the leather jacket.
And you could take another look at the footprints, make your own judgment.
Another, more serious look, but this time the guy's not making fun of you.
Goddamnit, you're so small you can't even fit inside the tiny compartment.
He looks away, his hand moving on a keyboard. There's an echo in the room.
He's actually really good on this one. This is your gun, don't mess it up.
He's angry because his ex-wife is more important to him than he is to her.
I'm serious. I'm going to put the old fart in the oven and boil him alive.
It must have been a long time since you last ate something this delicious.
It's hard to say. This is a personal matter and I don't share it with you.
Maybe I should take some time to think about stuff then. (Close the book.)
Maybe this was one of the many ways in which he was trying to save face...
No one. Just silence. How could anyone be here if the house was abandoned?
Oh well, so much more, don't you know that I want *another*... (nervously)
Rent-a-cop? So that's what this is about. He doesn't want to talk to Cuno.
The black tape recorder lies on the ground with its tail between its legs.
The door is shut. It's less of a thrill and more of a *worrisome* feeling.
The lieutenant keeps his eyes trained on you, still unsure of what to say.
The man looks at you for a moment, searching for words, then turns to you.
The man says to himself: "Next, they come out and whack stuff down on us!"
The rest of the stinking cellulose is *much* better. Smells like fire too.
There's a trace of irony in his voice. Mischief. He's afraid of something.
There's no one at the fire engine who could say, unless they're *on duty*.
"About what time was all this happening, approx. 20 minutes after death?"
"But that's just it. The storm is far away. The tide is moving, you see."
"But who *are* the *victims? What are we supposed to do, *try* to solve?"
"For a second there you were not... handsome -- what did that look like?"
"He hooked one up to his motor carriage. And it was really, really good."
"I am the police. Have you asked me before if I had any other questions?"
"I did what I had to do," he realizes. "I don't need to do that anymore."
"I feel burned." (Look at your hands.) "Help me with this. I'm *scared*."
"I think the clothes were... you know, just there. To cover the laundry."
"I was just trying random doorbells, I didn't want to talk to the owner."
"I would *always* try to stay positive, but that's a hard habit to break.
"I would do that if I were you, detective. I would ask you to elaborate."
"I would never fuck my guys over like that." He squeaks with indignation.
"I wouldn't feel comfortable asking you anything else on that." (Corner.)
"I'm glad to see you here." The trip to the roof was a pretty smooth one.
"I'm not either one, I'm not." He smiles suddenly. "Fucker shit himself."
"I'm pretty sure he's a bad man. I can't get him to say anything good..."
"I'm sure you can find a tape player. It's not a very good radio player."
"I've come to regret the time I used to rely on your superior intellect."
"It's bad. Let's go." He puts his hands on his hips and looks at the sea.
"It's not something you should *do*, it's something you should *resist*."
"It's the prelude to the 'Radiator' of the future. A giant, black robot."
"Look, I just stumbled upon *another* dead body. This one's still alive."
"Man, that's some grisly detail. Oh well, here's to another case closed!"
"No, I don't want to give you any more money, officer. But I understand."
"No," the lieutenant looks at you. "You're not. Let's not get into this."
"Sorry, I don't know where I can find the representative for Wild Pines."
"The *uniform* he wore? I have no idea. I should find out. But before..."
"The bullet didn't pierce him, only tore him a little bit unconscious..."
"The old man was right. You were a *spook*, Harry. You were the *spook*."
"There are some.. mysterious *arenaing* things about the way he talks..."
"They should have let me into the harbour at once. I'm a police officer."
"They're not gonna call it a *pardon* if there wasn't anything to it... "
"This is *unnatural*, Cuno -- just a few of the many ways it's abnormal."
"Wait, so when I said I was a *cop* it magically made me become one too?"
"What happened?" She gets up. "What did you do? What did you *do* to me?"
"Yeah, it's got a lot of *gorging*. I'm not even sure I could handle it."
"Yeah, nothing big. It's not like we've really got anything to catch it."
He makes a fist, and looks at it as though it were cold. "What was that?"
He turns to you. "SHUT UP, CONDITION! You're getting a proper punishing."
He's long, brownish hair now -- split into two unsightly, silver strands.
I don't need to prove myself to you. I got that conviction baked into me.
Please, no. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't wanna be like that.
She could have easily changed her mind by now. This is a dangerous woman.
She smiles a lazy, half-sad smile. And then turns away from you, she's...
She smiles with evident irritation. Her cigarette has singed her fingers.
She's gone. The rain is wet and sticky. Her damp face rises to greet you.
The greatest motherhoods are the ones who are most *proud* of themselves.
The veins on his neck -- you see them *solid*. There's a *clarity* there.
The woman leans backward, her eyes resting on the footprints in the snow.
The wrecking ball is in your hand. You should throw it as far as you can.
There's no such thing as a *good* rum and no such thing as a *good* shot.
Wait, what? You were saying? How did she get inside!? Where did she hide?
You could follow up on that, but suspect you're not going to pry it open.
You see the beginnings of a sprout of leaves -- some yellow, some orange.
Your brain doesn't have time for this, your eyes are already on the girl.
"... and my little sarcastic throw away *sir*, like whenever I mess up."
"All right," she nods. "I am what we call a *bad ass*, don't you think?"
"But... I'm just a normal guy. I'm not going to tell anyone about this."
"Do you have a bottle of magnesium?" (Point at the bottle of Magnesium.)
"Got shot in the knee. Though you should still check yourself, officer."
"How can I forget your little side-project? I have a name for it now..."
"I can't believe I'm going to have to wade through all this shit again."
"I have a feeling this is not going to be the last time I've been here."
"I'm sorry for what happened, it was me... I made a mistake, I'm sorry."
"I'm sure you have the money -- and the means -- to survive without it."
"I've heard something about this place, but I can't really get there..."
"I've probably taken a lot of shit over my life. It was a great ride..."
"It's still early here. Faint daylight is seeping into the dining hall."
"Lieutenant Kitsuragi." (Pat her hands.) "I don't know why I'm like me."
"Of course, dear. Do you have any *current, pressing* medical problems?"
"Of course, of course, Harry. I'm not a real police officer. *You* are!"
"Okay, but..." A muffled voice from across the room. "Another question."
"Thanks for this. It certainly wasn't a waste of time for me." (End it.)
"The more you think about it -- this is probably a good place to start."
"The most wasteful expenditure here seems to be the ... velvet trouser."
"The surgeon's for you?" The lieutenant points at the man on the tripod.
"The world is silent at this time. So silent is the city, or the world."
"There's also the matter of the lieutenant himself being *still* alive."
"This is a working class place, Harry. We're all just trying to get by."
"We should call the library -- ask what's going on with these curtains."
"Yeah, he was a bonfire. Almost all of it. I can't remember everything."
"Yeah, I'm not. It's just that I've been going through some tough time."
"Yeah, you're right. Here's the deal -- we're looking for a *pig* here."
"You idiots have the future. Here. Don't fuck back at the god damn sea."
"You should be more careful, detective. Are you sure it wasn't a giant?"
"You're old. You've made it this far. Something has brought you through.
"You've already lost your identity. It's nothing to be concerned about."
(Swallow the blood and conclude.) "Let's get back to the Whirling, sir."
(Whisper over your shoulder.)  "I think I have a seizure in my sleep..."
As you turn to leave she puts a hand on your shoulder, she looks down...
Cool, right? Suddenly you have all sorts of cool reasons to look at her.
DINKY WINKY! You recognize this as the theme of *The Paliseum* by Mazov.
He does feel the urge now, but it doesn't matter. It's worth it for now.
He's not being sarcastic. He's actually proud of the fact that he can't.
It is a small thing, but it feels like there's something important here.
The man looks at you with pity and humor, but he's not sure what to say.
The man looks up, alarmed. "What are you talking about? I don't see it."
Things were going so well for him that he didn't even notice you coming.
You hear that, and the snorting sound, but you can't make out any words.
Your hands feel small and cold on the knife... nothing sharp like metal.
"Can't be." The lieutenant frowns. "But it is the best form of *that*."
"Do you know what happens when you leave a corpse lying in the street?"
"Don't..." she says, trying to wrap her mind around what you just said.
"I am sorry, comrades, but I am really not. This is just a daily walk."
"I don't need your help. I'm a cold-ass man with my own fucking money."
"I don't want to hear about that thing you *were* going to do with me."
"I have a feeling the international community does not approve of him."
"I have one for *you*. It was very important to me... I still have it."
"I hope you're not captain Sanders. I don't want you with my rag hold."
"I'm done imagining things. The reality situation is serious business."
"I'm glad to have a lead on my gun, but I don't know where to get one."
"I'm glad we're having this conversation. I'm getting so much closure."
"I'm going to tell the Union she's fired my partner. It won't be easy."
"I'm listening." The woman exhales and the silence is almost deafening.
"If you must." The lieutenant looks at the surrounding light and sighs.
"If your *vision beast* is helping me then I'm *all in*." (Accept task)
"It was interesting. I must admit, I was surprised you showed up here."
"It's *much* worse than that. I got fucked over by the fucking B-Team."
"It's a shame you can't see it right now. The bloom is still so young."
"It's the – you know the part about not being able to remember things."
"No no, you don't understand. *I* understand. *I* am a police officer."
"No, I mean *whom*?" He looks around. "Who's there? Who's still alive?"
"No, Kim! I totally missed it. I didn't mean to throw it like that...."
"No, you *should* not be allowed to. You're only helping someone else."
"Oh, yes. This is the *Falaise* of the south. The pines and the pines."
"Okay, we'll take that. And let me talk first -- about something else."
"Rappler!" The kid's voice is calling from the kitchen: "Raisin-pig..."
"Shit like that can turn a man into pacifist... Not me, but someone..."
"There is no incident. It was a perfectly normal, well-measured event."
"There's a giant ice bear fridge in the building's cellar. It's there."
"Well, of course." The lieutenant nods and turns toward the sunlit sea.
"What is this place?" He looks around -- all the way to the roundabout.
"What?" She looks up at you, the net tilted towards her light blue eye.
"Yes, I *will* tell you, the machine is a *totally* different beast..."
"You *didn't* have enough of them, though -- not enough pussy for you."
"You know, a past incarnation of myself called himself a *pissf****t*."
"You're right, ma'am. The only way to *know* is to *appear* to *know*."
A needle in a haystack. There are too many of them, it can't be opened.
Beneath the *boule* of civility, you sense a man who wants to be liked.
Degenerates? This is the latent type of communism he was talking about.
He looks to his left and to the door to his tent, then to the darkness.
He's trying to impress upon you that he'll *not* let you touch the gun.
I could use a beer. I could use a beer and a cigarette right about now.
Looks like they were a high-socioeconomic strung-out panicking asshole.
She really wanted to hear you say that, so she reverts you to the song.
That's the best they can muster against the assault on their authority?
The door to the Whirling-In-Rags seems to make a *little* more sense...
The lieutenant is genuinely worried about Titus. He doesn't know why...
This is the one. It belongs here. There is nothing more for it to *do*.
This is the same drug the lieutenant drank. It's also his *friend* now.
This is your floorplan -- the place where you'll be revved up for that.
You don't have to like him. It's up to you to get the *art* out of him.
"...was what you wanted to say? To others that it meant a lot to you."
"Ah... I guess that's over then. Alright, only questions." (Conclude.)
"And what is this, officer?" He's still lightly shaking from the cold.
"Cuno's been here before," he looks to the city. "What a time to die."
"Do you know who this person was, have I told you..." He turns to you.
"Easy, René, he's tryna' faze you." The blonde man looks to his right.
"I got it. Strong was not enough. All right -- we're on to something."
"I just don't know any better. Let's walk and hope something happens."
"I know what you're thinking. Why would I want to be a cop anyway?..."
"I was thinking: maybe it's real, and it's all part of the *resolve*?"
"I'm glad to hear that. I hope you're doing *great* work for the RCM."
"I'm just helping a friend. Cuno's built a business off of this shit."
"I'm not being sarcastic. I told you there's nothing to be scared of."
"I'm not going to play the fool. I'm going to call a *disco* station."
"I've had enough fun. Now, can I help you with your *other* question?"
"If they want to trade goods, they will come in on the Samaran isola."
"It's a part of the same team -- the same company, the same division."
"It's a shame the strike fizzled. You'd have gotten *more* out of me."
"Klaasje -- as in the suspect he let escape? From Kitsuragi's report?"
"My apologies, sir. I didn't mean to imply she was a drug trafficker."
"No, that's not why we're here. I just wanted to be a police officer."
"No..." The old lady meets your eyes. "He was a *bitch*, didn't he..."
"Please, just be aware that I'm still here. I'm not a *wet* any more."
"So you're saying it's not the phoenix, he's saying it's the *reeds*?"
"So you're saying you killed people, *after* active fighting stopped?"
"That's not really my area. I just want to get to the bottom of this."
"The *law* you mentioned would be the same law I'm currently under..."
"The Council's HQ is right here, is what anyone who works here knows."
"We? We're still in the same fucking district..." she shakes her head.
"What about what?" He cups his ear -- the wind blows. "What was that?"
"Yes," she nods. "But this building really needed a good *down-beat*."
"You know what? Fine. If I'm going to be a drunk, I'm going to drink."
"You're on the wrong track, officer. I'm just gonna leave it at that."
"You've got to respect the elderly. Protect their elders, especially."
A crumbling colossus, with fire and blood dripping down his shoulders.
A tiny, fragile piece of plastic, it fades into the murmur of the sea.
But what do you know? There are no cops -- that's not *what* she said.
It's... it's *not* a phasmid. It's not even organic. Just a fire iron.
Oh but he was *there*. Why was he there if you can't have an argument?
She is Tadeva, the daughter of Mazov, the founder of modern economics.
The lieutenant steps back and looks at the snowflakes fall on the sea.
The man starts laughing. "I can't believe you called the cops on him."
The scales of a dozen kilos of pure cocaine. That's how far it's gone.
There's a level of truth in his attitude. He's not trying to stop you.
There's less question about who she is -- they are after her, you see.
This is a *superstar* improvising. It's good, it's good. It's perfect.
Yes. I *should*. But you don't want to get in trouble with the police.
You have to give him credit for finding a way to handle the situation.
"... the way you know." (Tap on your head.) "And the way she speaks."
"About the not knowing that it was a *boule*... it's not a real gun."
"How old are you, pig? Three thousand? Four hundred and seventy four?
"I just hope I don't have to *seriously* obstruct the investigation."
"I mean, why not? It's not like we have to worry about a whole case."
"I was fucking drunk and I got shot. I was fucking drunk and I died."
"I'll be fucking covering it up with my sleeve in the morning, okay?"
"I'm sorry I can't be here for lunch. It's *so* long ago." (Conclude)
"It seems the next one took a wrong turn and fell over in the waves."
"No one's. It's you..." She adjusts her gown, still uncomfortably so.
"No, I don't care about your *rebellious* attitude. I can do my job."
"No, pétangue is for pansies. I prefer 'mainstream' police officers."
"Officer, would you mind?" The lieutenant looks at you inquisitively.
"Oh my god -- your authentication of the real Kim is off the charts."
"See you around!" the woman remarks, then has to fumble with her hat.
"Shut up, Shanky." The big guy turns his attention back to the table.
"Thank you for telling me. Even though I'm a full blown fascist now."
"That scars me a little, Harry. It'll look super bad. But damn it!!!"
"That's right. The RCM can only do so much. What can you do for now?"
"The autopsy report says it was a suicide. Looks like a dead man me."
"This here is just a test. We should investigate the machine itself."
"This is the most important thing I can do for the city of Revachol."
"This is what I do. I'm a policeman. I'm not some kind of a cop-man."
"We should ground the *owners* to make a little room for the rebels."
"We still owe you a total of 20 cents!" (Return the next five cents.)
"We're not going to the wrong place, detective," he says confidently.
"Well, I'm not here to entertain you. There are... *real* criminals."
"What about it? You think we have the murder weapon -- just for you?"
"When I resisted her advances, she just beat me down -- and left me."
"Why?" The lieutenant's eyes are on you. "Why would I need my gun, if
"Yes, I can't. I'm flattered, but I don't have anything to tell you."
"Yes. Like a mother who only wants to shield herself from the truth."
"You don't have to do it. It's a *free* thing. Just don't be a dick."
"You don't have to explain to me..." She seems to edge away from you.
"You know, the ones that are interesting -- on the surface.  Barely."
"You're a *paw* and a *crick* and it's always a *paw* and a *crick*!"
"You're right, lieutenant. I don't know what gets in the way of you."
*Ka-ching!* The padlock hits the wood like a knocker, with a *whirr*.
But he does *not* like that. If anything, he *likes* being in charge.
Cuno roars with laughter -- sounds like someone strangling a seagull.
He looks towards the sea. "I'm not going to call you a *lady*, Cuno."
He turns to the male. "You got any more *demeaning* questions, dick?"
It's not possible to truly understand a person until you've met them.
It's not the locals he's worried about -- but an eleven year old boy.
Little girl sees you coming. Living in the shadow of the school girl.
No way. You have his numbers, now what are you going to do with them?
She's getting the hang of it now -- she's not going to pass too fast.
Yes. You're pure. Unravaged by Narco-Mania. On some kind of island...
You *do* think that it's the girl next door? Maybe she's a bit older.
"Good point." He turns to his friend. "Then what is your next move?"
"He's not one of them. Or you." He looks around. "He's a  cyborg..."
"I can't wait to hear about the documentary -- it's gonna be great."
"I don't remember it, no. I *don't* remember anything about *this*."
"I just thought the most qualified man in the room could handle it."
"I see a song on a bulletin board, looking for a vending machine..."
"I should've heard it's a *she* in a *she*' s shirt. I'm a bad cop."
"I understand. It's the nature of the powerful to exploit the weak."
"I'm a police man. I need you to open the door that leads upstairs."
"I'm not going to try to lie. I just want to see if this is true..."
"I'm trying to be a *good* cop, but is it even possible to *do* so?"
"I've been merely accident free,'re you no longer in the main room?"
"Is it?" The girl squints at the window, looking up at the grey sky.
"It did not come up during our conversation about my ailing health."
"It occurred to me that we're doing our best to ignore the problem."
"It's... it's called a... Kineema. A metal-drenched motor carriage."
"Listen, I'm not going to say anything else. What's your real name?"
"No, I'm not." The man shakes his head. "What is this thing anyway?"
"Of course, you're saying this is all just a big conspiracy theory."
"Okay! Well then!" She turns to you, then leans back on her perch...
"Okay..." the man with the sunglasses says, his eyes looking at you.
"Really?" She savours the memory. "How how are you the police, huh?"
"Sure, maybe you want to try again -- let's go get some food, then."
"The entire operation was very professional. I'm not a *lady* myself
"This cracks me up, but am I... gonna give him the boot, detective?"
"We are -- both -- the Union of Moribund Alcoholics and the Moribund
"What are you, you?" (Point at the officers on your left and right.)
"What is there to say? This is what the fans have been waiting for."
"Yeah, Cuno's in a fucking gang. Cuno's in a fucking gang for life."
"You also have a problem with alcohol that you don't seem to treat?"
"You know, some of him *may* have been a figment of my imagination."
"You're right. We open the big one -- do you see controls anywhere?"
"You've changed your mind. You can't hide a cop. Now open the door."
He genuinely wants to see you cry -- he's so sorry and so powerless.
He has a *good friend*? That's what people were saying when he died?
His eyes grow cold suddenly. The lieutenant looks away, to the city.
His words remain indiscernible. No matter -- it's a beautiful story.
If you can't get out of my room, I don't wanna fight you. (Opt out.)
It would be a complete *fiasco* if you didn't know what a *pig* is."
She raises her eyes to the sky, slowly. "But we can do it, officer."
The entire Hjelmdall Quests are being used for some ungodly purpose.
The girl's face breaks into a wide smile of pure, unadulterated joy.
There are no *Coalition soldiers*. They don't exist. They're a myth.
They stand, facing the wall... It's impossible to discern any runes.
This is more like you're a little disappointed you didn't catch him.
You are the manly to the moon, here and now. It's your call to make.
You see the man from some kind of trailer? Could that have been him?
"Any "helper" would do this. XTO, in fact. In a previous life too."
"Aye, by the looks of you, you do. Well, we're here now." She nods.
"Believe me, Kim, I've *never* cheated on my wife with my partner."
"But you are going to be *welcomed* when I'm out here, aren't you?"
"Communism? Yeah, and together we make that piracy so, so *fun*..."
"Damn, you're starting to sound like a police officer, aren't you?"
"Everyone knows by now -- no one's ever going to find the phasmid."
"Good bye then. I'm not really interested in talking to strangers."
"I did it, Harry." He pushes on. "I pushed the local junkies to kis
"I don't believe the fat man's *real* sick -- just tell the truth."
"I guess you're right, there's no use crying over spilled ketchup."
"I hope not." He smiles. "I wouldn't want to add anything to that."
"I'm not sure I understand the importance of this." (Don't answer.)
"I'm not surprised. They're usually boring. Now, what was this do?"
"I'm sure. What else? I've done my research. I know what's normal."
"No doubt about it -- I haven't been in a car accident in my life."
"NO, NOT DOING THE PIG ON HIM -- I just WANT TO PROTECT YOUR KIDS."
"No. We can just keep talking -- it's nothing to be worried about."
"No. You are just one of them. You don't *really* understand them."
"Of course, we're all very sorry for your loss, ma'am." [Conclude.]
"Officer, is there anything else you can tell me about this *guy*?"
"PIG! You should *fuck* Cuno's head off because it's *your* style!"
"Tell me, what do you know about the assault that took place here?"
"The world?" She sounds surprised, as if surprised to be saying it.
"They're not gonna kill me, they're planning it to *disappear* me."
"This is exactly what I wanted. I just wanted to make a statement."
"We have only one theory. But it seems like an overwhelming one..."
"We need to put him in the sleeping bag so the rats don't eat him."
"What? What do you want? You're just gonna sit here and *fuck* up?"
"Why don't you get back to us? We'll know when we find a real cop."
"Yes, you are. Whoever you are, you should try to be one yourself."
"You can't get into the pub. That's not even in the club rules...''
"You don't have to make *them* cops -- only Cuno. Cuno's an asset."
"You found it when he was still alive. That's how he got up there."
"You know what? I don't need to talk about it. It's not important."
"You know what?" He looks at you. "You *do* have a case, remember?"
"You mean the Wild Pines representative again, right? That Torson?"
"You told me your husband's all right, now you want to discuss me?"
"You're talking like a *mysterious* detective. I know who you are."
He feels like he is the police, they don't treat him like he's not.
He nods, studying the door. "That's what he's calling you -- Cuno."
It's not easy to maintain, but I did it. I tore it up all the time.
Like a clockwork it clicks back into place. As if time had stopped.
Okay. Point taken. Let's see what Titus Hardie has to say about it.
She looks at the tablet of pale, not entirely convinced of herself.
She might be the one with the *biggest* fan in the group. Like her.
She shrugs. "Okay, damn. I'll take a look around while I're at it."
The lieutenant looks at you for a moment, then speaks: "Good luck."
The lieutenant looks at you. "You want to know what happened next?"
You got the wrong number, but everything's okay... here's the rest.
You must have a theory about the barn door that led to the balcony.
You've seen a picture of the woman, but you'll never know her face.
"A domestic violence victim? I'm not a domestic violence witness."
"A surveillance system for exterminating criminals on the street."
"And for my badge..." He points to the yellow badge in his pocket.
"And why would you help someone like that? By taking on a murder?"
"But what if we're wrong? What if I came back *two months early*?"
"Good." He nods. "I understand. I hope this clears up everything."
"Hello, I'm Amy, the head of the Commission on Human Rights here."
"Hmhm... One last thing, before we head towards dawn. SCP-3XXX-1."
"I can handle my liquor, Kim. What I can't handle is *capitalism*"
"I don't have to do anything any more. I was just talking to him."
"I guess I should tell the story of my friend Morell, who's gone."
"I like your initiative. You're the type of officer I want to be."
"I see, I guess you don't like cops or the law. That makes sense."
"I'm not going to help you solve this. With you." He turns to you.
"I'm not going to keep you waiting any longer, officer. Let's go."
"I'm not going to stand here and watch you fuck your own brother."
"I'm not so sure, but I'll try. Where did this *boule* come from?"
"I'm not sure you're really a detective. You don't look like one."
"I'm sorry, officer. I don't even know what you're talking about."
"I'm sorry. I'm not going to tell you how to do your job, though."
"I'm sure. We all are. She's been through some pretty hard times."
"I've been meaning to have a little run-around, what do you want?"
"I... uh... don't really know how to respond to that, lieutenant."
"No, it's your fault. You're most likely just whipped into a rut."
"Not being a scientist, I have no way of knowing what that means."
"Now you're being stupid, Cuno. Can't even get an idea. Fuck off!"
"Of course we do, and they're in the process of removing it, too."
"Oh, I'm looking for: Who is this person who was shot *recently*?"
"She's a hard-core party girl with a bigger death wish than mine."
"So -- where's the 12.12.12? How old does the world appear to be?"
"Starmie." He makes a sound. "Cuno's just blowing his brains out."
"Sure." he nods and turns to his partner. "What more do you need."
"That was strange. You lay here for hours, looking *luminescent*?"
"That's enough -- I need to return to work and the investigation."
"That's what I said to my personal assistant. She said... well..."
"This is just a way of saying that I'm ready to make a statement."
"This place is a mess... I can't even describe what a mess it is."
"Uh, I have no special interest in the occult. It's not my thing."
"What is that...?" He looks up at the ceiling. "We'll never know."
"What should I ask?" the lieutenant replies, rubbing his forehead.
"Yes, and I'm gonna *remember* my *old* life. It will be awesome."
"Yes, I suppose I was." He nods and then repeats: "Good thinking."
"Yes, it's you." He gives you a quick side-glance and turns to go.
"Yes. I see a little, but let's get going... the *bigest communist
"You don't have to go, it's okay. I'm sure you'll find some here."
"You don't have to make it *big*. The world is big enough for us."
"You don't need to stop now, though -- you can still look around."
"You're not. You're a fictional character. I know what I'm doing."
"You're right, P.I. I can't do that for you. You have to tell me."
Don't be a poppa. He's stupid. You're not gonna pull his head off.
If it were my body, I would rip the pants off and throw them away.
It's dark, mysterious, *dangerous*. There's something in the east.
It's not a very good song, but it's certainly an entertaining one.
No need to worry, the lieutenant is here to assist you in any way.
No, he's not any of them. He's a silhouette in a world of shadows.
She laughs. "I don't really appreciate that, thank you very much."
She's right. It's just a... jacket. You should be careful with it.
That doesn't *sound" anything like the rumour of *drugs*, does it?
The lieutenant is watching you. You're not telling him what to do.
The sunlight shines onto your skin, burning. Your hands feel cold.
"... said our organization principles in a sober, civilized way."
"Afraid of what? That tape the nosaphed was just that -- *this*."
"For a woman of the court, this is quite the award-winning idea."
"Good luck. That's not something a human being can live through."
"Good, I'll let my hand be the first one off the chopping block."
"How can you be a police officer if you're not even a detective?"
"I believe that's what *I* do. You can call me *I* or *I* do*..."
"I can't believe it... a fuck-up. I didn't know it was coming..."
"I can't believe you'd try to *snitch* on me. Who am I to judge."
"I don't have a problem with you, I just have *some* problems..."
"I mean... it's not like you don't have other people to talk to."
"I really can't say anything more about this. Let's do our part."
"I'm a big fan of this man, Red Astra!" He gives you a thumbs up.
"I'm not a feminist, I just wanted to see the look on your face."
"It was just a joke. I don't think it's the *right* thing to do."
"It's pretty much the same gang we've been talking about here..."
"It's very-very good. Makes you feel like a *goddamn* detective."
"Let's start with the foundation and work our way up from there."
"Maybe we don't have time for this kind of thing, in Martinaise."
"My partner is biochemically impressive -- but she's *square*..."
"No, no, it's a real joke. Cuno's got the hole already lined up."
"No. That's not me any more. I am the Cop of the Apocalypse now."
"Of course, Harry, we're happy to help you. What's on your mind?"
"Only the most *intelligent* of people. Grown-ups, smart people."
"She was out of town for a few days. They never got back to her."
"So you're telling me that you're a cop, not a beauty therapist?"
"So, I'm afraid it's going to have to be the other way around..."
"Somewhere in the jungle," she answers, her voice full of sorrow.
"That's it really." The lieutenant looks at you. "Let's do this."
"That's what I would do. I would *not* have to deal with that..."
"That's why I'm glad to be able to help with this investigation."
"The slack is just cadaverous. He's been decaying for a week now.
"They were on the roof. I did not get to them. They were *shot*."
"This is bad. *Bored* carabiners. Bad for keeping the bike safe."
"What about the other drugs? The *some* drugs? The *many* drugs?"
"What do you mean lost? I haven't lost my husband. He's with us."
"What" the man behind the counter says suddenly. "Are you alone?"
"Yes, but you were right. It didn't have anything to do with it."
"You can't call Cuno a f****t if you're not a big dick yourself."
"You did it -- because you're the suzerain's personal physician."
"You got me -- I think I'm going to get a bit of a heart attack."
"You're right, it's probably just good for my own mental health."
"You're right. I can't take it back. I'm not gonna let you down."
"You're right. I'm just a poor person, and you're a rich person."
A few more steps and you should be able to get out of this floor.
An old black leather jacket made famous by Filippe I of Semenine.
I'm already on the side of the fence, don't you dare to disagree.
It's like seeing a ghost, or thinking the body has left the room.
She doesn't know what this was all about, but she likes the idea.
She seems to be waiting for you to tell her what really happened.
She's not trying to start a war, but she's got something to hide.
The boy squints, eyes bugging out of his skull with excitement...
The clerk's sunglasses bounce off his glasses. He is unflappable.
The former cop looks at you, then the lieutenant, then you again.
The girl's eyes, large and round. A little girl is about to come.
The lieutenant looks like he's about to go *away*. But you can't…
The lieutenant looks over his shoulder, but doesn't say anything.
The man straightens his back. "It's a *mass murderer*, isn't it?"
The snow falls on the water, melting away without even a whisper.
The sound of the key turning still echoes in the yard, somehow...
"Cuno doesn't know what the fuck this, yo. He's just a pig now."
"I found a needle in a haystack. It's a needle in a haystack..."
"I'll just have the spirits and not the story today, thank you."
"I'm almost sure it's part of the cover-up. But just in case..."
"I'm not an expert in physical altercations. I know what I saw."
"I'm not gonna ask for this. Tell me how I'm supposed to *cop*."
"It's a great idea, detective -- you're about to catch a break."
"It's not the first one..." She hesitates. "You have your ways."
"Just make sure you *don't* say things in front of Miss Oranje."
"No, he didn't -- he was too young to be a delirious communist."
"No, I won't. I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm not gonna do it."
"No. I don't know -- no one's coming. I'm just looking at them."
"Of course." He nods. "Of course I'm in. We've been having fun."
"Oh, hello, I'm so embarrassed, this was... I might have dated."
"Okay. Well. My first thought was that she was insane, Jeannie."
"The drugs are part of the puzzle. What happened to the others."
"We should come back with the plan, no need for the legal shit."
"We're both cops. Who knows -- maybe a coincidence will happen."
"What?" The lieutenant notices. "You're in the other world, me!"
"Who were the people who sealed the room door after the murder?"
"Wish I could have been there. That is the greatest thing ever."
"Yes -- and the Wild Pines has cooperated with law enforcement."
"You know Roy's real name -- don't you know anything about him?"
(Nod solemnly.) "Yeah, I like it. Now tell me something else..."
A few grainy lines of data the lieutenant has already entered...
And that's it. This should be your *lucky* day, don't you worry.
Hang on, that phrase. You're awestruck by the nickelfe of walls.
He's not really lying, he just wants to get back to his story...
I think I've heard enough about this *fantastico* this one time.
Outside you see distant shapes in the hailstorm of the motorway.
She's sure they're just using the station for the sake of money.
Silence. She breathes an imposing amount of air. Almost nothing.
So the driver didn't have to have met you to commit the robbery.
The man keeps giggling as you begin to slide your fingers out...
The paper breaks into a thousand pieces, fluttering in the wind.
This is not something he's particularly proud of, but it's true.
This is your chance to show her the world of the cultured types.
Why are you even still typing like this? That just *woooooowes*.
Yeah, I do. But you should feel *huge* pride in yourself, too...
Yes, making music is fun. making *feelings for you* is worth it.
Yes. There's something here you should ask Herr von Gründigemar.
You just have to ask for one of those heart-shaped plastic cups.
"Are we in or are we *done*?" The lieutenant is looking around.
"As for this... I'm not exactly sure what you're doing here..."
"Goodbye. A long time ago." She looks out the window wistfully.
"Hold on, so you're just going to *talk* your way out of this?"
"I *know* I used to do it. There's something in my own dreams."
"I can't see the problem... I should just give up and go home."
"I don't know. Your husband was a different person altogether."
"I had to. For Mr. Claire. I'm a bad cop... So I had to do it."
"I mean, I get bomb shit. I'm a fucking bomb-throwing machine."
"I want to change the subject. I've had enough of this island."
"I'm not sure." He looks at the door. "I could *do* it, but..."
"I'm so sorry, hunch. I didn't mean to stick rude in a *gift*."
"I've seen you around, but I don't really know much about you."
"If I had a million dollars I would have my *eyes* on it, too."
"In any case, your report is complete. We should return to it."
"It doesn't look like you've found the culprit yet, but still."
"It just wasn't funny. *You're* funny, we're all good at it..."
"It's not like he *ran* it, though -- did I mention he ran it?"
"Just lay your hand on the body. You're going to need to do it.
"Let me guess, the 'whore dick' is already in a fucking lorry!"
"No! I told you to put that weapon away. It's a *thing* to me."
"No, but it is *really* cool I can control my own body, right?"
"Of course! I was trying to get that feeling, baby, I'm sorry."
"OH, I WANT TO DANCE WITH SOMEBODY!" (Start tapping your foot.)
"Okay, so you have no idea whatsoever where we're from, right?"
"PREVENT MISSILE, I TAKE PITY ON YOUR NEUROGENERATIVE DISEASE."
"So you're not an anti-socialist, you're an *anti-capitalist*."
"The five-year anniversary of the accident -- now in the past."
"To me, your husband is the most important thing in the world."
"We're here because you need help." The words echo in the room.
"We've been thorough. Do you have a plan for getting him down?"
"What are you talking about? Police business. What's going on?"
"Why are you not fucking shitting yourselves -- what's wrong?!"
"Would you describe him as being... a little *buffalo-headed*?"
"Yeaahh..." The man stops, his eyes half-seolite. "Definitely."
"You got to relax a bit, man. You're *probably* a gym teacher."
"You mean, there is an immortal geologist wandering the world?"
"You said it, right? You said it like a *real* police officer."
"You're right, lieutenant -- the society we live in is absurd."
"You're right. It's a really bad idea. Forget I said anything."
"You've had this on your person for *fifty years*, lieutenant?"
A sharp gasp escapes you as the lieutenant looks at the co-eds.
And it wasn't just the guns, either. You have to say something.
But you know they *want* to see you. You should challenge them.
Do the honours, lieutenant. There are so many to choose from...
Does this have anything to do with, like, being a *cow herder*?
Doesn't look like he knows a thing or two about figure skating.
He does not seem to have a particularly fondness for the union.
He jerks forward. "So what now? You probably shouldn't, but..."
If you ever feel like getting off this one -- your mind -- why?
It's no point making out specific colours, for obvious reasons.
Yes. He was in a bad way. From Korea. But not that way anymore.
You had your chance. He's a weakling. He's letting you know it.
You know it's gonna be like that. In all possible ways. Yeah...
"A little of everything," she says, feeling a little relieved.
"A look of happiness. His eyes seem happy, his face is happy."
"A lot of people out there appreciate a good disco breakdown."
"And I was *wrong* to trust him. How can I trust another man?"
"Are you into blood and murder?" The boy repeats his question.
"Booze is central to your lifestyle." (Point to your necktie.)
"C'mon, man, I'm not doing it for you -- I'm doing it for me."
"Don't we have someone else for the autopsy -- like a doctor?"
"Don't worry, man. If something comes up, I'll get it sorted."
"For a police officer, this is a rather... unorthodox choice."
"From the outside, I could see that *no one* was watching us."
"Fucking hell! I said *you* don't look like a police officer!"
"Ha -- so you *are* their finest -- and dearest to the money!"
"He doesn't give a shit." He shrugs. "Today was fucking shit."
"Hey, I just saw a name 'East Delta Pinball' on the doorbell."
"I hope you didn't lose your gun. I had it delivered to me..."
"I just found a bag of drugs, kid. Lawman's shit. Kid's shit."
"I think it's okay to drink. Just not as much as I'd like to."
"I think it's the merde russel -- not the merde I saw before."
"I would rather not talk about it. I'm just glad to be alive."
"I'll just keep the Cor-de-Leite in its hull, if that's okay."
"I'm no democrat, I just wanted to see the look on your face."
"It was my partner, I thought I could come clean." (Continue.)
"It's just regular murder-panic now. Murder-panic everywhere."
"Look, I just want to work! I want things to get *so* good..."
"No, what happened. They were shot by the fucking communists."
"Of course, mister. *Perfection* is just an overcomplication."
"Officer -- You're *not* a victim of the law. You're the law."
"Please, detective. Don't do anything that might set her off."
"So, is it?" She looks around in the room, fiddling her voice.
"The Cuno just can't imagine how embarrassed you are at this."
"This is all I have to say please tell me where we are, okay?"
"This was *all* a misunderstanding. I don't know what to say."
"Yeah, good point... Actually, I had other questions as well."
"Yeah, I have an opinion on this -- wanna hear it?" (Proceed.)
"Yes, you definitely have the proper attitude. What about it?"
"Yes, you. You should treat me like a... like a motherfucker."
"You need to *medicate*, Cuno. Medicate the hell out of this."
"You're right, you gotta keep the water in the pipes flowing."
Beneath them, you can see that she's waiting for your silence.
But his partner could have gotten in there. It's too late now.
He has to. If he doesn't, he's going to have to start working.
I can't carry you forever, Harry. But I will hold you for now.
No, no... your nose would *not* know the sign of the Pleiades.
Shut up and light that shit! You're a *goddamn* cop, remember?
The clock shows the time at 10:20. The hands seem to be still.
The girl stares at you with the sun still shining on her face.
The lieutenant nods, looking heartbroken, broken and bleeding.
This story of yours is another one of yours, one of *drunken*.
You can't put a finger on *one* thing. Only the one that fits.
You don't even see the hole in the wall, only the hole in him!
Your eyes well up with tears of happiness. You are in a great.
"*This* is what you call a... *strike*. An attempted *coup*."
"Actually, he told me he wouldn't mind the nightclub at all."
"Ah... the *first* part. You said *everything* is connected."
"But of course, I just want to be in a position to help you."
"Can you tell me more precisely what she's been telling you?"
"Cuno's gonna be on his own for a week, be riding the waves."
"Cut me some slack, officer. I'm just here to serve the law."
"Do you know what's up with the dust? The stuff around here?"
"Do you still have your salts? I feel like I've missed them."
"Goddamnit... you tell him Cuno's giving you the run-around."
"Good for suddenly finding a *couple* of coins in your belt."
"He just walks around on the beach, like a fucking skeleton."
"High time I got moving up the coast. Time to go undercover."
"I don't care, I don't need her assistance, I'm a detective."
"I don't know. But it's not Katarzine Alasije. Or Klaasje. Or
"I don't know..." He doesn't sound able to give a conclusion.
"I got a bag of amphetamine, can you tell me what to do now?"
"I guess I can't tell you anything more until I've seen one."
"I knew it..." She jerks forward. "Any shoe could bend it..."
"I know you're in there somewhere. Trying to sneak up on me."
"I'll try, friend." He takes a ten-note from a leather pouch.
"I'm not gonna do it. I can't be a cop. I can't be a writer."
"I'm pretty sure Harry told you his real name is *Germaine*."
"I'm sorry, detective. We need to talk about something else."
"I'm sorry, I don't actually have any good answers for this."
"Insane -- like -- like *cool* insane. What did he tell you?"
"It was not representative of *all* my thoughts or feelings."
"It's just a question of whether you're going to *solve* it."
"It's not a hobby, dear. You clearly need something from us."
"It's not easy to get the kids to forget what happened here."
"It's okay." He looks disappointed. "What's the use of this."
"No, Michael Vandermee, I'm only telling you the truth here."
"No, she didn't. She's not a person, she's a Mythic Witness."
"No." He turns to the lieutenant. "I'm not listening to you."
"Okay." The lieutenant nods. "I've also seen him. In the hall
"Oranje, it's not the first time they've tried to trick you."
"Shouldn't a working class woman be working in a restaurant?"
"Surely you do, my friend. Everything's going to be alright."
"The girl went upstairs and gave me a couple of *pisspipes*."
"The world spirit does not have a concept of personal space."
"Then it would be... *possibly* illegal, but that's the law."
"There's a massive ice bear fridge in the building's cellar."
"This isn't going to make anyone forget what they have Ahoy."
"We don't need to go in there... I don't have time for this."
"What's she like -- in your opinion -- around the community?"
"What?" The lieutenant jumps back, dazed. "What do you mean?"
"Who are you looking for?" the man in the brown hat asks you.
"Yes, but what if the link is unavailable for some reason..."
"You can't *dive* into the deep with me. It's too dangerous."
"You don't have to go to the aerodrome if you don't want to."
"You hanging out on the other side -- what's going on there?"
"You mean Revachol? No, it's going to have a different name."
"You see, Castutteringian City. It's kinda touched me too..."
"You're just gonna keep saying it's *hard core*, aren't you?"
"You're not going to *get* it. You're going to *lay* it off."
"You're right," she answers her companion. "I'm pretty busy."
"You're right. And I don't want to get into this shit again."
A bitter cringe. It *hurts*. You look straight into the dirt.
As he says it, his hands move to rub his legs and his thighs.
He thinks for a moment, then nods: "Sure. Good luck with it."
Her hands feel cold. She looks at you with a half-open mouth.
If you can see it clearly, this must be the one -- the one...
It's not a *real* heart attack. It's not a real heart attack.
It's only the second time you've ever seen him look that bad.
Maybe it isn't possible at this point, but -- I do trust you.
No, we can do! We'll do it without any problems! No problems!
Okay. Just looking at *the birds*. What about the *seagulls*?
She is glad to help, no? That seems reasonable. Who are *us*?
The lieutenant doesn't give a damn. He just looks at his gun.
The lieutenant looks away from the pipes, a little perplexed.
The lights are off again. The lights are off again. Have fun!
We couldn't have talked to you, you're not a regular officer.
Your fingers slip from the slimy pages, wet from the sea air.
"Ah, I don't know, maybe I'm a psychic? You should ask her."
"All right. Let's change the subject. Who *is* Dick Mullen?"
"Are there any more, officer? I have to start taking notes."
"Are you sure? There are things that are impossible, right?"
"But I *am* going to show you the right way to do your job."
"Cuno's going where the cadaver goes -- in the fucking sea."
"I can still see it's *definitely* connected to the case..."
"I can't smoke with my husband, it would be unprofessional."
"I don't *want* to do it. I just don't *want* to die in it."
"I found you your previous job. I asked you to do the same."
"I need help with something, Kim. What can I help you with?"
"I think your lost gun is the real reason for your failure."
"I would like to remember her as a kind and generous woman."
"I'm glad you're not psychic. Now let's go. From the south."
"I'm not going to sit here. Be reasonable and fair with me."
"Informal curiosity." He looks around. "What is this place?"
"It's not *bad* for you, though -- that's what's important."
"It's not that bad. What's the worst thing about being old?"
"No one's going to come, so the only question is -- who do?"
"No, I *don't* need this." He looks away. "Fuck this place."
"No, I meant something physical. I remembered we were here."
"No, I should not have taken a bath. The plughte is broken."
"No, it's not like that. This is the *one* you do the rest."
"No, she'd be confused. Ask her if you really want to know."
"No. Racism is the very last thing I will do in this world."
"Not you, you misunderstood me -- I don't behave like that."
"Sure, I'll do it," he blurts out, but then seems uncertain.
"That is not going to be part of my 'denizens of the deep'."
"The docks are empty, though I do have a boat in my hangar."
"Until it was their *passport*, the way his clothes were..."
"What about his *kind*? Or are we talking about our mother?"
"Yeah, Cuno sees where this is going. Cuno's in the ghetto."
"Yes, no." The lieutenant stops to think. "No doubt it was."
"You heard what I said! You need to get your shit together!"
A pity. The mystery of the Spooky Cop may finally be solved!
He smiles elegantly. "Such dependency only makes him worse."
He's a little embarrassed by the way he's holding the towel.
He's assuming a role to mock you. Assume for the sake of it.
Inspectorate General means internal affairs. What is this...
Out there, far above the sea. He's a bottomless pit of rage.
Self-destruction is *self-denying* and thus not *very* cool.
The greatest motherhood is to love your children as oneself.
The mail steams away in dreamland, like cobwebs on the wind.
The man looks around, shaking his hands. "I hope it's good."
The scab leader nods, appreciating the little thing you did.
The symbol is pretty simple: a cross. A super simple symbol.
The words come out sounding a tiny bit like you're a racist.
Think of it as an *antennae-style* alarm clock. In the wind.
"Did you hear that? Did you hear me sing? Did you like it?"
"For my trouble, you're only giving me ONE BREAK per hour."
"Good. They've failed." He nods. "Failure is 100% Control."
"Great; you blew us away. The reefs are exploding and all."
"Hello again, dear. So why did you need to make that call?"
"Hold on for a moment, I... have some *question* to ask..."
"I *dare* not. I have other pressing matters to attend to."
"I don't think he [sic] helped us, but he was *valueless*."
"I guess you do, after a few drinks." She nods approvingly.
"I guess you're right, dear. That's the cooler of the two."
"I still don't understand what you're doing in the church."
"I'm a bad woman, a nether creature of the forbidden deep."
"I'm gonna have to look into it, what do you want to know?"
"I'm not an augury. I told you I haven't seen the phasmid."
"I'm not really sure what you're trying to say, detective."
"I'm sorry. I'm just very excited to see you again, Harry."
"Is this the 'Aqua-Disco' club? The one you saw in Oranje?"
"It's actually quite difficult to get the jump on people --
"It's looking worse and worse." She shakes her head slowly.
"Man, who cares? It's a never-ending problem..." She sighs.
"Mr. Kitsuragi, would you mind?" His brother stares at him.
"No, we are *not*. The Union is a* law enforcement entity."
"Of course, I understand, I just didn't want to anger you."
"Of course. Yes. Because that's what the RCM is all about."
"Of course. Yes. No. I mean... what have you come up with?"
"Sad FM, huh?" She taps on the device. "What do you do now?
"Succcess! You've got the next killer on your belt, buddy."
"Talked, huh?" He squints. "I didn't know you smoked, Kim."
"That is what you are, the most *insane* cop in the world."
"There's no way of knowing. At this point..." She shudders.
"This is *my* racket." She smiles: "What can I do for you?"
"This is my new home -- a home I built with my bare hands."
"Titus, she's your real leader. This is a great sea-route."
"Uh... I'm on it, (unmute noise). You should *try* harder."
"We're not getting anywhere. You're just wasting our time."
"What is this thing anyway? It's a *crab man*, I tell you!"
"Yeah, Kim." The man shrugs. "What *exactly* did you want?"
"Yes, I am alive. I'm not dead, I'm still in the hospital."
"Yes, I heard that she's a woman, that's why I said woman."
"Yes, this religion of History is false. It has collapsed."
"Yes. I think maybe it's time for me to get out of this..."
"You're not gonna do that. It's not you I'm worried about."
"You're right, you're right." She looks around. "Let's go."
"You're right. That's how it is, you see. As it always is."
"Your personhood was never in doubt, officer. Moving on..."
A really good call there. This is way above your pay grade.
He shrugs and turns to you: "I am waiting for A to finish."
It has not been productive. I haven't done anything useful.
Keep sliding down the chair to peek at the dirt underneath.
So that's why she didn't want to tell me who was the owner.
The kid is obviously lying. He's not telling you the truth.
The radio falls silent, its frequency folded into the dust.
There's a startled gasp. "Oh no -- *only* the cigarette..."
Wait... are there any that we can do to help you right now?
What's behind the contradiction between your work and life?
You sense that there's something off about this building...
"*I* don't have a problem! I'm a *cop*. I *fix* problems!"
"Alright, okay. Now, why would I take it from these guys?"
"Fuck my *ass* and call me *Harry*. This isn't communism!"
"God, fuck..." The old man falls silent, sad and defeated.
"Good, good," the lieutenant nods, giving you a thumbs up.
"I am a person who does not care what other people think."
"I don't give a shit. This is stupid. Fuck this, officer."
"I don't know -- but you need to get him to the mainland."
"I know what you mean. What did the hanged man look like?"
"I really want us to buy that game I found on the island."
"I think we can just leave her like this. She'll be fine."
"I'm glad I can help you guys out, criminal road warrior."
"I'm not lying. What do you want from me? Don't even ask."
"I'm sorry, but my statement was what you're looking for."
"I've had worse." (Gaze at the bloodstains on the ground.)
"It's no wonder the lorrymen put their workers on strike."
"Maybe someone could find the book the owner was reading."
"No, thank you. Sorry about the whole *policework* thing."
"Oh my god, that's some wicked shit! I'm not gonna do it!"
"Oh, my god, I'm not going to look like a *f****t* again."
"Sounds like my face is melting just thinking about it..."
"Still, what were you doing in his apartment by yourself?"
"The herbs smell sour. You should go back and smell it..."
"This one's got a snack for you -- a cigarette. Boring..."
"We should ask that girl on the ice what's going on here."
"We should be able to come back to this." (Take the case.)
"What'ca fuckin' noddin' there, 'clard?! YOuija 'clard..."
"Why would I do that? I don't have a single thing to say."
"Why? What do you want from me? We took you in, remember?"
"Wishful thinking has no place in a police investigation."
"Yes, sweetie, we've already taken too much of your time."
"Yes, you put the mug in the trash. But, no, it's not me."
"You come back for me after everybody else has gone home."
"You're not mistaken. I *have* to take a break from this."
"You're right. I'm just going to keep on doing my *best*."
"You're wrong. The Commune of Revachol did not surrender."
An illuminating light catches your eye, making you squint.
He doesn't like this look, but he is not going to make it.
He looks away from the bike. "I don't know. I don't know."
Oh, right. This is an entirely *other-worldly* phenomenon.
She nods. "Mmm. It's what she wanted. She wanted to know."
The lieutenant looks away, trying to collect his thoughts.
The lieutenant looks down at his bomber jacket and shrugs.
These road signs have been put there by the motor company.
You're right. It's not a good idea to trust such a person.
"Ah, I see." The lieutenant looks down at his wristwatch.
"And you *are* a police officer," he says with a grimace.
"Boogie, Kim! It's the only way to escape the *sadness*."
"But what's going to happen to him in this *disco* shit?"
"Cuno's got some interesting tricks up his sleeve, Cuno."
"Foreign affairs, sir. I thank you for your cooperation."
"Good -- now that your *soul* is back, it's *that* again.
"I did not mean to rush you. You *are* a police officer."
"I didn't." She turns to you. "I'm sorry, I can't do it."
"I don't know, are you a social democrat or a communist?"
"I don't think you got that. You have your own *vision*."
"I think we can maybe get through this one without Anna."
"I'm glad I did. People like that *just* don't have any."
"I'm not really interested in *political theory* here..."
"I'm not sure I was really in the mood to play pétanque."
"It feels like a huge machete. It's a fucking monster..."
"It was a *Tequila* cop-man. I have no doubt about that."
"It wasn't *news*. It's a respectable business practice."
"It's definitely a place you can stay night after night."
"It's for the *honest* police officer. This is your job."
"Maybe." He nods. "We're working on it. It's what we do."
"No, I don't want to die. I have to *detect*. I'm a cop."
"No, I don't want to. I don't want to go to *your* dump."
"No, it's not." He looks around, then says: "What is it?"
"No, you don't. Just tell me where I can find the phone."
"Nothing doesn't turn a man into his grave, Mr. Du Bois."
"Oh, you mean like a brief? Do you want me to brief you?"
"Okay," the lieutenant agrees with a nod of satisfaction.
"Tell me about your friend, the one with the sunglasses."
"Thank you!" He extends his hand toward you. "Thank you!"
"Thank you, coppo. Thank you for turning my life around."
"That's no way to be a cop. Let's get on with our lives."
"That's right. And you're some kind of... *suspect* now?"
"There's definitely something going on in this building."
"We're all the same. Same eyes, same smiles, same death."
"We're in. We're doing this," she says over her shoulder.
"What do you do if you don't want to become a *lunatic*?"
"What?" The lieutenant rises his shoulders. "What is it?"
"Where are the *other* eyes? Is there another one there?"
"Why don't more women take them? Men can play this game."
"Wow. Now I get it. The RCM is such a nice organization."
"Yes. It's all part of the transaction we're conducting."
"Yes. Queer. Ascended. I'm an *endemic* bisexual myself."
"You're right. I have no idea what you're talking about."
"You're right. We're done here. Is this why you're here?"
A real nice guy, out of the jam -- and you can *feel* it.
A shadow moves across the horizon. From here to Revachol.
And the little boxes? The little boxes that say *BENIGN*.
He looks at the door for a moment, then nods as you have.
Isn't that what cops do, buddy? Smelling your own armpit?
It does not sound well. So what is he trying to say here?
It feels like the most important thing you've ever heard.
No, he's just curious. He doesn't *have* to. It's like...
She nods and returns the smile she so desperately craves.
The cook looks at you, trying to focus on the book stand.
The lieutenant just looks at him for a second, then nods.
The man stares from across the bay outside your window...
This is the first time he's revealed the truth about you.
Wow. That's awfully close to the edge you're looking for.
Yeah, good. We're getting somewhere. This is a done deal.
Yes -- that's an accurate description of the crime scene.
You could always do something like that in the meanwhile.
50% is about right. You should be more moderate still...
"Are you getting that? I can't hear what he's saying..."
"But the thing is..." Cuno seems to be skipping it here.
"He's right, dear Morell. Come now, we're losing him..."
"I did it for the Union. For the rights of the workers."
"I have my own place. It's called the Whirling-in-Rags."
"I know it's not the *worst* thing in the world, right?"
"I know what I have to do. I have to find *the Entity*."
"I know, of course. You've been reading books and shit."
"I like this. Puts the fear of god back in the f****ts."
"I need the help of a hands-on-feet specialist, please."
"I think I prefer cuprous tabernacle over pocket watch."
"I'm quite sure I'm a citizen -- of some other country."
"It's just that I found it and it's in my *inner* self."
"It's not my job to evaluate your methodology, officer."
"No one in Revachol West has any interest in the party."
"Nothing to totally bad on your experience, by the way."
"Of course, you're not a local, Harry. I'm not a local."
"That's a nice car. I like that. I hope it runs on gas."
"That's about right. And I'm glad to help you if I can."
"That's probably not the best use of your time, anyway."
"That's right. You have a very fine point there, Harry."
"This beer is decent, but nothing to get high over now."
"This is the place where *a lot* of people take a dump."
"This kinda shit is the kind you get when you're a cop."
"This looks as if the victim died from bullet to brain."
"What? You're giving me a shock? What's wrong with you?"
"Who do you think's running this little jewellery shop?"
"Who, what? The police? No, I don't know what you mean."
"Yeah, you better have something on the pump this time."
"Yes. And what was that about the church, anyway, Gust?"
"You lost a scalpel, right? Like you lost your skull..."
"You seem... a little worried there's someone in there."
"You're right, I got it wrong. It's a piece of garbage."
"You're right, it's horrible for the skin. Very ageing."
..."and he *came* just in time. It's been quite a hunt."
A woman in a ragged police uniform appears in your mind.
All you need to do now is read the next couple of pages.
Alright. Lecture the lieutenant for passing on the note.
He feels like he's been here before. Like everyone else.
It's not. The building is unreachable, the water is not.
Maybe we'll find a pair of handcuffs in my closet again.
She looks at you, her face pale and her shoulders stiff.
The corpse's tongue is hanging out... the net is closed.
Wait, there's a law against *exposing* people to danger?
What you want is *drugs*, prostitutes and a *hamburger*?
Why not? You know the formula -- the meat of the matter.
You haven't had a chance to read about the case at hand.
"A bit of *experience*. There's a little one in there."
"A little tango. What's the name of the weird martini?"
"And *it* is a thing to be ashamed of, to be in shame."
"Could the murder weapon we're looking for be similar?"
"Cuno's got this." (Give him the fixed hawthrone tree.)
"Fuckin' *Momma's fried chicken*, huh? Whatcha sayin'?"
"Have you noticed the way your body moves around here?"
"I apologize, I don't have any more questions for you."
"I hope you can stay. The harbour's on the other side."
"I knew it. You don't even look like an airship to me."
"I knew it." The lieutenant frowns, studying the photo.
"I know all about it. But I've never been *around* it."
"I really don't know. I'm not a *brain* doctor. But..."
"I should have killed myself. I'm so fucking pathetic."
"I think you have a *massive* mental health problem..."
"I uh..." He looks confused. "Yeah, I guess I could..."
"I'm a big fan of old military shit too, I like those."
"I'm glad to see you here." Her grip is tight and cold.
"I'm going to breakdown and cry and be sorry about it."
"I'm so glad to hear you're getting the message, Cuno."
"I'm sorry, I'm late. Can I get back to work tomorrow?"
"I'm sorry, officer." She doesn't appear to understand.
"I'm sure I've been in your apartment. I have a box..."
"I've heard you before. You're the voice on the phone."
"It was good. I enjoyed it. I did find it interesting."
"Lieutenant," he says, not seeing what's going on here.
"Maybe the victim refused to walk to his own lynching."
"Megatherion," nods the dicemaker, "a mega wild beast."
"No, I just want the car back." He sticks out his hand.
"No, I'm not, I just *needed* to get back to the game."
"No, it's not. I just have a vague recollection of it."
"Oh, no, tsarzys, no. I don't see anything that point."
"That is a shame. I would have made a great detective."
"That's right, Harry. It's still coming back around..."
"The corp. He's... a special ops guy. He's from R&F..."
"The dented yellow mailbox." He nods. "That's the one."
"The last of it, that is. Now, is there anything else?"
"They don't do that for me. I'm too old for the group."
"They're like the *people* he married. A long time ago.
"This is only a question. Tell me more about yourself."
"Well... this is your chance. You should make it work."
"What was her relationship with the hired mercenaries?"
"Why don't you just go and report it to the mausoleum?"
"Yeah, it's like... video rental. We rent videos here."
"Yes, you." He nods and leans back against the counter.
"You can't be a cop, Titus, not with all these *laws*."
"Your father used to go to that island too, didn't he?"
A small object lies on the floor. Shall we investigate?
An innocent man lost his life today. You have his back.
And just like that you've failed this little diversion.
Beneath the bravado, the nervous tension he's building.
Cuno's got no fucking idea, he's barely keeping up now.
He shouldn't have mentioned *anyone* with a broken arm.
He's probably just jealous that she's not Kylie Jenner.
His hands are covered in bruises and half-burned hands.
No, you're really doing this as part of a deal. Wait...
She nods. "Okay, almost. One more door -- the library."
There's nothing more to do now -- and yet still you do.
"An introvert," he says, unsure where this is leading.
"And I *don't* want to make this situation any worse."
"Beats me." She mutters, looking up into the darkness.
"Can you tell us more precisely what's going on here?"
"Cheers, big guy." He takes his glasses off for looks.
"Goddamn right I do! I am *always* gonna fuck you up."
"I am a gander and a hunter and a gatherer, like you."
"I am a member of the law. I take this job seriously."
"I am the police and I need you to comply." (Move on.)
"I don't know what that means. I'm just being *wise*."
"I dug it out myself. The gun." (Show it to the guys.)
"I just don't know any more... about anything really."
"I need the students to leave Martinaise immediately!"
"I never did understand why she'd be so forth-fucked."
"I should have killed myself. I'm so fucking tired..."
"I think that's what the patient's coming to tell us."
"I think this case requires you to learn one thing..."
"I want to go back to the completely different world."
"I'm sorry, Cuno. I'm not a good enough cop for Cuno."
"Is that why you want to turn the church into a club?"
"It has a different address in the heart of the city."
"It sounds pretty interesting. You'd have to tell me."
"It's going to have to be a *bit* of a miracle, Cuno."
"Look at me, I'm just a freak. I can't help anything."
"No one is telling me, I'm just a tool for the devil."
"No, I'm not really. I'm a salesman, not a policeman."
"No, you're not. You're not even Red River, you know?"
"She didn't do it. She didn't do anything. We did it."
"So you think she has information that will help you?"
"So, my partner tells me that you're here to *party*."
"That wasn't me. It was a female colleague. She quit."
"That's right!" He laughs. "What do you want to know?"
"The official name of the law is the *Iilmaraan Law.*"
"The way he speaks doesn't sound remotely like a cop."
"There have been some rather disturbing signs here..."
"We're cops. Everything is our fault, if we let it..."
"Well, what about it in the morning, around midnight?"
"What is this? I called your number," she says calmly.
"What's happening? I'm not trying to *drop* anything."
"What's your problem? There's no way I can do my job."
"Why not?" He looks at the large container before you.
"Wish I could. I'm just now getting to know you guys."
"Yeah, I don't know -- we're cops. We're hellraisers."
"Yeah, it was a real *motherfucker*... a real killer."
"Yes, and they've been moving containers up and down."
"Yes. It's the international organization for lawyers.
"You don't have to. He's not going to incriminate us."
"You got me, copman. I'm making it up to fuck with you
"You keep him the fuck out of this, don't you, piggo?"
"You mean there were *traffic accidents* on the road?"
"You said that the previous Union leader disappeared?"
"You're mistaken. I don't have clients, only friends."
"You're not an idiot, Harry. You're a cop of the law."
(Turn to Kim.) "It doesn't look like it belongs here."
A click. Sounds like the tie is talking him out of it.
A vendetta? Against the sea? This is important. Maybe.
He looks around. "What does Cuno want with his boots?"
He sighs -- "You see, I'm the loose cannon. You know?"
Now, this makes partying look *bad*, so don't do that.
Oh yeah, that shit's real. And real money. Real money.
That doesn't sound like it's gonna be very fun, is it?
The man stares at you, then glances over his shoulder.
The numbness is almost deafening after you've said it.
There is no way in the world your breathing is normal.
This has got to be the largest building in Martinaise.
You feel like you're peaking -- you better keep going.
You hear the water pump and the other pipes vibrating.
You're trying to run -- but your hands refuse to move.
"And you were in there, but you didn't say anything?"
"But I *told* you, what's this? We don't play fetch."
"But I don't want to *think*. I just want the money."
"For me it was *definitely* bad. I'm sorry for that."
"Hey, who wants to buy it? I want to make it my own."
"I am a criminal. I'm going to solve your *problem*!"
"I am sorry, sir, I just don't have the information."
"I didn't like the '07 Mug in the hellhole, did you?"
"I guess it's not really our job to figure that out."
"I have other business to take care of now." [Leave.]
"I have the right to use lethal force at any moment."
"I just had some *more* questions, I'm glad to help."
"I will admit, I am a bit curious about some things."
"I'd never heard anything this hard core in my life!"
"I'm gonna be a police officer for the next century."
"I'm here to talk about *Islamic theology* with you."
"I'm sorry." There's a pause. "I promise I'll do it."
"I'm too excited to die for some sadjunkie drug lab."
"If it's in a public place, then people will see it."
"It's a *baseball* uniform. It's a baseball uniform."
"It's impossible to say what your measurements were."
"It's just a shame I can't work with my best friend."
"It's okay. I'm just thinking out loud. Let's go on."
"Just a thought experiment. Let me know what I need."
"Let's go. There's nothing more to do here." [Leave.]
"Let's stop throwing around the *crazy* names, Cuno."
"Maybe pétangue players are kind of like each other?"
"No one's actually *seen* the phasmid, I assure you."
"Of course. Purge came in droves. That's what we do."
"Okay, I'll leave it. I don't want to talk about it."
"Perfect choice. Kid's gonna make it up his own ass."
"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Harrier Du Bois."
"Sure, whatever. I don't really care about the rest."
"Thank you for telling, officers -- I appreciate it."
"That's all I want to know. Who do you want to fuck?"
"This is not the *Aero-Titanium* you're looking for."
"This man is just a stereotype. No match for Gaston."
"Yeah, I'm over that..." She rubs her hands together.
"Yeah, that's the name of the club." He looks around.
"Yes, sorry about that, friend. Back to questions..."
"You said you were going to take me to the island..."
"You want to buy a *super-sledge*? You need a gun..."
"You're right, Kim. Anyway, do you want to see this?"
(Shake your head.) "No. I'm the new Measurehead now."
Another good time to mention that you're a *shy* guy.
Don't get off the cold leg, this is going to be hard.
Got stuck looking around and can't find the dead man.
He's still waiting for the fat man to stop screaming.
I don't know... just trying to become the right size?
I have a name and it's god damn Raphaël, what's this?
It's not *just* the pyrholidon that's causing this...
No. It's a *key*. A key you can use to open the door.
The man looks up at the sky, the air soft and gentle.
The two of you are having a falling out on the issue.
The young man shakes his head, smiling. "No, no, no."
This is your money, baby. This is your last chance...
What is the 'Page 1' of the Global Reference Library?
You can't disregard her. She's the cause of all evil.
You've found some common ground with this one. Now...
"And what, does it mean that I'm safe from failure?"
"Chief is the husband of it... the capital of it..."
"Did he kill the mercenary in a park, or something?"
"Honestly, it seems like *I* have been going under."
"How I could just... I didn't really look for that."
"I didn't do all that, man, I just want to go home."
"I fucking know what they sang..." He nods solemnly.
"I guess I just gotta use the radio some more then."
"I had to *live* with Sean -- which I won't forget."
"I have a drink to pour myself." She shuts her nose.
"I have a feeling some big shit is about to happen."
"I have spoken to the dead man, via the black wire."
"I haven't seen anyone this happy in a long time..."
"I know." She looks at you, her eyes soft and weary.
"I'll take the first one." He hands you the grenade.
"I'm a detective, I deduce that you... are... poor."
"I'm also very smart. You're a cop and I'm one too."
"I'm done with these silly things." (Mail the note.)
"I'm sorry it made you feel uncomfortable, officer."
"I'm sorry Lizzie didn't get to do what she wanted."
"I'm sorry, sir." She's blatantly flirting with you.
"Is that why you are the police, to police the sea?"
"It is a euphemism for the *Communism of the left»."
"It's a *snitch* thing ... and you're a cop, right?"
"It's a *tetris* board, is what it says on the box."
"It's just a standard flashlight, ma'am. Calm down."
"It's nothing. I'm just gonna walk back downstairs."
"It's settled, then. I'll watch you again." [Leave.]
"Just a short while." He cuts off a slice of salami.
"Let's look for some small children -- maybe *one*."
"Like one of those fucking no-it-out-of-sight guys."
"Machinist, machinist, my friend! I'm a *real* guy."
"No time for strategy. We need to get the hell out."
"No way. She made us *believe* she was the bad guy."
"No, Falang, he's dead. The commies won't make him."
"Oh yes, dear, please call me Klaasje or Katarzine."
"Oh, the *non-luminous* is, of course, the *light*."
"She was a girl. She was seventeen. Five years old."
"Something is off here... I'm not sure what to say."
"Tell me about the other guys. What's up with them?"
"That's a silly name. I don't even know what it is."
"That's no way to talk about an officer of the law."
"This has been informative, let's leave it at that."
"This man is going to wind up building a gas plant."
"Uhm... Sure," he nods, watching you shuffle around.
"We know who this is. Who *did* it? We'll find out."
"What does he want with this waterlock contraption?"
"What is that, a joke?" He looks very uncomfortable.
"What's wrong with being indebted to Evrart Claire?"
"When I fall I love too much, Kim. I love too much."
"Yes, of course. As I already said -- I'm a killer."
"You *do* agree the shot came from the roof, right?"
"You don't have to. He's a thief. People know that."
"You're calling because of the personal log, right?"
"You're right, you know. Politics is a silly place."
"You've been through some secret route shit, right?"
"Your line of sight isn't looking towards the door."
...you see yourself slipping, mumbling incoherently.
A small shock of happiness. He feels better already.
Don't say the things, I really need to talk to this.
He takes out his notebook and writes something down.
His voice sounds almost human in the way he says it.
She's checking her wrists, like she's used to doing.
The lieutenant leans in closer to inspect the boots.
The lieutenant turns his attention back to the door.
The little guy gets *you* on his back, he does that.
The silence is unbearable. A small flutter of wings.
This is the last one of them you'll ever get to see.
You see an old soldier's cap and a faded photograph.
You're a decent man, Harry. A decent police officer.
You're doing him a favour by being so open about it.
"And when you do, I will be in your debt, officer."
"Can you be so certain that you aren't selling it?"
"Good luck finding the list, I've already seen it."
"Hello, officer!" The cafeteria manager greets you.
"I can tell a story, but it's none of my business."
"I didn't know phasmid was so much of a *mystery*."
"I don't even care about what it *means* *to* you."
"I doubt that's the name of the station you're on."
"I guess I get to choose from among the good ones."
"I have a *crab* trapped in my neck, crawling...  "
"I'll be careful not to call it an *unusual* case."
"I'll be damned... when he's out of this, alright."
"I'm about to ask you for one of those *antiques*."
"I'm afraid your honesty is the last thing I need."
"I'm not *really* going to go into details here..."
"I'm not a racist. I stated: I am a neutral party."
"I'm not going to make a living. I'm going to die."
"I'm not joking, I'm not stuffing my face in this."
"I'm not your husband." (Look around suspiciously.)
"I'm seriously running out of shits to give, Cuno!"
"I'm sorry, I can't." She points to the little box.
"I'm sorry, I don't actually know what that means."
"I'm sorry, I don't know where to start with that."
"I'm twenty-something. I don't know how old it is."
"It *is* scary and dangerous," she says with a nod.
"It's a *little* difficult to understand, but yes."
"It's a bad habit. You ought to quit. This is bad."
"It's a good thing I don't work any more." [Leave.]
"It's a shame we can't get back to doing our jobs."
"It's not a power-crane, it's a transport conduit."
"It's not my job to know what's going on up there."
"It's... it's not important, actually. Never mind."
"No you don't. What the hell are you talking about?
"Not *that* cool. I just *do* shit. I'm that good."
"Odd. We haven't talked about that prostitute yet."
"Of course. And I don't even care about it either."
"Oh, but I *am* a science-priest. I'm a physicist."
"Or you might die of a heart failure. Or syphilis?"
"Racism is the sickness. Let's *not boogie* to it."
"Shit, I'm gonna get all of this into my head now!"
"Sorry, I can't just kick you in the fucking foot."
"The Doctor's gone, so he's yours. It's yours too."
"Well... What's more dangerous -- dying or living?"
"What was what?" There's silence. She looks at you.
"Yeah, people are always like, baby, baby, baby..."
"You already know that. Let's just get back to it."
"You didn't answer my question. You're too afraid."
"You know what, I don't really care about romance."
"You know what? I'm not really here to discuss it."
"You know, I'm getting second thoughts about this."
"You mean the - let's see what's in the container."
"You said you don't know anyone from *my* station."
"You want to tell me where you got that mask from?"
"You're right, of course. What use are footprints?"
"You're with the enemy, kid.." His voice screeches.
I don't quite understand what you're talking about.
I'm still not 100% clear! What am I supposed to do?
She's looking at you for a reaction, not making it.
The greatest motherhood is the purest in the world.
The lieutenant shakes his head. "Not on our watch."
Why do you keep this to yourself? Are you *stupid*?
You are not a *top* talent. You are a lower talent.
You're just delaying it. You're lying to yourself..
You're trying to force him to say something stupid.
"But I'm not going to be a *pissing* person here."
"Certain people are all too *cursed* to be found."
"Control your emotions, not your cerebral cortex."
"Did you *know* she didn't think about the place?"
"Do you think he's hiding something in the trees?"
"Don't know, I just walked right into the ambush."
"Don't waste your cartridge, little guy." [Leave.]
"Don't you mean... the thin yellow layer of dust?"
"Funny pretty face," the kid nods. "A total joke."
"Harder core means sexual. It's a *sexual* thing."
"He's wearing a revolutionary air brigade jacket."
"Heh..." Just a little. They're not that into him.
"Hey..." He stops and thinks. "What's that smell?"
"Hmm... do you have anything *better* to do here?"
"I bet you *did*, hobo. Do you know how it works?"
"I could just take down my gun and you'd fuck me?"
"I do, yes, but I only know what to *do* with it."
"I'm afraid we could all use some good publicity."
"I'm not drunk. I haven't started drinking again!"
"I'm not even looking at it. Just an observation."
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have reacted like that..."
"Is this yours?" (Show the figurines in his hand.)
"It's a good thing I haven't tried to murder him."
"Let's talk about the crazy dad-the-monkey thing."
"No, enough already. Let's get back to the music."
"No, I don't think they put anyone in the ground."
"No, you're not. Just lose what you already have."
"Of course, officer." She nods, her smile is cold.
"Oh, no-no, it's nothing... I'm just a drunk cop."
"Okay then... I'm not really sure how to respond."
"Pencils are used for drawing circles in the sky."
"Shaving is an international practice, is it not?"
"So you're not an actual part of the Hardie boys?"
"So, you think the whale is the only thing alive?"
"Thank you again. Let me ask one more question..."
"That's not a fun game to watch, that's for sure."
"The *whore*, who took it from you? I don't know."
"There's a fucking FOUR-TON MANTIS on the island."
"Wait, what happened to the people of Martinaise?"
"Wait, why are you even *here* after you got out?"
"What do you think I'm doing right now, Mr. Dros?"
"Why did you need to move out at such tender age?"
"Yeah, you look this way. Let's get back to work."
"You just saw a drunk guy get shot. What is that?"
"You're lucky we didn't turn the Cuno into a pig."
A single solitary speaker. Single *victim* of war.
Deep down you are a brave man. Show him who he is.
He's evidently still sorting out his mental state.
He's trying to call you a pig! Get the fatter one!
If your aim is weak, you still managed to hit her.
In his dazing state, the man looks down, frowning.
Is he sincere, or playing just some twisted words?
It's a pity she can't get out and explore herself.
It's got to be. This is going to be *the* biggest.
She coughs sharply, then whispers: "I don't know."
Sire, the only thing more to do for now. Please...
This man will never sleep again. Never wake again.
Why are you even trying? You'll never get it open!
Wow, more than 70! Is this even your first choice?
You have a feeling this may be an *idea* of yours.
You just keep on beating yourself -- go on, leave!
You need to come back, this is a *real* emergency.
You want to know how this reminds you of anything.
You're right. I don't know how else to explain it.
"...the mercenary tribunal." The lieutenant nods.
"And did you set up the shot booth in your tent?"
"And the head of the operation is in the morgue."
"And you're not having any fun doing it with us?"
"Another word..." He's still struggling to speak.
"Aye. Where did the dead body of your friend go?"
"But this is different -- I got what I deserved."
"Called me a slut, he says. "Called me a slut..."
"Cursed waste -- shall we say? But not this one."
"Didn't seem like you had fun doing it, officer."
"Do you think the police has lost its minds too?"
"Good for you, then. You are one impressive cop."
"He's a cop. He's a cop. I'm a cop," he explains.
"Hearing that name, you mean the assault victim?"
"Hey, I'm the one who got shot here, by the way."
"I drew a circle about a half a metre in radius."
"I feel like I can't tell you anything for sure."
"I found your buoy. It was empty. Just seawater."
"I got drunk and apparently drove it in the sea."
"I have a few more questions about the incident."
"I have to say, that's your look of the deceased.
"I just hope that none of this affects her work."
"I need to talk about something else with my son.
"I understand. You and I are about the same age."
"I was just trying to be tactful, okay?" She sigh
"I'm a police man. It's my job to ask questions."
"I'm getting to it. I already know the suspects."
"I'm not *sick*. There is nothing wrong with me."
"I'm sorry I couldn't help you, officer. Really."
"I'm sorry, I'm not privy to anything important."
"I've come to Martinaise investigating a murder."
"It looks like you like to hunt. Can't you tell?"
"It means the three of us got fucked over, okay?"
"It's nothing. I just don't know what I'm doing."
"Let's run out the clock. Lunch is at 14 anyway."
"Man, how did you have so many different skills?"
"No you're not. You're a cop, and you're a star."
"Not *too* much... I don't live here. I'm sorry."
"Officer, you are the angriest man in the world."
"Sane and dignified. Let everyone work together."
"Sure." He taps on his voicebox. "Hang in there."
"Thank you for telling me, Lieutenant Kitsuragi."
"The church will never turn into something good."
"The man has a serious case of *brain damage*..."
"Tits, f****ts, and bottes! I saw you a week ago,
"Yeah, Cuno's in a fucking gang. In a bang gang."
"Yeah, you don't have the bullets for the armor."
"Yeah. It's just an old fridge. I wrapped it up."
"Yes, I suppose that does make a little *sense*."
"Yes. The one and only way to stop this monster."
"You have taught me the meaning of wisdom, Cuno."
"You sure you don't need help getting to Gary's?"
"You're a cop, right? This is not a crime scene."
"You're welcome. We'll get back to our game now."
God... even this jolly giant? She's so beautiful.
Her eyes widened. "How...? How can you say that?"
It's a pity, the building has a great, bold name.
She continues to be *here* -- all because of you.
Stop pretending to be a *bad* cop. That's boring.
That's a worthy attitude. You must learn from it.
The man's eyes are closed. They're almost closed.
The message is clear: the chains are unbreakable.
The old man looks at you with obvious surprise...
What did she think was *awesome* about *Klaasje*?
Why, why did you think about it? Because of Cuno.
You have to admit, your raw nerve was impressive.
"Aaah!" (Turn to the lieutenant.) "What is this?
"Alright, this is your last chance to fuck off."
"And that's that. Keep your head down, officer."
"But I wanted to go back to the starting block."
"But there is doubt. Was he a *secret* courier?"
"Does that mean you have more questions for me?"
"Don't worry Kim. What could possibly go wrong?"
"Go easy, pig. You don't wanna fuck up again..."
"He's okay," the lieutenant replies, looking on.
"Hey... why am I even telling you these things?"
"Hmmm, this isn't really our area of expertise."
"Hold on, what happened to the motor carriage?!"
"I didn't mean to rush you. You *are* speeding."
"I don't care. I don't think the curse is real."
"I don't have time for this right now." [Leave.]
"I don't know why I do the things I do anymore."
"I don't know, officer," she mutters to herself.
"I don't know. I just know how to make it work."
"I don't see how it could have gone any better."
"I don't think I can ever tell you what I know."
"I have a feeling the lock will be broken soon."
"I hope I can convince you to change your mind."
"I need to know who you are, who you are *not*."
"I shot God, and I'll do it again if I have to."
"I still don't understand... what are we doing?"
"I would *not* give away the real story here..."
"I'll take it from here. Thank you." (Conclude.)
"I'm just an asshole, Cuno. What do you expect?"
"I'm not a liberal. I told you I'm a communist."
"I'm not a mass murderer. I'm a cop of the law."
"I'm not really interested in anything, though."
"I'm not really interested in that kinda thing."
"I'm not sure, detective. That's all I can say."
"I'm sorry. That's not the kind of thing we do."
"I'm still gathering information on your scarf."
"I'm sure not," she says quietly and looks away.
"I'm sure we've just got to wait for one night."
"It's ok, ma'am. Everything's gonna be alright."
"Keep it together, no need to show them around."
"Let's not forget about it. What happened next?"
"No, I didn't see him alive. I'm just a writer."
"No, I'm not. Don't say that. I'll get over it."
"No, she's not. She's a book store never-never."
"No, something's wrong. I don't have the money."
"No. We're having a *chick* issue. Not a man's."
"Of course, I mean no harm to the place anyway."
"Of course. He's going to wipe us all out then."
"So you don't even know what your real name is."
"So, from now on -- let's go to the night club?"
"So, is this a *strike* or an attempted *coup*?"
"That he's spiritual, that's his only weakness."
"That's a good, high-concept way of putting it."
"The Pox is completely wild now." I rub my neck.
"There's a... problem with the church, I think?"
"This is the Real Deal. I'm not going anywhere."
"Wait, so is Tequila Sunset an event or a name?"
"Wait... I think I'm actually a police officer."
"We're talking about *her* shirt and a *boule*."
"What if it's a *crab* man? A Crab with a head!"
"What was that about the bottle of amphetamine?"
"What's going to happen to the Hardie boys now?"
"What? Why do it?" he glances over his shoulder.
"What? You don't know anything about my bike..."
"Why did you need to get into everyone's trash?"
"Yeah, like that too, yes," he agrees. "A pity."
"Yes, but this is my police vehicle, I need it."
"Yes, you lost me there -- I have a concussion."
"You're right, let's talk about something else."
"You're right. That's not where the romance is."
"You've been *doing* it for a long time, right?"
"You've just said something *unintelligible*..."
A warm blanket of sorts, covering the dead body.
And the snow falls on the water, melting away...
Beneath the surface you feel the same way. Boule
He means it. He's giving you most *respect* now.
He nods. "Sure thing, officer. Seems advisable."
It's really nothing. I don't *need* it any more.
Nothing more to learn, just let the fight begin.
Oh I do! Hey, why am I telling you these things?
She's already on another boat. A different boat.
She's still at her post, smoking, doing her job.
That should make you feel better about yourself.
The kid is right. *The whole world* is watching.
The lieutenant gives the boy a look. "Let's go."
This is the only way you can get him to open it.
You -- a kid from Coppi, on the block... Alaska?
Your mind begins to spin on its own without you.
"And it's good to know your place in Mobilica."
"But... it could have been some *pig* drunk..."
"Do you know anything about the recent attack?"
"Don't be a dick," the kid says. "I knew it..."
"Hey, where's his *skeleton* in all this shit?"
"How many people have you sent to the *chaise*?
"I don't know what to say. This is dark stuff."
"I don't know... why are you?" He looks around.
"I don't know..." She's still searching for it.
"I don't really know. My memory is *unstable*."
"I got to talk to Evrart about the armour too."
"I have a murder to solve. And a body to bury."
"I must ask -- what does the cellar look like?"
"I want to play a video game you haven't seen."
"I'll find the means soon enough, fibercinder."
"I'm a cop, I should deduce that you're a cop."
"I'm going to the island  -- are you in?" (Go.)
"I'm not gonna let any of the other guys down."
"I'm only trying to be a responsible grown-up."
"I'm sorry, but we're all just doing our jobs."
"I'm sorry, I have to take that away from you."
"I've made my peace with it. Now -- what else?"
"If I may ask -- what are you *talking* about?"
"It is the symbol of Insulinde, the wild wind."
"It was a thing for me, I was a *disco* kid..."
"It's like you've gone *in* this damn thing..."
"Maybe the Wild Pines has help to offer, then."
"Mick has never been a fan of the RCM. At all."
"No one? There's something we're missing here."
"No, I'm sorry. I don't deserve it. I'm sorry."
"Of course, of course, of course..." She moans.
"Oh, don't worry, officer. I'll take the drop."
"Oh, it's you... You must be the worker idiot?"
"Perfect throw? Well... I still feel defeated."
"Reality? It's what you need to *internalize*."
"Right, sure. Who is your grandma, Mrs. Conze?"
"Sir, your hands are not what they used to be."
"So what if you have a problem with the Union?"
"That's right, but you're not doing very well."
"That's right. I know what it's like to be us."
"The guy said he was looking for a *solution*?"
"This isn't a church. This is a carnival ride!"
"Uh, what are you doing? We're a police force."
"What happened to the man with the sunglasses?"
"What makes you so sure Ruby *didn't* off him?"
"What the fuck are you talking about, Tequila?"
"What's a turn-of-the-century pub coffee shop?"
"Yeah, Cuno can see that. Cuno can smell that."
"You can get it for free with a little effort!"
"You don't look like other people around here."
"You know, you're not so bad after all, Harry."
"You're joking. That's not how you win a race."
"You're right, don't worry. I know everything."
"You're right, I should have sworn. I'm sorry."
"You're very clever and smart. Have fun, Cuno."
(Turn to Billie) "What should I do, right now?"
After a while, the old man spits on the ground.
Communism isn't all that dissimilar to piratry.
He does not reply, but his face is getting red.
He points to the door. "Fuckin' god damn door!"
He's like an organ. Or he was made by an organ.
He's right. You could ask him about that later.
I can try again, I've still got my eye on them.
If you can't trust her, then who can you trust?
It's not her, his friend. It's the world's end.
Just? I've been drenched in milk, I don't care.
Lizzie is not honestly that excited about this.
Look at the middle-aged man with his blue eyes.
No one needs to know -- let's keep it together.
No. You cannot *un-see* the face of this woman.
She does not let her guard down. It's too late.
She's right. She doesn't trust you. That's why.
Suddenly there's arch between you and the wall.
Sure, whatever, man. What's the big deal again?
The man in the photograph looks at you blankly.
The most important metaphor of the whole trial.
This might be the drive-in's computer terminal.
This sounds really bad, really bad, doesn't it?
Wait, there are so many things you could say...
Wouldn't it be, um.... inappropriate to linger?
You see light from the video rental's computer.
"*Why* do you think that I'm a mass murderer?"
"Actually, I wanna talk about something else."
"And what about the doors and the containers?"
"C'mon. There has to be a way to get by this."
"Couldn't you turn them the other way around?"
"Did you talk to the others, about *society*?"
"Do you actually know what you're accused of?"
"Do you know what's behind it? Do you have..."
"Do you think anyone has lived in Martinaise?"
"Great. I don't have anything else to do now."
"He said he *is* the one with the big brains."
"Hello again, gendarme..." He manages a smile.
"Hold on, why does it say *Whirling-In-Rags*?"
"I am not exactly sure what was on your mind."
"I am the police. Show me your police powers."
"I choose to believe in whatever feels right."
"I could be wrong, but this looks pretty bad."
"I do like disco, maybe I should get into it?"
"I guess that's a *simple* question, officer."
"I think he was just high, just like you are."
"I'd like to see you try in this bloody wind."
"I'm a police officer. I'm enforcing the law."
"I'm just making up our story as we go along."
"I'm not, officer." She turns to face the sea.
"I'm sorry, man. I'm not supposed to do this."
"I'm sorry. I just don't know how to, either."
"It's just a regular gun, what does it shoot?"
"It's not. I'm not a *brain* doctor. Don't..."
"May your words be incomprehensible, yes-man."
"No, you're definitely one for the long haul."
"Oh, you did, you saw the bullet. I remember."
"Oh..." She looks up, her face full of misery.
"Right. I am not a gardener, I'm a detective."
"So you're saying it's... a *culinary* thing?"
"So, whom do you think killed the hanged man?"
"That's all for now," the dicemaker concludes.
"The *fucked bitch?!', what's he going to say?
"This is a triage and we need to offer it up."
"We're not here to chat up the legal council."
"What about the other clues? What do you see?"
"What about?" The lieutenant has eyes on fire.
"What do you hope to accomplish by asking me?"
"What was I doing on the night of the murder?"
"Yeah, that seems like the right thing to do."
"Yeah, the lady driver was just fucking GONE!"
"Yeah. I don't trust you with the gun either."
"Yes, he meant *you* -- the Revachol Citizen."
"Yes, I was just wondering about the *disco*."
"Yes. I'm a detective with the 41st Precinct."
"You don't know that. You're not a *Titular*."
"You're from the 'Apricot Suzerainty,' right?"
"You're right. This experience was *not* fun."
"You're speaking my language, boy. Of course."
(Whisper over your shoulder.) "You okay, Kim?"
*Oh*, those ones! I do like those. Good stuff.
A little? This is really good. You're welcome.
Don't worry, the next one will be even bigger.
Have what? I haven't even done anything yet...
He's probably right. And you should thank him.
His hand falls into an awkward writing motion.
Serves them right. You can't trust that algae.
She's never gonna cry, least of all her lover.
The man looks at the door handle, then at you.
The woman is right. This is a *real* big deal.
Yes, that's definitely your father's  station.
You know who I am. I am the Fuck-In-The-Boots.
"A dance club? Like the one at The Paliseum?"
"Are... are you...? What are you looking at?"
"Aye, I had some questions for you, officer."
"Cannae you knew your name? What did you do?"
"Could you be the one who was taking a dump?"
"Do you know the names of the *mystery men*?"
"Goddamnit, we need to close the book store."
"He's a boiadeiro. He's a fucking boiadeiro."
"How do you know? You haven't even seen him!"
"I don't know who the... woman-hater... was."
"I don't really know what that means, but..."
"I say: 'Whooh, so it's *already* happening."
"I think... it may be connected to the case."
"I'm not actually an expert on police shows."
"I'm not afraid about being erased entirely."
"I'm sorry, but the deceased is dead anyway."
"I'm sorry, it's hard to have kids any more."
"I'm sorry, sir, I couldn't be of much help."
"I've grown accustomed to the *power*, miss."
"It's dangerous. It could leave us a corpse."
"Let's go back to the *drunk* one, shall we?"
"No, I'm not. I'm quite a *piss*head myself."
"No, not at all. How would a good cop speak?"
"No, we're not *at liberty* to discuss that."
"Okay." He's becoming more aroused with pain.
"Right...." He looks around. "Let's do this."
"That's just the way of the world, isn't it?"
"That's what you want, Kim? The *hard* part?"
"That's why she didn't! She'd never do that."
"There must be *some* more you can do there."
"This is all starting to sound very strange."
"Wait, you don't even know the body is hers?"
"We're not fucking coming anywhere, seolite!"
"We're pretty close to the finish line here."
"Well, I'm glad to oblige." She takes a drag.
"What about the other places you've been to?"
"Yeah, you guys are looking a piece of shit!"
"Yes, but that's not what you're doing here."
"Yes, I know. But what *are* you doing here?"
"Yes, I'm a *murderer* myself. A bad person."
"You got me, cop-man. I am a countersurgant."
"You kidding me? Why's the link still there?"
"You're here in Revachol West to keep order."
"You're joking, right? Why are you laughing?"
"You're right. There won't *be* a next time."
He could have bled white, since he's a robot.
His hand is shaking. A sudden, horrible fear.
I think it's time we faced our own mortality.
In the dark, you sense her eyelids trembling.
It did look like somebody had a heart attack.
Oops, I guess I wasn't quite sure about this.
She takes a long, hard drag of her cigarette.
The brief moment of silence is now a silence.
Well, all that fighting could be bad for you.
Who's going to help you if you lose everyone?
Yes. It's almost as if they were never there.
You are the law. You are the law of the land.
You close the book and turn it into your lap.
Your flare gets violent. The beast gets soft.
Your hands jump up to catch the falling snow.
"*I* am just wasting my time here, officer."
"At least the world seems to be still okay."
"Can't you turn them off and back on, Greg?"
"Do you need the assistance of a policeman?"
"First, you *told* her you saw the phasmid."
"Has anyone from my Station been to see me?"
"Hold on. What *is* a 'contact microphone'?"
"How many times?" She looks around. "Sixty."
"I am an alcoholic. I needed to get my hit."
"I did it for *myself* and not for the RCM."
"I have a question about Cuno's girlfriend."
"I have other questions about the lynching."
"I just need to get into the building. Now."
"I knew it! I told you he wouldn't have it."
"I should get back to my game now." [Leave.]
"I think I'm ready to run the R&D division."
"I think you're doing a great job, partner."
"I'm calling it: we have the murder weapon."
"I'm not even sure what my deal with it is."
"I'm not exactly sure but I *want* to know."
"I'm sorry, I can't do it. It's impossible."
"I'm sorry, sir, I don't know how to reply."
"It's better if you tell me about yourself."
"It's so nice to be able to finally forget."
"Just another dumb drunk idea, what's next?"
"Maybe. Anyway, you should go talk to them."
"No need for the jokes." She rolls her eyes.
"No, I don't think I've ever heard of this."
"No, it's not an honour to be a Pinnespian."
"No, not you, officer." She looks surprised.
"Of course," she says with a smile and nods.
"Of course. To me. Noid, give him the keys."
"Oh, you're not going to kill him, are you?"
"Okay -- why not. Let's change the subject."
"Okay, I admit it. I jumped to conclusions."
"She did not make the decision to kill him."
"So you can't imagine me *proud* like that?"
"So, you want to get into trouble for this?"
"Some day, I really hope I will remember..."
"Someone wrote him. Someone wrote his name."
"That's okay. Keep it to yourself." [Leave.]
"That's the one, yes." She flicks her wrist.
"The person who did the murder is dead too."
"This is the refrigerator I was told about."
"This isn't Revachol, this is *Martinaise*."
"We're not going to get anything right now."
"Well, you could say I got a little miffed."
"What about this conspiracy you're part of?"
"What do you mean, your *child* is missing?"
"What must be done, however... laboriously?"
"Why does this man need to be so hard core?"
"Yeah, Cuno's a fucking ant. Cuno's an pig."
"Yes. They're a big deal in the underworld."
"You got me. But what *are* you doing here?"
"You mean that old guy from the Débardeurs?"
"You mean the students from Soona's school?"
"You said you 'tell me'. What did you mean?"
"You're wrong. I don't have a vision beast."
A good time for a nap. If your mind is good.
A pity. She'll have to try harder next time.
And some that you have to *forcibly* remove.
Fuck yeah, you should get some of that shit.
HEAR MY BRAIN LAWLESSNESS FOR I AM NOT SORRY
Her eyes are brown and her face is speckled.
His eyes meet yours, then hers, then hers...
Is he trying to tell me his weapon is empty?
She may have. She's always been on the edge.
She tries to eye you. "Could be *bratan*..."
She's right, it's all about the big numbers.
The lieutenant squints, looking at the wall…
The lieutenant throws you a sideways glance.
There really isn't much the can do about it.
Yes, but you're just not that HEARTH RAYNED!
You don't have to be the butt of every joke.
You hear the water dripping from the bottle.
You've got a little more to say on this one.
"Astonishing quality! Unbelievable prices!"
"Did you just say you're going to kill me?"
"Do you have any other ideas for the mask?"
"Do you know anything about it, detective?"
"Do you know why he's wearing this jacket?"
"He really liked the feeling you gave him."
"How can I be sure you aren't lying to me?"
"I am a police officer, not your 'friend'."
"I am so relieved you recognize my vision."
"I can't wait to change out of these rags."
"I did not. I was just playing the game..."
"I didn't know I was a detective, officer."
"I don't know what, but it's not *enough*."
"I don't really know, I'm just an asshole."
"I just want to know that a lot of things."
"I know, Kim... But I wanted to make sure."
"I think I can share the information here."
"I told you -- you need to get signatures."
"I want to think my old classmate is dead."
"I'll ask Jim if he wants to play with me."
"I'll leave that for you to pick up later."
"I'm a police officer, I don't make cases."
"I'm getting up. They won't leave me here."
"I'm looking for a real man for that sign."
"I'm not sure if I wanted *to* *come back."
"I'm sure he's gonna pull his weight, man."
"I'm thinking of changing a lot of things."
"If I may ask -- what are the *residuals*?"
"If you're afraid, then I am also *drunk*."
"It's a motor carriage, not an airplane..."
"It's just -- you know -- Revacholian lit."
"It's nothing, really. It's just a statue."
"It's the symbol of the Secret Revolution."
"It's true. I've been collecting evidence."
"Just the truth. Is it true? I don't know."
"Let's see what makes you happy. Shall we?"
"Like a communard, or a rapper, or a poet."
"Maybe you're right. I'm a real detective."
"No, he meant something literal like that."
"No, he's not. What are you talking about?"
"No, I'm not. I'm not even from this city."
"No, it's *my* book. I'm a real detective."
"No, it's not that. The right thing to do."
"Of course, I mean, I hope I can help you."
"Right, I had other questions." (Conclude.)
"Sir, you need to put down that gun. Over."
"So you're not even gonna to look into it?"
"So... where's the next broken water lock?"
"That's just his way of saying he's sorry."
"That's... like... a really bad idea, man."
"The list of cryptids is not *that* short."
"The time has come to *connect* to RVD HQ."
"There was a bullet in his head. I did it."
"There's something I'm not *getting* here."
"This is the most recent thing I've heard."
"We police all over this city, lieutenant."
"What are we talking about? Cuno's gone..."
"What are you trying to achieve with this?"
"What do you expect from a police officer?"
"What do you think they did to this place?"
"What were you doing last Wednesday night?"
"What's next? This is an island, you know?"
"Yeah, *somesuch* shit -- Cuno's Cuno-ing."
"Yes, it's my cruiser. You want to run it?"
"Yes-yes. There's something going on here."
"Yes. I have no intention of repeating it."
"You can't be a cop, you don't have a gun."
"You don't need to. He's probably *disco*."
"You gave me a perfect name! I can use it."
"You haven't become a 'whore' of any kind."
"You know what, let's not talk about this."
"You'll *lose* if you don't do it on time."
"You're right. It's the right thing to do."
... but then you know that it's a bad idea.
A black ring of engine noise fills the air.
Contemplating the resilience she will need.
Do not say the words. Embrace the darkness.
He's about a hundred years into the future.
He's still not understanding what you mean.
It's the most important thing in the world.
Oh, but the suzerain's copotype is Omicron.
She's silent, holding on to her coffee mug.
Something stirs in you as he's about to go.
That's a bit *me*. She's got a point there.
The young man thinks. "Look at this boy..."
There's a sigh. He's shaking from the cold.
You should really *talk* to her about this.
"And you're a cop. What's your full name?"
"Can you tell me where to get cigarettes?"
"Do you know who this Dick Mullen guy is?"
"Fuck no, Cuno still doesn't give a shit."
"Gonna be fair, okay? Good old-fashioned."
"Hey, what do you want me to do, Tequila?"
"Hmm..." Something in her makes her smile.
"How did you get so cute all of a sudden?"
"I agree..." He just smiles at his friend.
"I do such things. I'm a bloody comedian."
"I haven't been *going* anywhere, though."
"I just wanted to ask you something else."
"I need your people to be safe from harm."
"I want to buy that mask off some of you."
"I'll leave you to it..." She takes a sip.
"I'm a police officer, not your 'friend'."
"I'm looking for a lot of stuff, ain't I?"
"I'm not a *funk* kid, I just like music."
"I'm not. My heart is in the right place."
"It's for important police business, sir."
"It's not impossible. I will prove it so."
"It's your partner, Lely. He disappeared."
"Maybe I was drunk, maybe I was asleep..."
"Miss, I recognize the 'Gaston' monogram."
"My man's not a gardener, I just said it."
"No idea. Did we miss the obvious here..."
"No, he didn't seem like a victim at all."
"No, lawman. We're solving a murder case."
"No, you don't have a way to describe it."
"No. I meant something literal like that."
"Okay. Let's get back to the murder case."
"So it wasn't *that* bad? Was *what* bad?"
"So what are you doing here -- in Tent F?"
"Something bad might happen if you don't."
"Tell me, what do you mean by *finished*?"
"There is something wrong with this door."
"We're going to do it, if we do anything."
"What can I do for you? Give me a moment."
"What is that, a word?" He looks confused.
"What makes you think she *is* hiding it?"
"What's so great about her wings, though?"
"Yeah, you're right. This life is a joke."
"Yes, Dora Ingerlund -- that's your name."
"Yes. Most people do. I was just curious."
"You got me. But what *is* an aerostatic?"
"You should make your money work for you."
"You should take care of that, don't you?"
"You're joking. Try not to shit yourself."
"You're mistaken -- that's just a jacket."
"You're right, I shouldn't call him that."
"You're right, lieutenant. What was that?"
Don't forget it -- the *important* things.
He does not know what to think about this.
He doesn't know what you're talking about.
Nothing else. Just the sound of the water.
Nothing. Just some KYGO-emitting goodness.
Shush! He's just trying to keep the peace.
That's very *sick* and *unhealthy* of you.
The old man does not answer. He just nods.
The woman remains unfazed by your outburst
Who knows what she's on about. She's back.
You can tell you're doing something right.
"Always a mystery. Always something new!"
"Aye, do you know the name of the table?"
"Cuno doesn't give two shits about that."
"Didn't you have any questions, officer?"
"Does he have any *friends* in the city?"
"Don't worry, man. We can figure it out."
"Garte, what if I don't want to do that?"
"Good call. Nobody likes a cop. Push on."
"I can't afford to be upbeat about that."
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"I don't know, that's what I'm thinking."
"I don't know. I just don't want to die."
"I have a feeling you're not getting it."
"I said it's not a game. It's a warm-up."
"I should have remembered I have this..."
"I'll do my best to get under her dress."
"I'll get you the information, remember?"
"I'm going to the island  -- are you in?"
"I'm not sure about the *velvet* gloves."
"I'm not sure I want to go out with you."
"I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to be here."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had to stop you."
"I've heard that you have a *hanging*..."
"I've seen you cry before. You're a kid."
"If it's not art, then what's the point?"
"It's just a bunch of containers, right?"
"It's not emotional, I'm just a law-man."
"Maybe it's part of a larger conspiracy?"
"Maybe we should get back to the murder?"
"My god... I've got so many questions..."
"No, I didn't mean that. I just meant..."
"No, no, no. That will totally be *sad*."
"No, no, no... you call me the crab man."
"No. I have found something more *real*."
"Oh my god, that's really old -- really?"
"Please connect me to the 46th precinct."
"Shit, Abigail... please don't call 'er."
"That's an odd thing to say to yourself."
"That's it. I'm off to find it." [Leave.]
"That's not really my area of expertise."
"That's not your place to live, officer."
"The end to this ride is the exit, Cuno."
"This case is what I will be *known* by!"
"This is a *leaky* drainpipe, you see..."
"Those are the lives I could have lived."
"Wait -- what happened to the other one?"
"We are *definitely* investigating here."
"What did you mean 'you're under', then?"
"What's the deal with Katarzine Alasije?"
"Yeah, dude, what the fuck is happening?"
"Yeah, the fuck do you need an army for?"
"Yeah. The same thing. So, what is this?"
"Yes! Thank you. That makes total sense."
"Yes. But that's just a small loose end."
"Yes. It's the Great Doorgunner Megamix."
"You mean the Wayfarer Act again, right?"
"You still haven't answered my question."
"You're no fun, Harry. You're some shit."
"You're right, I shouldn't have hit him."
"You're right. I'm not that kind of cop."
"You're right. I'm useless and horrible."
"Your first guess wasn't entirely off..."
(Nod.) "We need to talk more about this."
Detective Kim 'Pinball Machine' Kitsuragi
He does not reply, merely looks around...
It's not going to be easy break this guy.
It's precisely how *modern* his style is.
Kim's touch feels soothing on your chest.
My fingers reach deep inside the kitchen.
Mysterious tunnel under Don Andre's house
Nothing. Forget it. Go on with your life.
Q: What kind of a god do you think he is?
Smash in the place where it used to live.
Something about the tracks is familiar...
That's because you were so young, before.
The boy nods, then looks up into the sky.
The lieutenant glances at his wristwatch.
The shooting star still falls on the sand
The sink is deep, completely frozen even.
There's a moment's silence. Then he nods.
There's silence. There's a brief silence.
This is where the suspect started crying.
This man? You don't know what that means.
Translation: Fuck off, I'm more than you.
Why not? Isn't she getting *interesting*?
You cannot hear the arithmetics any more.
You should ask her about her criminology.
"A-ha, a-ha..." He coughs with laughter.
"And it's this one. It's quite special."
"And then you turned to him and said..."
"Good. We're fighting for a cause here."
"Hey, how about we *discover* this city?
"HEY, HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU PAYING ME?"
"I didn't mean to rush you, lieutenant."
"I don't know. I don't have my own gun."
"I don't know. I sleep. I'm very tired."
"I don't know..." She's still uncertain.
"I don't like the type of thing you do."
"I know all about the kind green ape..."
"I'd like to chat about something else."
"I'd like to talk about something else."
"I'll be right back, officer-in-charge!"
"I'll be with you in a moment, officer."
"I'll do it. I'm gonna get out of here."
"I'll see what I can do for you, ma'am."
"I'm no one, I'm just a police officer."
"I'm sorry." She puts her coffee mug on.
"It was... I think it was *very* close."
"It's not a metaphor. It's a statement."
"It's still pretty early for questions."
"Mhm..." He's waiting for you to finish.
"My point is, it's all about the money."
"No, I mean someone who's not here now."
"No, not *for*. Next time -- it's over."
"No, that's a *big* deal. Deal with it."
"Okay, okay..." He tries to calm himself
"She's not going to give you any clues."
"Shush, Kim, it makes you turn my head."
"Sweet, but... what are you doing here?"
"That's *still* not good. Don't-do-one."
"That's just a weird way of putting it."
"The main question is: What's going on?"
"TheLion of Damask -- with a long tail."
"We don't need to discuss this further."
"We're all so tired out here, sleeping."
"Well, I'm not really looking for that."
"What do you *think* is happening here?"
"What exactly is a *nobody* doing here?"
"What's on the other side, in the dark?"
"Yeah, sure -- it's just the way it is."
"Yeah, you had to let the manager down."
"Yes. It's part of the Jamrock shuffle."
"You got it. You're the next Tall Mans!"
"You seem like a really good detective."
...and just keep it real. Don't blow it.
Because it's dark. And empty. And tired.
He does not seem to know the difference.
He's right. It's a little *girly* thing.
I thought we had an officer, by the way.
Knowing he'll never be* able to do that.
No, it's not. I got this place together.
Nowhere! The name of the place is Rosie!
Right. Maybe the sky is still the limit.
She's not an idiot. She's just ignorant.
She's surprised at your non-recognition.
She's trying to get herself out of this.
The greatest motherhood we've ever seen.
The lieutenant does not have a response.
The lieutenant looks at you expectantly.
The man is about to go off the deep end.
This looks like IT'S THE GODDAMN POLICE.
What if we had a mental breakdown today?
You sleep on the ground among the reeds.
Your heart's racing. You don't know how.
Your partner should be here to help you.
"Any idea where you can find this man?"
"But, you see, they are also *spooky*."
"Grace..." she sighs. "But I lost her."
"How about we get back to the killing?"
"How did you know I'm with the police?"
"How does this curse... affect people?"
"I *am* right here! I was hiding here!"
"I also *can't* get into the building."
"I don't think I'm good enough, yet..."
"I have my gun, it's just easy enough."
"I just told you what a normal day is."
"I think I need to say one more thing."
"I'm hell-bent on continuing the case."
"I'm sorry, detective." She looks down.
"I'm sorry, I can't do this right now."
"I'm sorry, that came out wrong again."
"Interesting. Who's second in command?"
"It's for Dr. Morell. He's testing me."
"It's not so bad." The lieutenant nods.
"It's not." He nods. "Other questions."
"Lely's good enough for you, isn't he?"
"Mhm." He looks at it. "What about it?"
"No, he didn't. I found my own way in."
"No, I just wanted to take some notes."
"No, lawman, I'm not *going* anywhere."
"No, sorry, I don't know how I did it."
"Now let's go get the flashlight then."
"Oh dear. What a peculiar coincidence!"
"Oh, you mean the boy who was stabbed?"
"Okay, I guess I'll keep the die then."
"Okay, I'll let you work in peace now."
"Okay, this is bad. I'll cut the tape."
"Okay. This is going to be hard to do."
"Okay." Her voice seems more tired now.
"Please don't turn him into a fascist."
"She came last Friday. Left on Monday."
"That's *not* what I meant. I'm sorry."
"That's right, I'm trying to remember."
"This is the inital map of Martinaise."
"To my girlfriend. (Take it that way.)"
"What are you doing in the fucking LA?"
"What did you have against the police?"
"What do you *think* is going on here?"
"What do you mean you *lost* your gun?"
"What's going to happen to this place?"
"What's wrong with keyboard and mouse?"
"Why are you always so unprofessional?"
"Yeah, the fuck do you want from Cuno?"
"Yeah, the guy you were looking for..."
"Yes, I'm one of those *thing* people."
"You could try to get in there, right?"
"You don't have to tell me everything."
"You going to put a bullet in my head?"
"You got a problem with chink-f****ts?"
"You have no idea how bad I need this!"
"You mean Sir Moira, the Moira Bandit?"
"You're a fop, Harry. Now leave me be."
"You're not hearing me, lieutenant...."
"You're right, I was having a bad day."
"You're right, lieutenant -- I didn't."
"You're right. The law is unimportant."
(Whisper.) "What is up there above me?"
Don't be ridiculous. This is *nothing*.
Give it a minute. You'll be right here.
He nods. "We'll get there soon enough."
I think a lot of the time in this town.
I won't give you anything of substance.
I'm sorry. I want to say ... I'm sorry.
It's almost a matter of life and death.
Oh, no, no, Harry, this is a dead body!
She's not. She's not going to help you.
Smells like a hundred years of history.
The man's gone. He's never coming back.
There's no money in that man's pockets.
What did this have to do with the case?
Yes. You're going to have to do better.
You shouldn't say that. Not his face...
"Actually, no one wants to be around."
"Alright. Let's move on. What's next?"
"But you said you were *ignoring* me."
"Can you tell us where the tree lies?"
"Can't we go back and fill those out?"
"Do you want to know what's in there?"
"Good job then. Now what?" (Conclude.)
"I am sorry for your loss." (Conclude)
"I can see that." The lieutenant nods.
"I don't have time to feel good, Kim."
"I don't know what that means, Harry."
"I don't know, I'm just doing my job."
"I don't know, I'm not a philosopher."
"I need a drink. Can you pour me one?"
"I want to talk about something else."
"I was just doing my job, that's all."
"I was just joking. What's in a name?"
"I'm not really into politics myself."
"I'm not sure that's going to happen."
"I'm sorry -- did you miss that part?"
"I'm sorry, I don't know what it was."
"I've heard him in a number of forms."
"I've seen the winch, I'm not afraid."
"It's for an entirely different game."
"It's not going to be a pretty sight."
"It's not!" His eyes are full of fear.
"Lamby looks like he's falling apart."
"My god, why did it have to be *you*?"
"No, everything is just a word-dream."
"No, he means *before* he was hanged."
"No, I'm not. One of my friends is..."
"No, it's not. I'm just here to help."
"No, there's nothing wrong with that."
"No. I just remembered I had my back."
"Of course, Officer. No time to lose."
"Of course," she replies with a smile.
"So you're just going to wait here..."
"Sorry, I was thinking about *disco*."
"That's an old man who loves to swim."
"There are no *democratic demands*..."
"They would have to. For the harbour."
"This confusion should please Basile."
"We don't need to be in so much pain."
"We were talking about the *fight*..."
"We're not really talking about that."
"What did you say your last name was?"
"What do you get from him being dead?"
"Who knows... maybe it was a vampire?"
"Why did the dockworkers lynched you?"
"Why? This is an old, worn out thing."
"Yeah, this is the last straw for me."
"Yeah, you can't be a cop without me."
"Yes, that does indeed float my boat."
"Yes. But that's not the only reason."
"You may have the reference you need."
"You really should have worn a hat..."
"You think it's gonna be much longer?"
"You want to know where it came from?"
"You're busy. What time is the clock?"
"You're right, it's probably nothing."
"You're right. I think I'll stay put."
"You're right. I'm just doing my job."
"You're right. You're not too shabby."
Good luck, you thought you had it bad.
I don't know. I'm pretty sure I'm not.
No wonder you're not *wilfully* lying.
Noted. He's quite... in tune with you.
Samples of alcohol and broken bottles.
Shake off the daze. [Discard thought.]
She nods, her voice surprisingly calm.
The lieutenant nods, as you take them.
This is not going to end well for you.
What are you planning on doing, Harry?
You have to. The corpse is still cold.
You should check yourself for a pulse.
"... to spend time with his partner."
"A random shot fired by a drunk guy."
"Alright, let's look at the picture."
"Do I look like a friend of the law?"
"Do you know where it's coming from?"
"Fuck it, I can't talk to her again."
"Fuck yeah, *you* do! I'm listening."
"Fuck, what's going to happen to me?"
"Gawd, man. I need to wait around..."
"Have you looked into the *phasmid*?"
"He's wearing a Tracksuit Underwear."
"Hey, Kevin. It's the Gleam Butcher."
"Hold on there. I don't have a name."
"I may be insane, but... I love you."
"I need to ask about something else."
"I need to get back to the Whirling."
"I think I have a crack in the case."
"I think I've come up with a name..."
"I think the *victim* is still here."
"I'm afraid that you can't, officer."
"I'm definitely not someone who holds
"I'm feeling pretty good about this."
"I'm guessing I can't see your face."
"I'm not a fan of your little games."
"I'm not a witch, I don't do spells."
"I'm not even sure what swimwear is."
"I'm not sure how I feel about *it*."
"I'm not sure how I feel about this."
"I'm okay. I don't know what to say."
"I'm so fucking sorry, snake petals."
"I'm sure it's worth it." (Conclude.)
"I... I didn't know it was even true.
"I... I don't know. I just found it."
"It's not like I'm *prouder* of you."
"It's the helmet. I think I like it."
"Kim, what's the *bang* in your eye?"
"Maybe I have a vendetta against it?"
"No offence. I can work with anyone."
"Of course." Her expression stiffens.
"Oh, alright then. Another question."
"Oh, no, we're not doing that again."
"Okay, Cuno's got this. Parthonosis."
"Seriously, why are you pressing it?"
"So, what exactly have I been doing?"
"Sounds like you're being sarcastic."
"Thanks, Cindy." (Pick up the brush.)
"That's a... you have a point there."
"The one with the horns on the coat."
"There's nothing to do about it now."
"There's something I'd like to sell."
"This is a waste of everyone's time."
"Wait, what kind of *music* is that?"
"We can -- but that's a stupid idea."
"We don't know what we've found yet."
"We need to talk about your husband."
"We were just talking about a death."
"We'll see. I wouldn't get involved."
"We're not supposed to say anything."
"What am I doing with a guy like me?"
"What kind of *disco* music is that?"
"What was our last call?" (Conclude.)
"What was that about the other wall?"
"Who's this Miss Beaufort, actually?"
"Why are you so fucking FAT, Kenny?!"
"Why do you always have to say that?"
"Why? That's what you're living for!"
"Yes, it's a *bratan* and a *pig*..."
"Yes, that's the moral of the story."
"Yes. But for him that number is 56."
"You don't seem to like them at all."
"You will see, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
"You're right, it's not a good idea."
He knows *and* the lieutenant's gone.
No, I'm not. I'm not a *drug addict*.
Only lovers survive police brutality.
She shrugs. "Lizzie needed some air."
Sounds like half the wall is missing.
The lieutenant nods. "Too dangerous."
There's something in there? A secret?
What in god's name is she doing this?
YES, A FEWERLESS TASK OF INFERIORITY.
"A baggie... but like in this vial."
"A very, very sad, melancholy tune."
"Aal-Sahrava, 52° centigrade, hail."
"And you saw through her? So did I."
"Aye, Cuno... would you like me to."
"Do you want to help the RCM again?"
"Good. It was late. And she's gone."
"Hey, what's that noise down there?"
"I am not the police. I am the law!"
"I am, yes. You have a point there."
"I have an actual question for you."
"I have no idea how to answer that."
"I think I see where this is going."
"I think you've got the right idea."
"I want to ask you a few questions."
"I will look into it. Tell me more."
"I will take care of this." [Leave.]
"I'm afraid I can't do it any more."
"I'm begging you, what is the pale?"
"I'm glad to see you here, officer."
"It's pretty silent on this island."
"It's us being undisciplined, Cuno."
"Jim, I think he's trying to say..."
"No, there's nothing on the island."
"Oh, so *now* I'm a real detective?"
"Oh, so I'm *now* a real detective?"
"Oh, so I'm now a *real* detective?"
"Oh, so now I'm a *real* detective?"
"Oh, they are. So, so professional."
"Okay, let's leave it at that then."
"Please, detective, not this again."
"Someone's got to do some cleaning."
"That's it, I need to do some work."
"This is normal. We don't complain."
"This is the police. Show yourself."
"Wait, what should I *do* with him?"
"Wait, who's the Mother of Silence?"
"We could undress there... do that."
"We should get back to the lab now."
"What do we have here, a *mystery*?"
"What does the internet do for you?"
"What if more people were murdered?"
"What makes you think she has more?"
"What was there that surprised you?"
"Why didn't you tell me you saw it?"
"Yeah, the case seems kind of done."
"Yes, almighty Revachol, of course!"
"Yes. I *am* an appreciative giver."
"Yes. I was sent by the communards."
"You guys are just like you: crazy."
"You look like you're not doing it."
"You said it, Harry! You said that!"
"You shut your mouth and take this."
"You're mine, Harry. Nobody else's."
A little kiss, just between friends.
But this shit's too sweet to handle.
Cuno's finger is on the *high five*.
Don't get melodramatic. Just listen.
Feels like someone's angry left leg.
He probably thought it a funny joke.
High enough to say: I'll be in hell!
It feels a gush of wind through you.
Let it go. (Look at the snow again.)
Love through the wires. Love prison.
Maybe this is what the old man said?
Maybe you can't spell it, are you...
Something's blocking the sun's rays.
That's not what he means. I mean it.
The man on the photo does not reply.
Yes. You're almost certainly insane.
You feel you're *way* above average.
You have a feeling the big guy is...
You: "I'm gonna make it count, pal."
"*Stay* is not the same as *kill*?"
"A-ha, so you've been listening..."
"Are you living with your parents?"
"Aye. This is no place for liquor."
"Cool. That's well done. Good job."
"Cuno's the hard core of the club."
"For almighty Revachol, of course!"
"Fuck you, you're just an asshole."
"I can see you're joking, officer."
"I don't know what to say to that."
"I don't like it. It's unpleasant."
"I have a key, I don't need it...."
"I have other questions, actually."
"I have some loose ends to tie up."
"I know what I saw. It was *real*."
"I see. That's just the way it is."
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to rush."
"If only their glass was broken..."
"It's a matter of days, not weeks."
"It's not *unreal*... It's normal."
"It's okay. I'm just doing my job."
"Look at you, you can barely walk."
"Look, he's trying to communicate."
"Maybe the fingerprints are yours?"
"No, I meant the physical reality."
"No, I'm not. I'm just a fall guy."
"No, it's not. That's just stupid."
"No, not you. You're just like me."
"Not really. I just play my guitar.
"Okay, I'll let you work." [Leave.]
"Okay, what *are* you looking for?"
"Perhaps the authorities can help?"
"Raise that glass and kiss my ass!"
"Sanders? Sanders lost his badge?!"
"Shut up and light that shit, Lee."
"So you're saying it's *my* fault?"
"Thanks for your help." (Conclude.)
"To fuck with the head of the RCM."
"Wait, what's happening to my gun?"
"What are you *really* doing here?"
"What does a Bullet for the Union?"
"What was the nature of the curse?"
"What's the deal with the phasmid?"
"What's the reason for the murder?"
"Who really knows what that means?"
"With that, the experiment ends..."
"Yes. Drugs make you invulnerable."
"You don't have to turn into that."
"You don't seem to like them much."
"You ever been inside the chimney?"
"You're right. I'm sorry I'm late."
"You're right. What's the trouble?"
(Whisper) "Kim... help me get out."
(Whisper.) "One more door, please."
A familiar ring. Cold and familiar.
Doesn't seem like he's enjoying it.
Girls are square, boys are circles.
God... there's hope, a little hope.
He feels like some sort of *giant*.
Her eyes meet yours. She's hopeful.
I don't want to give you any money!
Not right away. That was a mistake.
Oh god. With tongues -- it *hurts*.
She's never been on the other side.
The lieutenant is still shuddering.
The lieutenant raises his eyebrows.
The man certainly knew his style...
The man just looks at you and nods.
There is no answer, no one is home.
There's a lot of that stuff in him.
This is it. He's starting to laugh.
You should just take what she says.
"Cuno, I want to get back to you."
"Got it. That's all that matters."
"His car... well, it's a *cargo*."
"Huh, this has happened before..."
"I can tell, because it's broken."
"I don't know. I'm not persuaded."
"I guess I am, but I'll continue."
"I hope you do. I hope it's good."
"I know I'm not good for nothing."
"I think you made a wrong choice."
"I wanted to talk to the manager."
"I'll answer your question, then."
"I'll leave you to it..." [Leave.]
"I'm blowing this case wide open."
"I'm not. I'm not doing anything."
"I'm still trying to get into it."
"Is the lieutenant a fucking cop?"
"It has just too much technology."
"It wasn't me. It was the dweorg."
"It's not very convincing, is it?"
"Let's leave it?" She weakly adds.
"Listen, man, I'm not *stupid* but
"No, I didn't get it. You didn't."
"No, it's not cool. Fuck the hat."
"Nothing. Couldn't find anything."
"So what do you really want then?"
"So which one is it, who's right?"
"Sorry, Cuno, I'm a little tired."
"Sure, why not? It's a good song."
"That doesn't sound like a lot..."
"That's my *best friend*, piggoo!"
"The 'Cuno pleases the Cuno' cop."
"Thinking of making some *money*."
"We'll do this by the book, okay?"
"What did you *do* to this woman?"
"What do you know about the case?"
"What do you mean, 'you'll pass'?"
"What do you think? You're right."
"What exactly is the Condor case?"
"What if I don't want to do that?"
"What's he on about -- liability?"
"What's with *the* big *lilique*?"
"What? No. None of your business."
"When karaoke is all done, is it?"
"Why not...? We could just go on."
"Wild, your friend, the gardener!"
"Yeah? You should shoot yourself."
"Yes, I think we got that." (Nod.)
"Yes, well. Eventually. Anyway..."
"You don't want to get into this?"
"You know what you're doing here."
"You know, I get hurt. I'm a guy."
"You're *sure* I'm being handled."
"You're right. I'm not. But I do."
Don't say that. I didn't say that.
Hah! Maybe you were being *drunk*.
He's a bit of a masochist himself.
He's going to tell you everything.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
I don't wanna call it *the dance*.
It didn't evolve into a folk game.
It's still fairly bad, she thinks.
That's right. You're always wrong.
That's very unprofessional of you.
The young woman has left the room.
VERY VIOLENT ROLE PLAYING COPOTYPE
You could have your feet very bad.
You'll just have to keep guessing.
"...or, actually be a communist!"
"Aye, they're good. I like them."
"But what if I *have* the money?"
"C'mon, what do you mean *lost*?"
"Damn, I don't know what it was."
"Do *not* *squeak* the doorbell?"
"Fuck it, what has it come to..."
"Hold on, which one do you mean?"
"How do you respond to an order?"
"I did it, Kim! I took the shot!"
"I don't know why you'd ask him."
"I guess it's good you're sorry."
"I have brought you some relief."
"I just know I'm in great shape."
"I know she's a mother of *two*."
"I want to buy those some Jeans."
"I want to talk about it, Garte."
"I'll wait here, if you need me."
"I'm not an arcanone. I'm a cop."
"I'm not sure about that, but..."
"Look, I have questions for you."
"No, I meant -- where is Shorty?"
"No, I was merely joking around."
"No, no. They can't be that bad."
"No. You need to tell me -- why?"
"Oh, so you met her? Good, good."
"Oh... thank you, kiddo. Thanks."
"Shut up and slap the butt, Kim!"
"So he lives right next to that?"
"Stay away from kipping, though."
"Tell me more about the network."
"There's no use arguing with me."
"We have no memory of this room."
"What do you mean 'you'll pass'?"
"What do you mean by 'survived'?"
"What do you mean by a 'reader'?"
"What the fuck is going on here?"
"What's a hydroelectric hydrant?"
"What's the Master Investigator?"
"What's the Production Schedule?"
"Yeah, what do you want to know?"
"You broke my neck! And my back!"
"You got me, cop man. I'm yours."
"You told him about your friend?"
"You're looking for something..."
A little tear runs down her face.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Hold on, what *is* a nock cannon?
I don't want to dig for treasure.
I'd like to hear more about that.
Out of the rain, into the gutter.
She's the one who bought the gun.
That man is *starving* for touch.
That's it? Don't even mention it?
The lieutenant makes a sour face.
They don't really give much back.
What about the incestuous banana?
What in the name of god was that?
What's with that *bratan* accent?
Wow. You might be right. Dial it.
You have no idea what that means.
You rip the shirt off the corpse.
You should *always* get your gun.
"Can I borrow that? I can help."
"Cuno won. We all agreed to it."
"Great. Let's really get going."
"How are you going to clean it?"
"How are you going to prove it?"
"How did you know I was coming?"
"How? What I'm saying, officer?"
"I didn't know you smoked, Kim."
"I don't care about the chitin."
"I don't even know what to say."
"I think they're afraid of you."
"I'm afraid you can't, officer."
"I'm not a witch, I'm a father."
"I'm only trying to be helpful."
"I'm sorry I couldn't see that."
"I'm sorry, sir, I can't do it."
"I'm talking about the *cloak*."
"It's called the off-site copy."
"Maybe it's just a coincidence?"
"No, I think I've heard enough."
"Oh wow." He's instantly hooked.
"Okay..." Ghost is ready to cry.
"So why do you call us the RCM?"
"So you're not a mass murderer?"
"Tell me, who are you, exactly?"
"That's not important. What is?"
"The creator is sexy, isn't he?"
"We should open it immediately!"
"We will see.... We will see..."
"What do you mean I *was* raped?
"What is a conspiracy theorist?"
"Why did you need to use a cop?"
"Why would you hide his *DICK*?"
"Yeah, I haven't got any money."
"Yes, that can be an advantage."
"Yes, that's it. Let's move on."
"Yes. We need to talk about it."
"You don't *know* the alphabet."
"You don't have a single guess."
"You tried to call me a f****t."
*This* is my endgame existence."
[Shut up looking at chalkboard.]
A perfectly charismatic villain.
And the larger one, on the roof?
But that's just chapter for now.
Don't tell me. Tell me. Tell me.
Even in death, life still lives.
Goddamn right. You're no dancer.
Good call, detective! What now?!
He is like a cleric, a shepherd.
He looks like he's about to cry.
He's just a scared little man...
He's just trying to impress you.
Hmm... what does one talk about?
How does what you do have to do?
It was *really* good work, sire.
No one looks up from the podium.
No... you should still say it...
Revert your eyes to the rooftop.
She is unsure of what you meant.
She takes a breath. You're gone.
Somebody needs to talk to Simon.
That's probably an empty threat.
There's a bit of doubt in there.
This is it, the moment of truth.
What about the graffito outside?
What did it say her hair is red?
What do you mean 'you're under'?
"A special forces gym teacher?"
"Cool. The economy thanks you."
"Did you shoot the hanged man?"
"Good. I don't like it either."
"Good. Now, tell me your name."
"Goodbye." (Put away your gun.)
"He's gone, Cuno. Cuno's gone."
"Hey, so you're not surprised?"
"I can do it. It's sourceless."
"I don't have. But I will try."
"I don't know where they go..."
"I don't know... just curious."
"I have finally gone insane..."
"I love it. It's so hard core."
"I need it back for something."
"I simply don't know, officer."
"I think I can hear you, boys."
"I think we're done here, ese."
"I wanted to see what happens."
"I wouldn't go so far as to..."
"I'm *deeply* indebted to you."
"I'm sorry, I just don't know."
"It's a *i*suspicion. But why?"
"It's a beautiful wall, Rosie."
"It's a fake. You're not real."
"It's not controlled, officer."
"Never mind. [Discard thought.]
"No, I just want to... please."
"No, I'll never do that again."
"No, not you. You're still me."
"Okay, I forget I *knew* this."
"Shh... just give me a second."
"So you don't know who he was?"
"So you're saying I fucked up?"
"That's a denial of liability."
"The lieutenant's on the roof."
"The scab leader is a phasmid."
"Time to go and kick some ass!"
"Um..." Klaasje looks confused.
"Wait, where are the Odd Sole?"
"What do you intend to do now?"
"What do you mean *and* *who*?"
"What do you mean -- 'casque'?"
"What do you mean by a 'sine'?"
"What do you think it will do?"
"What do you think this means?"
"What is *the* fucking potato?"
"Yeah. Yeah, I am -- wherever."
"Yes, a small, hard core band."
"Yes, the other Bob. Bob Lely."
"You know... I'm sure you did."
"You mean some clothed, right?"
"You wanted to manipulate her."
"You're an officer of the RCM."
"You're looking at the corpse."
"You're right. That's my name."
He looks more tired than he is.
Hmmmm, *brimming* with cocaine?
LORD OF GOD! WALK IN MY HEART!"
Only lovers survive the police.
The man shakes his head slowly.
There are ruins on that arelet.
THEY EAT FISH! EVERYONE LEAVES!
This man has something to hide.
What are you, your *pussy-boy?*
What is the fuss being *about*?
What's this about a *genocide*?
Yeah, maybe that's pretty cool.
You really should take this on.
Your hand is shaking with fear.
"And who are the Moralintern?"
"Do you have any radio waves?"
"Go ahead, give him a chance."
"He said he's going up there."
"Hey, it's a beautiful night."
"I think I understand it now."
"I'll try to fix it if I can."
"I'm gonna be a fucking hero!"
"I'm not a communist. I lied."
"I'm not going to let it out."
"I'm not going to... just go."
"I'm sorry. I'm bad, I'm bad."
"It's Black Friday, isn't it?"
"It's not a matter of course."
"Just boys of the apocalypse."
"Let's. I've changed my mind."
"Look, I just want to talk..."
"Man, this is taking to long."
"No one's gonna buy that gun."
"No, I can't. Gotta practice."
"No, Kim is not my boyfriend."
"No, please -- I have my gun!"
"No. I don't care about that."
"Not really, but I'd like to."
"Shit, Kim, it's the phoenix."
"Someone's been smoking here."
"That was not a pretty sight."
"That's all I needed to know."
"That's not our style, is it?"
"The hotel is pretty rundown."
"They're heavy. Noise-a-like."
"They're the rich man's kids."
"This doesn't make any sense."
"This shit's all a *pretend*."
"What do you think this *is*?"
"Yes..." He nods. "Of course."
"You don't fuckin' know, pig!"
"You mean the chimney, right?"
"You mean the kind green ape?"
FLAMING HOMOSEXUEL AGENDA GLOW
Have a look at the footprints.
He *did* see it, in his dream.
He's not *hanging* him either.
Her lips are sweeter than Kim.
I didn't mean to be facetious.
I don't wanna know about this.
Is something *wrong* with you?
Life in the void is miserable.
LORD OF HYDRAULIC COMPETITION!
The woman is dead set on this.
The words just barely fit you.
What do you have against cops?
What was that about *herself*?
Yes. You're a *beautiful* man.
You don't have a photo, sorry.
You're not so sure about that.
Your knee doesn't belong here.
"A lot of people stopped by."
"And who is the lady driver?"
"At least we are on our way."
"Do you have an... emergency?
"Don't call myself a bummer."
"Don't do my job, fuck-face."
"Goodbye, the Old Old World."
"He did it to gain strength."
"How come you're still open?"
"How did you get hold of it?"
"How did you know I was gay?"
"I am the finest of nothing."
"I need to get to the ocean."
"I'm fucking missing, Freck!"
"I'm your Revacholian bitch!"
"In your paperwork, officer."
"Is that a 'yes', or a 'no'?"
"It's a nice drive, officer."
"Just forensics, that's all."
"Let's get back to the song."
"No, he... he... hekkhhhh..."
"No, I really don't have it."
"No, tell me about the bear."
"No, that's not me any more."
"No, we need to get *tours*."
"No. I'm just not ready yet."
"None of your business, Kim."
"Seems like he was murdered."
"Something is off with Cuno."
"Ten. She's a pro. A *spook*.
"Thank you for your opinion."
"That's it for now." [Leave.]
"That's one hell of a story."
"The fuck is happening here?"
"This is a clean-up mission."
"Uh... you know... a little."
"We can take this one, then."
"Well, that's not a problem."
"What are you doing in here?"
"What do you think it's for?"
"What is a *great* question?"
"What will this all lead to?"
"Yes, that's how it happens."
"Yes, you did. What is this?"
"Yes. They're a partnership."
"You have a *point* to make."
"You're a disgrace. Get out."
"You're just not getting it."
(Get up.) "What's this shit?"
*Nah. They really did it all.
... I don't want to say that.
He's trying to sound serious.
Is that a *really* big *bow*?
No, he's not. You're useless.
Note the barely audible howl.
Rats killed a *rare* gremlin.
Revert your eyes to the roof.
She stares at you, then nods.
Then that's the weightlifter.
What could possibly go wrong?
Yes, the BOOMBAY! That's you.
Yes. Maybe. Look at the girl.
"*Disco* time, time to cry."
"*Only* bad cops stay alive"
"A lot like the one I *am*!"
"At least you're not a spy."
"Good." The lieutenant nods.
"Hold on, the bullet holes!"
"How does the dress change?"
"How old are your children?"
"I see no reason to buy it."
"I'll go with the blue sky."
"I'm a stupid guy, officer."
"I'm doing great, aren't I?"
"I'm relieved to hear that."
"I'm... not. I'm not alive."
"Is someone there with you?"
"It's cool. I'm in control."
"No, he's not. How are you?"
"Of course, ma'am." [Leave.]
"Okay. I think we're ready."
"Only bad cops say *sorry*."
"Stealing from the thieves?"
"Thank you." She looks down.
"That's all for my brother."
"The *Auschwitz* Innocence."
"The Lambyville Alphabet..."
"We'll talk more next time."
"What did you *do* to them?"
"What does that sound like?"
"What happened to the bird?"
"What is the RCM motto now?"
"What the fuck is going on?"
"What's with the tracksuit?"
"Where are the ingredients?"
"Why did he not have a gun?"
"Yeah -- that's your house."
"Yeah, I blew up the place."
"Yeah, let's go." (Proceed.)
"Yes, sure. I can see that."
"Yes, the police. You know."
"Yes. It's not a good idea."
"Yes. This guy gets around."
"You know who I am, Shanky."
"You mean the *sh*tty plan?"
"You say that as a drummer?"
"You're a detective, right?"
"You're right. I fucked up."
"You're the symbol of pain."
"You're with the rat squad!"
Careful, it's a deadly game.
He does not know *anything*.
He sounds a little like you.
He's clearly still in shock.
He's going to be very drunk.
He's just being an old fuck.
How do I get *further*, sir?
I don't wanna get into that.
I will give it some thought.
I'm not gonna bring this up.
Is that a *pile* of cocaine?
It's still all very *funny*.
Nothing is working. [Leave.]
Nothing! You're still alive.
That's a waterlogged toilet.
That's all I know about you.
The man chuckles to himself.
The old man starts laughing.
The touch of flesh on flesh.
You could say you *made* it.
You're a terrible detective.
You're right. Let's do this.
"*Remember* after you die?"
"A pharmaceutical company?"
"And... you're still here?"
"Aw, fuck, that's too bad."
"Beasts, beasts, beasts..."
"Cuno! Can we talk to you?"
"For the rear view mirror."
"Goddamn right I am, Cuno!"
"He's just a random guy..."
"Hey, I know this asshole."
"How did you get in, then?"
"How do you know all that?"
"I am, officer! Calm down."
"I did it for the workers."
"I got it from a dead kid."
"I still don't understand."
"I think I got it, thanks."
"I want to see inside you."
"I'm not gonna lie to you."
"I'm sorry you think that."
"I've got nothing to hide!"
"I've got nothing to hide."
"Is that the right number?"
"Is that why you asked me?"
"It was a bad time for me."
"It's a never-ending case."
"It's a really big world. "
"No, I don't think you do."
"No, it's okay. I'm sorry."
"No, she *is* in Revachol."
"No, that's not it either."
"Oh, you mean Measurehead?"
"Open the door, detective."
"Thank you for everything."
"This is a serious threat."
"To me, you're my partner."
"Uh..." She looks confused.
"Wait, what's *the usual*?"
"What did you *do* to her?"
"What did you *do* to him?"
"What did you do up there?"
"What do you mean *by* it?"
"What do you want to know?"
"What do you want with me?"
"What's a lower extremity?"
"What's so bad about that?"
"Who's really unconscious?"
"Why not just tell me now?"
"Yes, I know who you mean."
"Yes. The 'S' on the door."
"You can't hide it, I see."
"You don't know something."
"You're right, it's wrong."
(Sigh.) "So *very* stupid."
A *very* strange feeling...
A vicious circle of hunger.
COMMUNIST COLUMBO DETECTIVE
He glances off to the side.
His screams are beautiful h
I don't wanna shit my pants
If you ever need something.
It's back to the big thing.
Leave it nil. I don't care.
Not yet. Stop now. [Leave.]
Oh my god, what did you do?
Only lovers survive racism.
She really, really doesn't.
Soona told you about Nigel.
That's not what Cuno meant!
The lieutenant simply nods.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, that *is* a nice car.
You don't know where it is.
"Ah, I don't see... that."
"Ah, so you've *met* him."
"Are they really, though?"
"But you did talk to him."
"Do you have any ammonia?"
"Do your best, detective."
"For the room -- 60 reál."
"He got away. Most of it."
"How do you know my name?"
"How do you like it here?"
"I don't want to do that."
"I guess it's a: B trade."
"I have a search warrant."
"I'll ask later." [Leave.]
"I'll get going." [Leave.]
"I'll tell you the truth."
"I'm afraid you're right."
"I'm not being sarcastic."
"I'm not going to buy it."
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
"I'm sorry. I'm so tired."
"Is that a *black* thing?"
"It's a matter of honour."
"It's for the *holy war*."
"It's just the way it is."
"Kim, what are you doing?"
"Let's get back to Sarge."
"No, I don't think he is."
"No. I'll look elsewhere."
"Nothing. You made it up."
"Of course, the Entity..."
"Oh, no, I don't have it."
"On second thought... no."
"Right in the mouth-hole!"
"So here's your resume..."
"So you know who you are."
"So... how have you been?"
"The smoking gun, really."
"What about the building?"
"What are you doing here?"
"What do you think it is?"
"What do you think of it?"
"What is La Revacholière?"
"What was that -- a crab?"
"What's there to do here?"
"Why can't we talk later?"
"Yeah, I'm a *crazy* guy."
"Yeah, we go on, alright."
"Yeah. I told my husband."
"You seem smart, Abigail."
Cause of failure, comrade.
Doesn't it *look* awesome?
Get in and close the flap.
He doesn't have any money.
He gives her a little nod.
It *is* the entire past...
It's hard to say for sure.
LORD OF POTATO FALN SHIRTS
No. It would sound insane.
Now you're being *misled*.
She is pulling on the tie.
She stares at you, unsure.
Stupid, dumb, no good cop.
That's what she's come to.
There is a way to stop it.
Titus and Hardie. Titties.
Walk away from the fridge.
We all need a little love.
What if I *really* did it?
What is this *worse than*?
"A hunch a musician has."
"A really good question."
"Am I an expert on cops?"
"And so is your partner."
"Cuno means "Cuno sucks."
"Dumb dumb to the power."
"I did it for the Union."
"I don't need your pity."
"I have to run." [Leave.]
"I hope I've been useful"
"I need this case alone."
"I shot him in the face."
"I'm a *police officer*."
"I'm a cop, I really am."
"I'm going to fall here."
"I'm not going in there."
"I'm so fucking tired..."
"I'm with the rat squad!"
"Is that a street light?"
"It's a mental exercise."
"It's not *fascinating*."
"Maybe he's got a point."
"My work doesn't matter?"
"Okay, but what *is* it?"
"Okay, I am not a drunk!"
"Okay. Goodbye." [Leave.]
"So I'm a fucking *cop*?"
"So you're not an owner?"
"The world is overrated."
"This is now, I believe."
"Wait, what about *you*?"
"Well, I'm glad to help."
"What about the snipers?"
"What are you, a coward?"
"What did they do there?"
"What did you just say?!"
"What does it look like?"
"What in the hell is it?"
"Whoaa... that's so low!"
"Why would you say that?"
"Won't you be my mother?"
"Yes, they're all dorks."
"Yes. Like a scale, man."
"You have a point there."
"You're being sarcastic."
Damn it... I need my gun.
Defective Detective Harry
Do you really want me to?
He's trying to spin this.
How do you know his name?
How do you like this man?
I don't know. Better not.
Is it? You don't like it.
KISS MY BUTT, BUTT KISSER
LORD OF HOPE. LET ME IN."
No, but please still, do.
No. It's too far-fetched.
Shares the soup with you.
There *is* no going back.
Two figures on the spring
What? No one's listening!
"A reasonable question."
"Aye. The law. The law."
"Be careful, detective."
"C'mon, Kim, I'm close."
"Fuck you, Cuno's dead."
"Fucking lost jacket..."
"He may have been high."
"Hey boss, what's that?"
"Hi, I'm Kim Kitsuragi."
"How *amazing* is that?"
"How does one get here?"
"I have to go." [Leave.]
"I know what you meant."
"I mean, what do the --"
"I should have a drink."
"I'm looking for a die."
"I'm not a drug dealer."
"I'm sorry I'm a *cop*."
"It's a friendly thing."
"It's a very good idea."
"It's a white elephant."
"It's a... gut feeling."
"It's all right, badly."
"Kim, what about these?"
"Like a Tequila Sunset."
"No no, I mean... what?"
"No, I'm not, you know."
"No, no, of course not."
"No, not even a little."
"Okay, let's change it."
"Okay, what *was* that?"
"Okay. Let's change it."
"Okay. What is it then?"
"Shut up, motherfucker."
"So, now I'm *officer*?"
"Take off that thought."
"Thank you. That's all."
"That's all, thank you."
"That's the good stuff."

"This place is haunted."
"What about this one..."
"What did it look like?"
"What did you do, Gary?"
"What did you do, then?"
"What do you look like?"
"Who was it in Room #1?"
"Why do I want to know?"
"Why do you think that?"
"Yeah, we go on, right?"
"Yes. It is me, Eugene."
"Yes. It's my last one."
"Yes. It's my RCM unit."
"You came back to me..."
"You're right, officer."
"You're right, they do!"

A letter from the heart.
And *how* did he escape?
ASTROPHYSICS TERMINATION
He's still not quitting.
He's talking to himself.
Here comes the bad news.
I'm ready for the fight.
It is said deliberately.
Joyce told about Hardie.
Oh -- I understand then.
Okay, but how do I stop?
Slowly pull the mask up.
That's a fantastic idea.
That's the *last* thing.
The smile of a predator.
What do these even mean?
What was he waiting for?
Why can't I see the sea?
You don't have a camera.
You should see her once.
"And what do you want?"
"But it's not logical."
"Don't you like music?"
"Good call, detective."
"He's right, you know."
"How do you know that?"
"How do you know this?"
"I can't hear the end."
"I can't see anything."
"I know what you mean."
"I think I'm circa 55."
"I will." The man nods.
"I'm not here to chat."
"I'm sorry, detective."
"It's all in the mind!"
"It's the *Pineapple*."
"It's you. The police."
"No, I don't think so."
"No, I got to past it!"
"No, she was terrible."
"No. What do you mean?"
"This is our *bratan*."
"Trying to disgust me."
"Was it a sexy murder?"
"Weakness is strength."
"What happened to her?"
"What if I have drugs?"
"Where are we on this?"
"Whip it out, officer."
"Yeah, Cuno's the bum."
"Yes. This is the one."
"You know what I mean."
"You mean Measurehead?"
"You're a drag, right?"
"You're a giant, Cuno."

A bloody lip. It hurts.

A man like Titus is way
A pair -- with stripes.
Click, the light's off!
Fucking *psychic* shit.
Get up and accept it...
I can handle my liquor.
I'm actually a recluse.
I'm not gonna say that.
Lies! Lies! Lies! Lies!
MINCED MEAT SERENDIPITY
No one listens to me...
Say nothing. Just rise.
She takes another drag.
SHE'S A LIEGE REVACHOL!
The bracelet you found.
The man doesn't answer.
There's a pause. "Why?"
Wait, *the cannibals*?!
Which one do you think?
Why all the negativity?
Yes, but it's not easy?
Yes. There is no other.
YOU DRINK UNTIL YOU DIE
You're under suspicion.
"An *unofficial* name.
"And what did you do?"
"And you *know* that?"
"Can you repeat that?"
"Good luck with that."
"Have you been raped?"
"How do you work out?"
"I believe I made it."
"I certainly did not."
"I really don't know."
"I understand, ma'am."
"I'm a... psycho cop."
"I'm not saying that."
"I'm not that either."
"I've got the pieces."
"It does, doesn't it?"
"Maybe, just maybe..."
"No shit. He's a cop."
"No, it's not. Don't."
"Okay, maybe I can't."
"Sweet bourgeoisie..."
"We're not, actually."
"Weak." He looks away.
"What is *the usual*?"
"What kind of friend?"
"What's on your mind?"
"What's your problem?"
"Why is the door big?"
"Yeah, I'm a cop too."
"Yes! It was so cool."
"Yes, that's the one."
"Yes, we met earlier."
"You are an ill omen."
"You know who I mean."
"You mean *yourself*?"
"You mean the strike?"
"You're right. It is."
Another face of death.
I don't need your cup.
I'll lick your wounds.
It's me. I'm crying...
There's nothing to do.
This is important now.
What happened to Finn?
Yes, but what is this?
"A postcard, please."
"And the Union is..."
"As a cop, you mean?"
"Aye, you *know* me."
"Don't call Abigail!"
"Good luck, officer."
"How do I know that?"
"I'm a little tired."
"I'm already thirty."
"I'm not a gardener."
"I'm not going to..."
"If you say so, sir."
"It was only once..."
"It's all communist?"
"It's not a problem."
"Let's go." (End it.)
"No, he meant *you*."
"No, I really don't."
"No, this is not me."
"Of course, sweetie."
"Off we go." [Leave.]
"Oh, so you met her."
"Oh, so you met him?"
"Okay. Fuck you too."
"Show me your boobs."
"What *is* clubbing?"
"What happened, Kim?"
"What is that smell?"
"What is this place?"
"What was I singing?"
"Yes, what about it?"
"You say we're cops?"
"You're not serious?"
"You're wrong, I do."
"You... oh my god..."
*I* made my choice.''

Boyish figure of man.
Cuno pleases his pig.
Don't mind the scars.
He's clearly in pain.
How much is it worth?
I'll do that, thanks.

She shakes her head.
Silent and response.
Smash into the door.
The doorbell, *all*:
The rest is history.
Who's *Cuno* anyway?
You can't trust him.
"*Very* important."

"Yes, why are you?"
"Yes. And *ninth*."
"Yes? What things?"

It would be *cool*.
Look at the camera!
Show her the boobs.
That's a good idea.
