"*This*?" The man raises his index finger. "*The Moralintern*?"
Ginger root.
Confirmed. Your fists are still warm to touch. Your fingers are covered in a blanket of shit.
"It was a military type. They don't carry firearms in Martinaise." He points to the building behind you. "She never used it, but the armour definitely matches the barrel. She's knows something."
*Look*, it's finger-twiddling again...
"One of the most rugged and *advanced* law officers I know. A real ballbuster, that one," he says, with a peculiar gleam in his eyes.
The situation calls for a pair of chaincutters and a folding blade.
Kim flutters ominously.
"What's in this world?" (Shake it into the furnace.)
Lieutenant? Are you sure the last part wasn't the *cock parading* you?
"At the end of the last century." He pauses. "The great Skua was a Category 1 flying desperado. The last flying of the Commune. We're going to ask him how he got the finger off his cap."
A word?
"I do, Harry. And like I said before, none of this is *proof* of the inviolability of the Débardeurs' Trust. These buildings are all carbon copies of one another -- all of them are in danger of going out of date."
*Monsters* are your synapses.
"I don't even know what... you should've asked my mom."
"No, this is the RCM -- a division of the Emergency Relief Brigade."
"I'm sorry. I'm just here to do my job, Gaston. I don't know anything about anything."
ONE SPIRIT TO ONE MIND.
"I am." She nods toward the sloping mass on the sea ice.
" -- where?" (Look around in the secret rooms.)
He didn't, though. He opened his eyes and it was there -- no ball, not here.
"He was a gym teacher in the East-Insulindian Mission Church schooling boys."
This would fit the Pretty Boy mold we associate with Idiot Doom Spiral.
"I am conducting a drug trade out of this bottle." (Give it.)
I've heard the analogy made by a group of highly developed, technologically advanced people in Graad. After they had achieved certain death, certain rites began taking place...
"The Sun's gone?" The question is addressed to all of you. "Yes, that's what I thought." Shit. 
"But what if I don't want to listen to the music?"
"Good for you, officer. I think you'll get over it. Now, was there anything else on your mind?"
"There's something in you that tells me you should get out of my sight."
"hey, I'm a police officer."
Cindy the SKULL has an addictive personality.
Negotiating is a different game for you.
"It's a gun. I've changed my mind, we're fucked."
"My men could not get out of being pulled into the earth. I let them all die."
"The boy. The one with the big head."
"Are you sure?" She arches an eyebrow. "Then he's not what you were looking for..."
Vortigern is the world's largest radiocomputer, with a heat death indicator in the top-right corner. It's connected to VE, the electricity utility.
Inland Empire is as far as the eye can see: A rugged archipelago west of the Inland Sea, enveloped by the thick layer of melting ice and snow from the industrial revolution.
The plain looks old when it's just recently cracked, and by the kids you can make out the drifts of the sea.
"Don't drink the phasmids, lieutenant."
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, MAN. YOU DON'T KNOW ME!
That sounds like me, my man!
A bronze ribbon twists the bills of a young man, encircled by black letters. The letters read: 'LOG (FEB-MAR)'.
The faintest smell, like you've never felt before. Like strawberries. And the menthol flavoured chewing gum. This is what you expected.
It's love. *Again*. Shit.
"Why would anyone do that?" The lieutenant's voice is quiet, calm.
"Simple -- now that you mention it, I don't actually know any 'modern' fashionistas. My husband prefers books to be directly involved in *fashion* right now, ha ha."
Your hand is still clasping his head. Its white thread is trembling in your fingers.
Make sure you're sure. You can always talk her out of it later.
You have a pang of guilt about this dress. Try to control yourself.
NOOOO!
"What would he say?" She doesn't know the answer yet, she won't lose herself in her own words.
Hold yourself together. [Wait 0.5 seconds.]
"What has he been drinking?"
"I wanted to see if the old man was in there." She points to the red door.
No. This is bad. She's right. You should go back and talk to him.
It's just going to come to us, you know.
"No idea. Maybe some *other* thing." She lets out a sigh. "Any ideas?"
"It's a very difficult subject to tackle. I think we could all do our part."
It's a *modesty*, of course. She would love it if you did the dishes at last -- but you're too fat for her.
"The man was a very successful entrepreneur."
"I need you to open this door.
"I do not *understand* now."
It's *not* a question.
"Yes." He nods approvingly. "What is this new drug called?"
HARRY THE VODKA COP
You're so *very* alive right now. This is the most liveable thing for sure. You've got this.
"Well..." He hesitates, as the water is starting to run. "You have the gun."
And a bad case number. The lieutenant doesn't see the point of questioning yet. What if she doesn't have the gun?
"I do not believe you. We should continue our search -- until we have our hands free to pursue a solution to the case."
She is. She *is* your real, complete and eternal *slave*.
I'm not sure I have what I need, can I reach the roof and get help?
"I'm glad you agreed." He takes one long drag and then says with quiet disdain: "Now we just need to talk. About how the police have fucked you over."
There goes the old man's cigarette and a bitter after-life smoke hangs over all the you. In front of them, a long time ago flows...
Wait, are we done talking about the fucking kipt?
"Good morning, officer." The lieutenant turns to you.
Yeah! So these *cops* are... I don't even wanna think ...
"Why do *you* think he did that?"
"Well, not really." He looks at you and the lieutenant, then you.
"That's what I've always thought: the future of art -- and the future of humanity."
"Look at all this stuff, it's cool. There's nothing I'd rather do with my life."
A moment passes. He shrugs off your question. He looks at the wall.
This *is* what is called a *disfigurement*.
"Of course. The sooner we have them here, the sooner we can get moving again."
"We're not here to make a killing, Mr. Evrart."
"Yes." The young man pats the jacket on the floor. "He's the kind of guy you can't bring back for a second chance. You never get that lucky with him."
"No, really, I need them for something... I don't even understand what the hell I'm trying to achieve with this project."
"The *fatal accident* had little real effect, I am the one you are alluding to here."
He's listening!
"Maybe you want to get back to the case? You have any leads?" He turns to you.
"Yeah." He nods eagerly. "I've heard Cuno say shit about the *paratroopers* too. I'm alright with that. They're good."
"You don't seem too happy about this. Do you have anything to tell me?"
"We all do." The old librarian says to you, watching you approach with both eyes. "It's my job to know the world."
"You know," a little smile grins at you from the corner of her eyes. "A common misconception, that's why the RCM doesn't have much of a track record in these things."
Maybe he *should* have more cash?
"No, he's an official." The man looks at him like he's in a bad mood. "He only says what the official does."
"He's glad to see you limping back here. Let's talk about something else."
She's not even living up to her *ladies*' kind. She's a recluse, a whore, a whore, a whore...
"There was a *f****t*. A big one. I think he lives in a church. A pretty big church."
*Doomer* is a euphemism for *doomed*. It's a catch-all term for officers of the law.
It looks like some kind of contraption like the one that makes music out of reeds is spinning around in here.
"Do you work in pale transport?"
"Don't be silly, they're not... they're not fucking monsters! They're human..."
It seems as though you were a *little* bit careless asking this one out. He doesn't like the wordy kind.
The lieutenant nods. "This is a *serious* matter, sir."
And then there's the fact... that his room is unguarded and that you can just *walk* in there and get around...
"Well, maybe. Anyway, I've got a preliminary examination to attend to."
"Cuno's got a very *good* way of communicating with the air. If it wasn't for the sound we would not have gotten out there!"
"Yes, my name. My name is Andre... Andre the Giant. And I'm a giant." He takes a small step toward to massive door.
A *welkin* is not a person. It does not live or breathe. It is not a mammal, and neither are the *sans boiadeiro*. Both are animal species that are considered to be the *supreme beings*, superior in many ways to humans.
But it's just you. A giant, floating block of marble in the middle of a sea of people.
The lieutenant leans in and inspects the man.
He has a *massive* gun as his *primary* weapon. It's like you just stepped into the future.
A gun!
A *gun*?
It's an *un-rewardable* prize. The most likely outcome is that you will die trying to crack this case.
"It's okay, officer." She turns away from you. "I... uh... I don't like it here. It's really cold here. I hope you don't mind."
Of course you do, just ask her where she's from.
"Oh, really?" There's a smirk on her lips. "Oh yes, very *serious* indeed."
"A single, clear shot and he would be dead."
Not good -- that doesn't sound right.
"Riding the cock parade, I see."
You know, it's kind of pathetic that you never learned the *truth*, but let's be honest, he's probably lying.
There must be a way to *lie* so you can get the facts?
"The fuck are you talking about, you stupid fuck? *I* told you it was okay, I told you everything was okay!"
"No. It's not. You cannot *escape* from your thoughts. What you are -- is not. You are an entroponetic entity."
It is not what you were hoping for, but this does not have to turn out to be an *embarrassment*, please.
You should ask the lieutenant what's going on. The situation is dangerous.
"You know, detective," the lieutenant says with a nod, "I *am* not your *sanction.* My badge is for a different officer, and I have been looking for her..."
"Good luck then."
The corpse-scented beast looks around in the reeds, looking for a scent it can use.
"I don't know..." he rubs his temples. "What was the name of your game?"
He takes off his glasses and puts them down. "I think everything works out. Let's just get back to it."
"Why, thank you, lovely lady, but your *unusual* generosity is not reflected in my ledger." He points to his ledger.
"What..." the lieutenant whispers to you, not wanting to *disagree* with the man. "Is this man your man?"
"I do want to." (Lie.)
"I would never lie." (Lie.)
"Did a drunk drive the truck right through you?"
"And he was on the run and now he's a scared drunk behind a fucking payphone?"
"Okay, so let's do this." (Accept.)
"It's not really good for me, and I'll take it off." (Decline.)
"Why didn't you think of that?"
"I don't know what the FUCK she's talking about. She only used her own money to buy those clothes."
"I know where the body is, I just need to finish my preliminary examination."
"If only the right words were spoken..."
"Look at Kim, he's so fucking cute!"
"This is a *stray*, right? You need to tell me!"
"Yeah, Cuno likes it."
"You don't like the *Pissf*****t* one?"
"I'm looking for a way to *re-conceptualize* the *Pale Intensifier*."
"You think maybe it's connected to the murder?"
"Wait, I meant your partner?"
"You said "Fuck him", aren't you the same race?"
And you *don't* trust them, you don't want to think about the other things said!
"You were thinking," he says with a smirk, "that maybe the hanged man's shirt was the source of our *irreducible* strangeness, and that we're not supposed to care."
"But it's really you!"
"I don't want to hear about your problems!"
"I'm sorry I doubted your mettle earlier. I'm a hard nut to crack, I'll just leave it at that."
*Bizarre*? Who's *wrong* now?
The lieutenant raises it to inspect the photo.
"I was born ready. I just need a bit of practice first."
"I don't *have* to worry about anything, I just need to keep my head above water..."
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "We should be cautious -- and not get entrapped in anything he might be suggesting."
It's you.
(Point at the back of your head.) "Look at me! I'm a robot."
"I guess this will do." (Tap your chin.)
"The most difficult part was actually getting him down, because in the evening you woke me up in the middle of the night. With the blanket wrapped around your neck, and the sheets wrapped around your body. You were cold. It was... unhygienic."
"But he is not an official RCM substation."
"Ahem. To be perfectly honest, I've always disliked the look of him. He was a *cocaine* addict like myself."
"They say this town is part of the Doomed Commercial Area. In Martinaise, a residential neighbourhood, near Canal. For the first ten years or so of Revachol's economic woes -- and certainly after the turn of the century."
"You got lucky, detective." (Point to your head.) "Like, really lucky. The locals, everyone thinks you got away with murder because you were young and silent."
"Yes." He takes a sip of beer. "A little something to ease the minds of those
"But why would you want to buy anything? You seem like a normal, regular person."
"No. I'm sorry."
"Just tell me, amirite?" (Try to conceal it.)
"Yeah, well, Cuno thinks you've got a thing for him. That fucking pig, Cuno likes him." He takes a sip of his beer.
"You know, when Cuno isn't around..." He nods to you again, then suddenly his expression changes. "Cuno gets really chill, he doesn't like the fuck that Cuno does."
"No, I'm the fuck up with it right now!"
"We're all pigs, pig!"
"Oh yes -- of course. You've been such a bother to me -- having two bums in a row..." She puts her fingers in her mouth to stop laughing. "It's okay, Fred. No one's going to listen to me now."
"The *ex-something*. A *gangsta* life." He looks at the crowd of people -- some of whom look unpleasantly relieved.
What is he, a mass murderer?
"You mean, like a *mulkku*? A *mulkku* is a mass murderer. *You* can't beat someone else to death with a mulkku." He seems genuinely excited. "I mean a mass murderer who's out of bullets."
"No. That's right. We are *officers* of the law. It's our duty to make arrests. It's our job. Now..." She takes a final drag of her cigarette, before tossing it back to her.
"No," he says in a hushed voice. "I can't talk my way out of the curse, you see. It's too much."
"I need to know, Kim."
Yes, it might actually be a good idea to remove the magnet.
His heart beats faster with every word. Like the final resting spot of a racing track leading to triumph and tragedy in the afterlife.
But there isn't more. It is as if you're using an entirely different set of words.
"He got shot in the head. In the head fucking hard. Like he was fucking... shot to death."
Suffocation. He's right. You shouldn't do that.
What was that? A little light? A twitch?
"A *gangster*, eh? Sounds like it's a *mafia* thing." There's genuine seriousness in his voice.
"*You're* a goddamn communist!"
"Did I help you, Eugene?"
"You heard me. I needed your help. Now, can you please step back and let the ladies be?"
In his eyes, time starts spinning *round*. You feel the world go back and forth on the walls of the room. The lights turn on and illuminate a blur, like the shapes appearing from some far-off place, like a dream...
"Ahem." The lieutenant is listening with great attention to your every word.
"My husband has Alzheimer's disease."
"This is the door to your room," he says as if you need instructions. "You will need to get in through this."
"You should get this shit out of the way."
"Momma said if you see a man wearing a red wig and a matching eye patch, she's gonna call the station and let them know. So I went around *Krenel* -- Krenel *officers*. Now, I went around Krenel *innocent*."
I think Kim would appreciate it.
"We do have it. Let's keep it moving."
(Rip into him with your teeth.) "Kim, it's not just me. We were looking for her, and now we found her."
"I can't see what it was that made you so *uncomfortable*... maybe it was your *hypothesis*."
"What's the status of the excavation?"
"You said nothing."
"This is a game!" She grunts. "That's it! You don't have an opinion. You can throw rocks at it, it doesn't move. You don't even have to do anything."
She does not look back, only forward, a look of bewilderment on her face.
"If we're going to treat human beings like *decoys* I need you to fuck off, pig."
There's something you've missed.
In the north-east, four men and one woman wear sandals and carry long belts. Their aim is to *retaliate* against the drug trade.
An old woman stands in front of a huge mural that depicts a white horse, flapping its wings, and an old pilot flying the C-Wing. In the background, a young girl with wide shoulders, long flowing robes and dark hair dances on the air.
"Okay, alright..." The lieutenant looks up and shrugs.
"I think I have it. Let me know when you've had a chance to look around."
She looks at you with pleading eyes. "Don't kill yourself, dear Mr. Dros!" she cries out of concern, as her hands are on the controls.
You've probably done it before.
"So -- that's what you're interested in."
So you're not fucking shitting yourselves that you thought I was lying to you.
He nods. "All I can say is: good on the job. What more can I say about that?"
"No. I think we have a full on *story* here. A true-life case of the apocalypse."
"No, nothing like this happens around here. Our station is pretty high-net-worth."
The lieutenant looks at you, a little disappointed but not too disappointed.
"Yeah, don't fuck us all up," he says with a grimace. "We'll only get weaker."
"No, it's a joke. I'm actually not laughing, because you just killed one of my favourite heroes. I thought the idea was too good to pass up..."
"Whoa..." He rubs his face in frustration. "Yeah, man. Cuno's pretty bored right now. Cuno's not really into you guys."
"You see, like... the way the world works, you can never really trust everything. I'm here to tell you what I think."
"He's a gangster, Kim. Like all the ones."
She doesn't reply. Just looks in the direction of the radiocomputer.
"The most recent entry says..."
"Okay. That's cool."
"What do you mean by *lividity*, exactly?"
"It's good to talk to someone. I can be helpful."
"I see." He turns to check the room again. "We should get moving. Let's check out the radiocomputer."
"That's not the *true* story. I didn't kill him. He was probably shot down. A cowardly soldier."
He knows you're thinking badly of him. You've let him down again.
"What if the Union *kills* itself out of solidarity?"
That's a dumb idea.
"This is your police? This is what cops are meant to do? Take the law into their own hands? I don't think that kind of approach *works*, but it would be nice if we could at least consider it..."
"I'm not interested in contraband, officer. Just police business. Tell me what you want." (Proceed.)
He's not lying about it -- this is very well done.
"I was asked to look into this murder case you mentioned. I'm not sure I can comment on it at this point, though."
"I'll tell you what this jacket is..."
She's not. They're *always* looking for something illicit...
"I think I have it all figured out, actually."
The lieutenant is not amused.
"It's you, officer..." His voice trails off into a gust of sea wind.
It's the night air, brooding away the city life. It's all gone now, the city...
"The man who walks like a man," he points West, "is an old man. He doesn't do *anything*. You think you saw the face of something? I can't *see* it."
"I don't know how I feel. About that drug trade."
"Fuck are you fucking TALKIN' about?"
"We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't even started yet."
"How are you gonna get in?"
(Turn to Kim.) "It doesn't matter, this is no time for frivolity."
"I did it for the environment."
"How do you know this? I haven't seen you around here before."
It's clear from her voice that she doesn't want to get into it. Too much as far.
"You're right about the age and health problems we're talking about though. *Age* is a thing you can suffer from, from a very young age."
He was wearing a dark brown leather jacket over a tan pantsuit, as he stepped out of the Whirling-In-Rags lunch spot. A black rectangular stain was visible under the washboard that shows just under the knee.
Let's hope nothing bad happens.
(Put it back down before it's your turn.) "So you haven't *taken* it from me?"
"A little late for that, I think..." She shrugs. "It'll come to him again. One day. It'll take some time -- at least a year?"
"I found two sets of footprints, but could not identify the tracks because the print does not look like a single stride. There are only two of the three pairs of prints we have together, and you cannot *decide* which one is the right one. It would be a minor miracle."
Yes, he was not wearing a jacket. But the moment he got up, that jacket felt right at home on his large frame. It was... warm.
"I'm looking for a *bulk load* of alcohol. Can you help?"
(Whisper.) "Kim, you've been *verbally* harassing my partner."
"What? No. Why not?" He shrugs. "I have plenty of goods to buy. This is not a vast market. You don't need everything from Isobel Sadies..."
The sun peeks over the clouds. A small vessel -- no larger than a sail -- makes its way over the coast, slowly, with lanterns flashing among the various parked motor craft.
He was a good and sober man, who made his way through a lot of difficulties and *did not* become a socialist.
"Cuno, let's open it. It's Cuno's turn to open the door now."
"Okay. But *why* would I..."
"Yeah, I'm not a 'hands-on-a-plate' type, man. I'm a bit of a *tourist* kinda guy. Taking all kinds of scenery with me."
Just leave him alone. That will *surely* contain the smell.
"I'm sure that once I am here I will be able to shed some more of my inhibitions and truly grasp the mysteries of reality." He looks around. "At some stage, yes."
You feel it, but something tells you... the presence is impersonal, not at all like the others.
(Whisper.) "Kim, check this out!"
The old woman is silent and unmoving. The pendant around her neck jingles with an imperceptible treble.
It's like the rain -- you feel it coming, running, gurgling somewhere in the cellar, underground.
"Are you a member of the *curse* then?"
"Wait, I have an *investigation* to attend to before I can ask Mr. Claire about this again -- I have to go."
"No, they didn't take the body down myself. Police officers don't go around *asking* people for personal information like that. I can talk to them..." She stops, as if she was about to continue walking through the gate.
"Maybe the Wild Pines has *not* listened to us? Shouldn't they have?"
The door to the 'personal log' is wide open.
"So the boat is back up at The Loo. I think we should let them know what we found. That way, they won't have time to take it down..." He looks east. "If they were here, they would know we took it."
"I've kept my nose out of the ocean because I believe it in my own blood."
"A good guy..." He looks down. "He's seen my progress. I can appreciate that. He *is* a decent guy. He'll come around."
"You're right, let it be like this. The only thing I haven't solved is the mystery of the phasmid."
"Aye, so here you are. Early bird gets the worm, I can tell you -- you're one of my sweet lost friends. I've said it two thousand times now. I'll always remember it. Thank you."
The lieutenant steps closer, still a solid metre away...
*Babybeard*, *the buggar*. Was he born with a gun in his hands?
The yellow and red ligature marks are almost illegible in the blade, but the smallest -- where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag -- are seen where the skin above the eye-liner folds up like a candy bag.
"A book, maybe?"
A sudden, violent flash of indignation.
"Remarkable. I have no comments -- can we get back to our cases now?"
Yeah, you're probably one of the wannabe-skulls types, or perhaps you're just some high-school bullying enthusiasts...
Did... he actually think you were a police officer?
This is probably what happened to Revacholian communism.
"I'm not waking this one out." He shakes his head. "I'm gonna pull my fat ass out and this will be the good disco I've havent felt in years."
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"Do they sell them?"
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
"Hm, sorry."
"Apologies."
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
"Yes." The lieutenant nods. "You have my full cooperation. I don't know anything about that."
"Do they sell them?"
"I am an entrepreneur, I make sure everyone has the right investment."
"I'm sorry I'm the only one left here, Tequila. I don't know who's out there or who's not catfishing. I just know it's hard to climb out of those windows."
"Hm, sorry."
"Apologies."
"It's a matter of who knows what. The more we know the better."
*Oi no use jumping to these conclusions. There's something very wrong with you. And you will not get ME!
The air is cold. You hear the distant murmur of motor-connections somewhere south of here.
*Everyone* knows how to put it -- missing people is not important to you. Are you sure it didn't turn out like that?
"They couldn't just animate it in the chimney. They had to keep it in."
"A young woman? Or a woman from the district of La Delta?"
Deeper. The dark hall of the secret tunnels...
Won't this Frisby mess make you into a real party boy?
Harry drags his gaze away from the curtains.
Because I *hate* you.
Indeed. Like a spider, spider is capable of turning any feeling into an excruciating pain. This makes it all the more remarkable that this man could even be a pretty super-detective.
"I'm doing this
Doesn't want to get crowned Revacholian.
Their extinguished fires warmed her warm.
"Oblivion -- I love it, it's my mainstay in this house. It gives me security and helps with the cold. It's a *natural* painkiller. It's what I have. It's good for me."
Not guilty, you're just going to let it go.
Another Sad FM Child
"I am a bit surprised to hear that." He turns to the woman. "You're a black sheep. The shepherd of sheep. All I know is, I will die soon."
The end. It must be... terrible, oh oh... awful.
Still, Acele can tell when one's not *just* with his *eyes*.
Read,drinker and die.
*Then*? Who would do that?
"I didn't. You seem invested in this."
"I am a violent man. I can't have pig-bears all the time."
"So... uhm... the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua?" She looks half-bored for a moment, or you'll get another beer.
And where is it from?
*Economic*? Huh? Something morbidly funny under the pretence of explaining how economy works.
"I am the voice of reason, but I also have the *moral* to go around robbing people."
"I didn't object. I'm an *establishment*."
**Dealing* with the Union? That sounds *crazy* to me.
Cursed Iilmaraan book.
Do you want to know what happens when you call her again?
"Hey!" He turns a tap on the pipe. "I hear you, buddy-boy. You wanna get some 'er?"
"I'm sorry, this place is a veritable underground labyrinth of crime and waste disposal."
"I've been thinking... what *paranoid behaviour*." (Point to your head.)
"There's something I can do for you. Help you fix this." (Give him the sandwich bowl.)
*ORDER NOW!* Press ENTER.
"He's gone." (Conclude.)
With longing, she squints her eyes, hoping for something...
Sir, let it go! She's not going to come up with anything on her own. You're too embarrassed to take it off now.
"Where can I find them?"
"Fucking *world-class* armour."
Marie? She doesn't look like anyone you could come by coincidentally, it's more like an artificial eyelid.
See you. Thank god he never existed.
So this is how it's going to go: bad for your health, the perception of a leader of men has been... basically wrecked.
He walks away with a weary smile, his cigarette ash falling silent on the railing.
Besmertnyé?
"*Mon dieu*," he sighs. "May the purity of love guide them to the path. May their souls guide them to the land of the pure."
Tell her she has the right armour.
Different, he thinks. Why would you waste time if you're *not* talented?
The Trash Collection Service? That's a *real* TipTop Tutti. It's in Revachol. In Couron.
"Is that so, sister?"
The window feels very cold. The wind howls in from the city, sweeping your clothes on the rooftops...
"You're not. You're a cop, after all."
"I didn't act on instinct. I'm an incompetent *wunderbar*."
"I don't know what. I don't know what to do..." she suddenly says.
What is *totally* happening, isn't it?
"He missed his family." The lieutenant's voice is calm as a blade.
"I do," she nods. "How long has he been on the force?"
"I work hard. I like it cold," she responds.
It's been used as a training ground by some 'Monseignantes' -- the union-loyalists who are supposed to guard over and protect the Commune.
Sure, you're twenty two. What are you going for there? A kid? A cop?
*You* would have spared the lives if it weren't for your sleeve.
"I'd rather die than see this."
"If I *want* to hang you myself, you're going to have to do it myself. In a juvie-bourgell. In a juvie-bourgell."
"No, no-no," he finishes. "You've really fucked yourself, f****ts. *You* are the real heroes in the matter. You're the real cause of cell-phone doom. Now get it together and watch your friends die!"
"Titus, you're getting *into* me."
You've managed to do that, now you've managed to speak
"A hole in the world?"
"Oh." He looks worried. "But you were supposed to give her your questions."
"People tell me, and the kids in Martinaise, I'm their buddy. We work together. This isn't some act...."
Still? Probably. Keeping a low profile is important -- for historical reasons.
"I'm not an idiot, I just happen to be a fan of the fan."
" *Androgynous*. Haircuts and skin colours... and a hint of adventure. "
"Any time. There's only one way to get to it. We can't just leave. It's too dangerous. And too dangerous... anyway."
Lieutenant, you're not too sorry about that. Just *one* mistake...
Guess... this would look totally implausible if you were to just... let you off the hook.
The window feels cold. The wind howls in from the city. An old woman stands there, ash-caked, staring at you.
The airways above the buildings creak and roar.
"Are you alright, officer... I haven't been able to take you... please step out of my sight!"
"Good," she responds with a cursive smile.
* ostensible, but what the *actual* contents* are more complex and opaque. It's more like you're...
"Fucking whore..." The old woman's face is motionless.
The boots fit you. The pain must be immense.
"KILL? SPLAT DOWN, BETWEEN THE COUNTLESS HEROIC MATTERS YOU HAVE RECEIVED THROUGH YOUR MIND!"
*Psychic* approach!
That shit ain't telling you anything!
carefully, so you don't fall over on your left side.
"I'm a smart cop. I think I'm smart."
"I do," she nods.
No, you *need* to be in the game before you can complete it.
"I can't say it doesn't get lonely."
"I'm afraid the RCM will be here shortly. Have you seen them around?"
Went straight. At your own pace. This sounds like *well tuned* Wirrâl. Wirrâl sounds... *well tuned* to me. WIRrâl sounds. Wirrâl! Wanna see why?
"Shall we go and get the spirits now?" (Proceed.)
have you tried? You fucking gonna let that guy go, Cuno?! This is your fault for letting your mind go to shit, brother.
Goddamnit... you shouldn't have done that. You know it.
*Establishment* is the practice of enticing people into committing suicide.
Boy, you've said plenty of things right and asked plenty of people. That won't work.
"Are you alright, Harry? You were drunk."
"I was always worried about you. I thought you were a menace to the good order..."
"Okay. Nothing major. Just wondering..."
"I am *not* going to entertain anyone with this any more."
"It's not *that* cool."
"No matter. You ruined it."
A dumbfounded, you hear the machine whir back to life. The words: "Detective -- Klaasje -- Only Human."
"I am cool, Kim."
"I wouldn't go in for that. I'm sure I wouldn't get caught..." She points across the water, where the strandbare grass is growing darker.
no, not disco... disco lights, glittering... god dammit...
A big smile quivers on his face as he replies: "Sure. How else can I help you?"
"I'm a policeman myself, that's why I have the best theories."
"Something to think about, don't you think?" She looks around, then points her cigarette at the ground. "Right now."
"The crates are all worthless. And your investigation will be over before you find what really entroponetized you."
"I'll leave that to your judgement."
A well-meaning but superficial deduction. You're a smart cop and you can see the world, but...
But don't drive.
In easy access it curdles into four parts:
A set of? You know the ones! The kind with the spotted feet? The Lilly Boy...
Finanzo 'Dr John' Cranbrook
Spit flies from your mouth. Your shoulders slump down.
flat, white lies all over.
The gardener observes you
Time to go. [Leave.]
"I just don't wanna talk about it. Let's move on." (Don't take the case.)
The plastic jumps open on the inside. The food itself is white, but it still smells of salt.
As if it's not snowing completely. All the lights in the world turn on, invisible towers above Martinaise roll into focus as the city draws closer to us. Stations of light rise and fall on the city, all warning of what's to come...
no, it's not! It's not a "roo!"
"I found this book. Thank you, Trant." (Conclude)
What's *your*? You look like a hobo.
What does? belongs to you. The *ace* in between the thirds.
* *AUTOMATIC SHOES* -- it's the name of one of the pioneering text-based systems used by the multinational corporations operating in these environments.
You mean someone who's out working night clubbing? Sure, you do, but who cares?
Church
The crackle of metal, metal, the creaking of wood, the bass of music, the creaks of waves... You feel that child's weight shifting around in your skull, pulsating through you, until everyone is on equal footing...
"Pardon me... I thought you'd appreciate a good adventure through the blue waters." She looks worried. "I'm sorry, lieutenant, I'm not sure I convince you all the time."
Your coronary artery is intact. It's blocking the blood from flowing properly through your body. You should get a chest X-ray to check your coronary arteries.
"It's just a story, Harry. It's not a serious matter."
Maybe the missing locusts were entombed there, in the traps planted by Evrart's deceit.
*And* you're a coward.
"A prayer." She nods. "Let's see if the spectral hand of nature is holding back the *deluge* that's coming."
flares all the sines together, so naturally they play those sounds with equal gusto: *piss
"What happened?" your partner starts, as he continues to stare at his logs.
"I'm scared! Watch your hand raises, it's trying to wipe your face clean. Leave the Cuno here pig-headed. Cuno's gonna be *in* the Cuno-head!"
"The officers are gonna have to read that decision."
"I'm sorry to interrupt your thought, partner, but my partner, Glen, was just trying to impress your partner with some pretty amateurish moves. We've had a fair share of arguments."
Your brother is always watching over you. Always telling old stories and inspecting your mental health.
"Dora, I'm sorry. I'm the one who always stays at your place. To the side when you're away. To nurse those unfortunate men, when they're sick. I... I just... I can't."
"Do they?" She raises her brow, confused.
"Give me a moment. We've been running around together doing *bad* things."
Nah, this was a good question. The guy seems to be *confiscating* things.
"It isn't." The lieutenant takes his glasses off to polish. "This is a pretty *significant* development. We should move on."
It's not because you're any good. Not today, no more.
"What proof?"
The Stalwart Way is an organization of archaeologists, carpenters, graphic designers, and those who love to travel! It's what regular people do when you want to impress the world!
"No, I don't think so." (Look around.)
Not one, but three things. The creature is tall, dark, and completely silent. It has a bulbous, shiny, jelly-shaped head like that of a *monkey*, and no eyes on either end. It haunts the ruins left over from the battle.
"Until you started *vodka-fucking*.... it was all fucking you."
"I am barely keeping you together here. The days are long, the work is never-
"Not when you're wondering if your doorbell is being snooped on." She corrects her hat. "Your hair is welkins to cover your eyes. Your hat is welkins."
"A teenage runaway. A *queen regnant*."
* *You*..."
"Isn't that what you were saying?" The lieutenant looks at you, then at Kim. "May I ask about something else?"
"Okay. I'm Billie. My name is Billie. How can I help you?" She walks away.
This year he leans in more deeply, like he's about to say something: "As you can see, the perforation on the side of the bay is enormous. It's where the human were..."
You're getting a nihilistic vibe from that sentence. It's not connected with hangovers.
*Snap!* The act of touching away feels almost touching.
Doesn't feel... super.
You're just a figment of your imagination.
The wind picks up, young Claire looks around. There's a chance it's her daughter, Little ELIZABETH, who's in the backyard!
You have a pretty good case to solve, right? Go to the aerodrome. Art is the light at the end of the tunnel. Go find art. Get rich.
"Oh no?" he throws you a sharp glance. "You're not."
Won't? You're under stress. Or not under a detective at all. This is your chance.
*This* is what Cuno calls aopathic, *because* he believes the world is corrupt. He's got that swishy *detector's* bag."
Son. Who is it?
"I don't *have a fridge*, I have a gun."
What's with the wet tongue?
"Dora?" she's hesitating, "you're trying to say this is the Wild Pines rep?"
The glint in her silver eyes tells of the weariness and exhaustion on Suzerain's part. She's almost ready to nod, but...
"I'm pretty sure you're working class. I'm your type. You live nearby."
Do not interrupt him. "PIGS IN C, COCKS IN C!"
"Oral cavity screening? You were just having a bad day. Or you were in a *fight*?"
"What can you tell me about this... spooky guy?"
This is probably what's going to happen when you meet your future husband.
"Yes. Of course. Thanks, for getting me and my friends in here. And we hope you do too."
"The Hardie boys are on to something here."
Solving this race mystery is proving a little difficult. Even the professionals agree that it's time.
"I found the thing. Just took a look."
Have other thoughts?
*Mon die* -- literally "Mon die" -- is what's referred to here as a *deconstruction*.
Gender equality is a *growing* possibility in the coming decades, don't you think?
*Puts everything first*
Up here -- on the seafort -- on this coast -- you will find a hidden corner of the world called Oblivion.
* *The Man from Hjelmdall*... what *has* he done?
"Yes, I just thought they had it, we all have our things -- drugs and porn stars."
*Stop* is within your grasp.
"Garbage..." The lieutenant assesses the situation. "Is there anything we can do to assist you?"
With an unrestrained pang of self-interest.
A face that reminds you of kitchen help.
What is it? Where is it? Where is that slap?
"I'm an okay man, so let's talk about something else."
Read your answer.
Ugh... you're nodding too. You're just going to have to keep nodding, and make up your mind, CAPITAL. You're a great idea.
"Serious business, you are one strange cop. Think about it, actually!"
Reality, in its discomen, harbours little desire to admit the error of its ways. It only cares for its enemies. It is but a dim dimple cast aside by their insignia.
"I'll put you on speaker, Hypothetically."
"The lock was supposed to be broken in by a local shopkeeper, by the way -- I saw him there yesterday. He was wearing a brown raincoat. I called the station and they were supposed to be out Monday. It was Monday, but they told me they would be Monday. They told me yesterday was a good day."
"I'm sorry. Sorry I couldn't help more." She looks down and falls silent.
"Oughts?" The young man frowns. "Well, I wouldn't be worried about a lost jacket like you..."
"I still don't understand what you're doing in the city," he says after you've agreed to talk to him. "There's something *wrong* with that man..."
All I can, I'm gonna go with
"AUGUSTA, NOW GO ON AND RIDE THE P-R-R-ROCKETS!"
The dark sarcophagus... looks like the person behind it. Maybe you should come back to this *thing*-based questionnaire later, just in case.
"Where can you get your hands on that?" The lieutenant looks at you, then you.
Good. Now roll and tell the tale. (Finish thought.)
The amphetamine lab? That sounds rather bad. This is where you say your awful ass was. You're in there.
So what? You're under orders...
*Bratan*, you've proven yourself capable of anything in this world, but now you've come to the end of your rope.
"Hm... I don't know, I don't know what happened."
"You were trying to get me to do a favour for *you*. You wanted me to do it. You promised to do it *only* for me."
Harry Evrart
Police regulations strictly limit the right amount of background information a police officer can share with anyone under their jurisdiction. This would only be a problem if there were a background check on officers across the board.
" Great news, officer, I didn't mean to imply that you're under stress. Now I'm going to put you in a *rest* unit and you're going to understand."
Welcome, your lost friend, someone new to this tableau -- it's me. The crown of delusions is yours. Take note of it.
I am so very sorry for your loss.
I don't think he's that bad.
Known and forgotten. Enforcing habits. Humanity's garbage.
"I am barely keeping you together here, but I'm getting somewhere... There is no friend."
"Good! 'Toratürk'  -- what else can I do for you?"
This is a very, very bad thing.
PRESSURE! You felt it -- THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- TOWARD THE MOTHER OF YOUR ENTIRE NURSES. YOU MUST MAKE IT THROW WHOM IT IS THROWING.
"I've got someone *here*."
This would make quite a statement in your living room.
Your fingers feel red, like lead. From the blood in his chest
It's not because you're a *scientist*, is it? Just a little more!
"Good to meet you." The woman nods. "I've always wanted to hear about your research. Did you pursue that goal myself? You inspired some of the great *triangles* back in the U.S."
"I can't say. It was there." She puts out of mind's grasp. "Where was I then. When I was hunting for that key I decided against it."
Frequency Fireplace
"I am sorry I don't have the tools to do this. I'm still the Sorry Cop." (Pat your friend's shoulder.)
"7th FEB, '54."
Almost there. You've earned it.
PRESSURE! YOU FEEL IT THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE HEAD -- THROUGH YOUR NURSES AND INTO YOUR GIACLE FORTY YEARS AGO. EVERYWHERE YOU MOVE IS IN MISSIONS AND IN AIR MILES WITH THOUSANDS OF CARIBBEERS.
Time to talk politics! All this talk of *you* is *wounding* you! WAIT! You'll get the key from the karaoke carousel!
This is about three metres tall, almost two meters tall, and weighing almost two tons. It's political. The one about two metres tall just doesn't care about that.
Mullen's an honest man, if he doesn't seem like a cop he's got a nice soul, good for his special tie.
*Racist* swear words.
"Fucking..." he squints. "You can't see, you fucking fat fuckshit... Cuno doesn't have shit. You look like you were *built* to fight."
"I understand," the lieutenant looks around. "It's less about *anodic dance music* than it is about territorial losses."
"The company's ailing. The next batch will be renewed for a three-year term. It's impossible to imagine a more *cursed* entity rolling out a 'ka-ching' than the artificial insemination unit."
"The Ptolemy? That makes no sense -- and furthermore, there's no pale, at least not from what I understand it to be the case."
The man wavers under the lieutenant's arms.
What is this missing machinery is involved with?
"Family?"
"I'm sorry, I'm being too hard core here."
"What is it, what are you doing?"
U4? Oh, sorry. It just wasn't my style.
He's back to telling you all he knows. A trooper has been assigned to your case -- and he knows *exactly* what you *didn't* think.
You have a feeling your skull would crack if you told it to tell you what you *can't* eat.
"I'm sorry I don't have a gun."
Footprints in the dust below the stench.
The horse sits on the wet ice, its joints twisting like ancient chitin.
Are you sure you don't need it?
"Why the fuck would he want to *promise* anything?"
"I'm a policeman, I don't need any badges or medals for that. I'm a professional."
You shudder, as the great bird of a lower intestine cavents an unknown evil. It's very close to your face, and judging by the way she's moving, it's very unlikely you're imagining it.
Katarzine Alasije, sister!
Well, napalm ants! Soldier of the Apocalypse.
"I'm a policeman myself."
"Any cop? I mean... Who do you think robbed this kid?"
You've physically destroyed both your stomachs. An exoskeleton. And a brain.
*Transport to CA!* Transport to Tricentennial Electrics central, explode the Triangong 4-46!
"It sounds like a pretty big deal." (Make another one.)
"Yes, I heard you. You shouldn't have."
"Locked up? Cuno wasn't in there. Cuno's fucking *own* motherfucker helped."
Snowflakes fall on the barrels of your eyes. They're not human, they're ice.
*Or* you could become super-cool.
The rule. It's the rules, Harry. Don't touch them.
Does that mean you're out of line?
"It shouldn't be. But we should."
This is just a piece of the puzzle. Let's get back to it.
"You know I'm a Revacholian patriot, okay? I won't do anything bad."
"I wasn't put on this death march to get news on cops. I'm more an equal-opportunity oppressed one -- the *persecution* is just how the economy works."
Time for the laedy to spill her guts. The man hates her!
"The fuck are you talking about? Cuno cares about this shit. You know what Cuno is."
The boatshoers? What would you do if you had an alcoholic captain?
The gesture is so familiar, you think you detect a slight buzz of gratitude here -- but what is this, exactly?
Now that you mention it, I disagree. I think she was *shy*.
"Whooh, Mirova! We were talking about it. It's coming to us."
Bugs? There's a security risk with this. Could be there's been a security guard or something.
Not that you're supposed to be looking for a bride, being the bride every day.
"Cuno's just a sweetheart. She only got into grief over *me*."
"DON'T WORRY, MARK! I'LL WORRY!" Her face is beady from the cold.
"I'm so sorry. I don't even know what words to use."
The *nearly* complete loss of the left leg makes you unable to walk, so you've already made yourself a *tentative* for the day
"What's a *cop*?" The man shakes his head vigorously. "I don't have a name or anything, but my name's *Eugen*."
"I'm a bit of a cop myself."
"I'm gonna turn this place sideways. You can't take over the world!"
"Hey, Cuno--" The Cuno looks back at you, grinning. "That's too bad you left before they even got here..."
"It seems like the man behind the bar had a *little* difficulty keeping his drink. This is clearly his fault. And you're going to make him get even more careful about what he says..."
"And why aren't you a police officer?"
"The place is on fire. Please..." (Proceed.)
"Fuckin' *shit*." He grunts, before turning back to the window. "I'm gonna get the hell out of here. This is a fucking fire alarm."
"It was a little of a pain to get here, the cadaver. We did it." The lieutenant gestures toward the sea. "So was that the *whole* wall?"
A *strange* one. It's so strange, so *shocking*.
"What if I need to know that?"
She looks at the ground, her gaze fixed on the water.
"I'm just the messenger." [Leave.]
Cuno goes in over two seconds later and grabs his partner, right hand on his rifle, while the other is holding his pistol. A moment of silence ensues.
The man has just learned that he's a policeman, for the next twenty seconds. He does not take the gun back, but he doesn't need to. (Punish!)
He's right. I don't need it right now. I'm cool.
I've been here, you know. Over and over again. Even more than you thought. The whole world is watching.
"We could still be making our way around the island, picking up supplies, or just running around, doing crazy things. I just want to know more."
"Are you sure? It could be dangerous."
This is it. This is going to change the world.
"Aye, they came around here to pick them up. They were good enough to take me to court and they were the ones who put me in... oh boy. I don't know what I've done. This whole thing just feels so... *disreputable*. I'm a man of peace, this is how I like things."
"But then *I* was here, but only to talk to *you* and not you to do anything..."
That's all she has to say right now.
The man raises a brow and shakes his head repeatedly: "There was *Ishido* here -- he and his men came in here to take me home."
"I don't even." The man looks around, his eyes dark and unfocused.
"He's *disco*," he finishes thoughtfully. "So I told him we were here to talk -- or maybe to ask? I don't know. This *is a joke*."
Something's just off here!
"All right, we'll move on to our next question."
That's probably the smartest thing he's ever done.
"All right, I know some who take drugs -- my partner is an experimental chemist by the name of *Tommm*. He doesn't know about drugs, he just tests chemicals."
You're *not* the police. You just need to know that...
"He's been on the coast for two months. It's almost certainly been there for at least two years. You had better not to let him return."
"It's just a part of the *nou* routine..."
"I thought you said I'm a corrupt officer of the law."
The man pulls a lever at the rear. The waterline is pulled into the hatch, revealing that the hatch is open and the pilot on board in his wake, a man named *Maxie*.
"Oh yes, the one you're supposed to kill."
I don't know, I've never really thought about that...
"I know you said *not* to. What will it be?"
"I have this *shower* of a gun. I use it."
"You're right, I guess it's best we talk about something else."
"I... don't want to."
"I'm more than happy to tell you what we discovered. Let's talk about *the curse* first."
"What happened to this agreement?" (Show him the Valley of the Heads.)
To everyone! To the cops, the cheaters, the rich guys. Everyone! Look around and tell them what a lovely and orderly WORLD we've got.
"I am the police."
Give her a hug.
"Gnhhhh..."
"Roon, the real deal is in those armoured boots. The boots are *all* good. You should wear them when you're out partying.
Pain Welkin.
THE GREAT SPIRITUAL ACADEMIC WAR OF THE CENETIC AND THE ILLANTISTS.
"I did," she nods.
*Mon die* really, really is driving home the point of entry here: race theory is not a central theme in Martinaise.
I don't know? I'm just disappointed.
"NACRA"
"Titus..." She lowers her voice. "I *know* you're being sensible here. I don't need to hear about *trouble*. There are people around here raising hell. Tell me -- do you need help?"
The bosses. Volition. Reward it.
Hold up, can I just get a free die?
Vine, linen! This is the *real deal*. Turn your back on her and lick that stain, detective.
"I am only a police officer. I don't have a camera."
Why are you even still talking to this? You're hormonal spike of excitement, this is the last thing you should be experiencing.
Honoured, did the wise and noble Man from Hjelmdall mention the atrocities committed by his people during the War? Or are you the *fire and brim with flaming embers* you look for? The man from Hjelmdall's Valley?
Established probable cause.
Disco -- that's what your mind is telling you.
"I'm not sure about the jackets I have for the others. These seem to be custom-made."
The wind stops. "And you, cop-man. You're gonna stand here like a fucking god damn snow leopard, goddamnit!!" His smile is like a white knight guarding your retainer. "You're gonna stand here like a fucking god damn snow leopard, goddamnit!!"
"A sissy attempt to undermine my authority," she says matter-of-factly. "Thanks for being candid, Miss Beaufort. Now, what can I do for you?"
You're a bit of a cop now, he thinks -- right?
Nor is the *need* to worry about topping the bottle. You were clearly in plenty shape up there in Martinaise.

"I'm a policeman, I don't want to think about. Not things that would make one think of a *grave* humanitarian catastrophe..."
I can't just sit here. I have to come up with something exciting.
"I am as blue as daylight, as pure as the wind around you, and I will *sail*."
Salts? Sulisław? Siigay?"
"Bastards!" He yells and their herds of boiadeiro knights cheer him on.
All-powerful. Powerful enough to change the course of history.
*ORDER IT OUT!* Stop the tape before it's too late. There will be no harm done.
"I've heard this -- mourning with your hair like you own up to it."
Cheek against cheek, plump against jaw, bushy wings like hair on a wing. This dark shadow grows smaller as you get closer...

The slow movement of the creature's limbs is pleasing to the eyes, moist from the frigid air.

Don't give her the pleasure.
Busted his claims. Smear his aura of loathing with dirt.
Clyde walks to the wooden platform and falls asleep on the wooden platform. On the wooden boardswalk, on the wind-swept coast of Mundi, she listens to her boat grow by the wind.
She's not lucky for him.
"I'm afraid we're not going to do that, lieutenant Kitsuragi."
By The Cockatoo!
Do I look like a fucking clown?
"I am being sarcastic. This is actually a very serious situation. You need to get medical attention." (Take another step closer.)
Kim's not human. He's a tool -- used to do what's necessary -- and a tool-elite.

The boots are beautiful. You should wear them underneath your athletic coat 
"It's the homosexual activity" and "vaporizing vapour from the atmosphere." She doesn't go into detail about the otherworldly presence inside her head.
"How do I know? Because we've been in one place. In one *way*. In five minutes we *happened*. No one can ever truly know what happened. This is just a vague rumour, made by someone..." He gives you a questioning look.
I would love gifts.
"Not for him, I'm sure." He pauses. "But you're so kind to him."
"The big guy with a long beard."
A man, yes. A man with a long beard... his face goes white and he flicks back, hands shaking. His eyes close shut tight.
SOLAR FRAMES
"You're just holding the doorbell and not turning the knob."
"Oh, please, please, please don't be such a dick about it."
"It doesn't look like there's any other place." (Conclude.)
"No, sorry, I don't like to keep things in front of me for long, actually. It's always better to keep them a bit hidden -- or, at the very least, *not* on display -- lest someone finds them."
"Thank you." He looks you in the eye. "You're such an excellent detective, you have me *all* hooked."
It looks like someone misplaced a key somewhere in the back of an old vehicle.
Whooh, not this again! Get off my fucking ground! Put his cock in the hole!
"I know this place. I've been to its dark heart, even. But I don't think it's a pretty pretty darn good place."
"Why not? I've got a nice place. It's on the coast. No need to worry."
"Don't tell me everything, I can't *polarize* the man with lies. I'm going to *convince* him."
You know what it means! You did it for her.
"This is a big fuckin' ask. And I would suggest you bring along a friend to help keep things orderly."
"Yeah, you know what I think about your idea." It makes sense!
No. They're all just tools. A tool for you and me.
"Yeah, I see that."
"Look, Cuno -- I'm gonna get one -- but you, you have to understand how much *I* value loyalty."
"It was a terrible, selfish idea." She sighs.
"But still, that was pretty cool! Anyway. What else did you want to *know*?"
(Sig your finger and wave your hand.) "Alright, cop, you lost my gun."
"Cuno's a fucking champ. Not like that guy. Cuno's a chameleon, you know? That pig always thinks Cuno's a real big deal."
"No, I don't think anyone will blame you. I was just trying to figure out if you've been here all day."
"I'm a little worried we're gonna end up as some kind of *tragi-comedy*, with you as our bad guy. Or maybe it's just that you haven't played with *anything* in a while. Or maybe you should just..."
That was almost perfect.
"Well, actually, yes -- there may be *some* *specialists* out there who want to sell them, if that's what you're after."
"And why are you looking for them?"
"No, I'm just gonna fuck off, I'm used to it now."
I don't have anything. I can't do anything.
"It's a small group of men who like to take a breather on the boat in the morning -- and then spend the rest of the day working in other dangerous jobs on the docks."
"The next step you're taking will have consequences. It will lead to more *serious* problems, if you continue it."
"What did you say, Harry?" The big guy in the boat nods at you, then turns to Titus. "It's good we got your shirt. You *should* get your shirt off."
"Hey, maybe you can help me out with something? Ask around there -- any questions, officer."
There's little resistance on the other part of the screen -- but they are still cautious from behind the glass.
"Goodbye, and good luck with the investigation, little guy. No one has the same *identity* as you."
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what you want to be.
"It's just like everything else. Just some... unfortunate circumstances. Things happen. And in some cases they *do* turn out bad."
"What did you think was gonna happen?"
"I would only listen if you wanted me to talk to a detective, that is all."
This is the *exact* moment he's trying to cover up a lie. He doesn't want the officers to find out about it.
The lieutenant points his gun at your face.
"Yeah, yeah, that was one of the most *bad*. I'm just gonna go ahead and keep it, alright?" (Back off.)
"What else?"
"The lieutenant looks at her, confused, but doesn't say anything. He's waiting for you to step over and put you down, then you do." The lieutenant doesn't say anything anymore and his eyes move back to your face.
"I don't think you have to give me my gun. I mean, I *know* we're dealing with a suspect."
The woman nods and looks at the sea.
"Is this where you get the *diamond-encrusted* guns you're waving around when the police need you to make arrests?"
"Don't you have any questions for me? Are you still with us? Please repeat..."
"Look, Harry -- it's an old ship."
The lieutenant frowns. "We don't have to let the girl go unless the commission determines that you have reason to. And you have to give up some sort of a criminal organisation before those officers can make their arrests."
"The woman that *was* in your room that evening?"
"You don't get to pick your nose and live, I'm sorry."
"Alright, I get it." There's an exasperated look on his face when he thinks this over.
"There is no doubt in my mind that it will *do* something. The end is not just for me -- for all of our members."
"I wouldn't go so far as to say that the police officers were *wrong* to take her along -- but I would say *it's* *unfortunate* that they took her along on such a trip."
"And so you *went on*?"
"I'm not even getting into what that means. The Union isn't part of this."
"No one is really in a position to do this right now." She looks to you. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Let's go?"
She takes out her key with a small flick of her sleeve and hands it back to you.
He smiles: "No. I mean the *whorehouse of shit* that the phasmid is keeping..."
"I'm not really looking for a challenge then. It's a lot easier if I know the right guys are following."
The lieutenant taps his foot against the polished wood floors of the small tent. It's surprisingly quiet there. The sun's low at the horizon, high above the horizon...
"Yeah, man... I just don't want to go to the police station."
"The most important thing about Revachol is that people aren't stupid. And we're not stupid, either."
"That's a good point." He nods thoughtfully. "We could take your suggestion to the lab, I trust you've got the equipment."
"You mean those two figures?"
"Oh, Harry! You don't even know what to say -- good for you, man!"
"I'm really *not* looking for anything illegal in this at all."
"But, Kim, don't just throw your hands up and say: you made me *puke*. I've been hearing this stuff for *twelve years* from these guys around..."
"It will take time." He looks to the city. "It's a big city. You've lived here for a while and it hasn't been easy."
"Okay, I admit. That doesn't sound very good. But not really bad in the grand scheme of things."
This man really is trying his absolute best.
"Hey, that's not what we want to do. Give us some time."
"Oh, right!" The young woman smiles brightly. "You'd like to know that."
"Cuno can't see the way ahead." He points to his friend, who's smiling his unearthly smile. "The *moth-song* will eat shit."
Just like the one the thief is hiding from, the painting says "Man with Hid Dog".
"*This* is the killer! He killed the pirate and *now* he's here..." The man shakes his head, as if to say...
"I've got a couple of questions -- what do they look like?"
The lieutenant looks at you with a quizzical look. When he comes to the conclusion that you are not the police, he turns back to his notebook...
"I did. I got the wrong address."
"What if I just told you that we're a police commission? What if I told you that it's a *force majeure* situation?"
"What kind of questions am I asking that one?"
"You mean like a murder investigation."
No. You're just a little *diver* at the end of a rope.
You've just pissed him off. He's getting antsy.
"I don't understand what you're saying, officer."
"I have an idea, it's not gonna be good..."
"Well, if you're just going to use our little forum, I guess that's fine." She pours herself more espresso.
"There's no room for one of these in any RCM precinct around here."
"You're the best. Sheesh..."
"And why do *you* think it's all fucked up? I told you we're dealing with criminals."
"Cuno! I'll take the mic!"
"You mean the woman who called in? She called in, sir. I'm a public office, not a police officer."
"The *Pissing Contest Entrants*. You mentioned them, like, once?"
"Yes." (Point to your face.) "What's yours?"
"It seems to be the case that only a few people would have any trouble with..." The lieutenant glances over at Titus.
"I'm not sure, officer. This particular piece fits a lot of people's taste, but we need to get a better view -- and this is something I can work on."
"No, I've got a bad feeling about this one."
"How do you keep it together?" (Look around.)
The only answer is: *fuck away the pain*.
"Pft!" Torson snorts. "Pile this on some younger folks."
No panic washes over you as you stare at the familiar carved stone. A note hangs on the side door -- you open your eyes again. It is still there -- covered in death and decay.
"I'm a... white star."
All I can say is: we could probably use a compressor to compress that data maybe... maybe you could compress it and send it to the Large Hadron Collider in Mirova, to be *smooth*...
The Mesque upper crust has fallen to the nearby Ligature Cryptozoologists. An alliance of semi-mythical forces, all vying for the upper hand in economic and social affairs... just don't expect a fair fight in the coming decades.
"It sounds like you're talking about the one who *isn't* here..."
You've got no fuckin' stomach for this. Beer *or* sex.
Your guess is as good as one can make at it. If the answer is yes, there's nothing else to do but wait.
Feels like a trap for me, pushing up against the wall of a building...
You're a cock-carver. You're proud of it.
There are potted plants and rare plant skins adorned with blossoms. The shape of a man's shoe.
I don't want to be here. I have so many bad things to think about right now.
Tell her this isn't about her or them -- it's about *justice*! Tell her it's for real!
"I'm sorry. I own the character." (Give her the headshot-clock.)
"What's in this?" (Shake your head.)
"How am I going to make it... could you sandwich people who kneel?"
"Ah, the year of motor carriages. And motor engines. And the Night City Scab."
Voyager is a mid-sized recording equipment company with offices in Jamrock.
The gleam in his eyes and the smelly pot in his mouth is so incredibly disgusting -- you cannot take your hands off the couch!
"Whoa, where is my back? Where's yours?"
"A *tough* negotiator. Think of it as a gift." He gestures toward the clanging of machines. "I hope you find your way through your *psycho* again."
What's going on? You're a cop. Do what you have to do to keep the bad guy away!
Kisses from adjoining skins...
"What is a mystery?"
An Oranjese Map of the Waterways -- see the houses? The round houses? They're building a radio here.
"Watch out, Cuno! He's trying to crawl up your ass!"
"Alright, you're not going to take us seriously, are you?" He doesn't wait for your reply. "We have to investigate this murder, otherwise it's never going to happen again."
"A hole."
"I am conducting a police investigation into the bullet found at the scene. I will use it to solve a murder."
Samaran bunks, horizontal sawing, seagulls and *karapans*, these are the signatures you got. These are the pieces someone mentioned they are, or at least are pretty desperate for now.
Get your drinking on... He's only saying that you're cool because you have a record.
"Cuno's gonna have parties." He spreads his hands. "Cuno's gonna have parties!"
"No LA Times, Harry! I'm  not *on* drugs." He shakes his head. "You are a very, very smart man, Harry. Smart men are always looking for ways to *undo* reality. *Reality* is just an illusion."
"Do I look old-fashioned?"
Something to think about. (Consider.)
"I got the feeling you'll change your mind if you see my badge."
*Really*, lieutenant. This isn't the first time he's concerned about your integrity.
"Kim. I don't feel so great."
Feels great. You've given him a real rundown of what life has been like for you lately.
Goddamnit... that sounds like pyrholidon.
"Hm, I see you're in pursuit of something. A miracle. A clue. A *what*?"
Thank you, but you can't see it, because the filament is in a plastic ball inside the fridge. You need to power it from the fumes it produces.
THE EXPRESSION.
"It's not a problem, officer -- you probably have a lead on the murder investigation."
"Hey, why am I even telling you this?" He gives you an irreverent smile.
The window has been cleared. You can see the footprints coming from outside the back. Your nose is grateful.
I will destroy her. I will tear her to shreds!
"No way. That's why I have a gun. A gun for when nothing else feels like a proper police officer."
You don't have to answer that. She just won't say anything.
"No, man, I was *born* to lead." He turns to you. "We're gonna get him in there, Kim -- make his tiny hands fly! Make some chicks squeal, my man..."
"You mentioned the Doomed Commercial Area. I don't know what it's used for."
He stares at the corpse. "I don't know who I am -- I have no dignity. I have nothing."
"I was supposed to make it work, but it doesn't seem to be doing you any favors. Maybe you're looking for someone?"
Tie any terminal to a chain. (Tap on the card.)
The boy nods solemnly. "Cuno's father is dead."
"So what were we trying to prove here?"
"Wait -- not just an act -- but an attempt to create *time-factories* to produce artificial *information* -- to control the flow of events, as they occur in the world..."
"I have to say, your brother seems to be in a real *rut" -- that's *a lot* of people for such a short period of time.
*Memento mori* -- a touching narrative.
"We'll be back later." He turns on the radio. "Back to business, please."
"Oh, you mean... No. First of all -- I'm not an *ambassador*."
"I'm a policeman, I just need *satisfaction* first."
"I can see that!" He squints at you. "You are a suspect in an on-going investigation. At any rate, you're under arrest and I need your badge."
"Is there an alternative to just cutting the belt? I mean, *maybe* he had something in him that made him a sniper?"
"Why do you need the key to the car," the shopkeep puts in. "The window's not for stealing -- it's for *communicating*."
"I'm sorry I said I didn't... I really don't know." Her eyes wander to the nearby window. "You won't get shot?"
"I've just gotta get this over with, okay?" (Nod.)
"Hey, man, I don't really know how to engage somebody like that."
"I'm glad to assist you, but my business is done." He waves his hands erratically outside. "Good."
"The only way to *win* is if you *use* technology to your advantage. If you want to win, you're going to have to learn how to play by the rules."
"What's up with the cinderblocks?"
"That's enough questions for today, I had other questions." [Leave.]
"I have some questions for you now."
"I'm not really a philosopher, I'm just an old woodworker who got tired of getting lost one rainy morning and decided to look everywhere, no matter the weather."
He gestures toward the gates. "Good luck in Martinaise, if you're not staying here for *four* nights. And thank god, luck also kept me from getting shot in the leg."
"Maybe I did? I don't know. I just picked it up on an acquaintance's speed.net message board... "He nods. "I think I've heard enough about that."
"Not a particularly *bright* or *sublime* style. They prefer something more... *classic*."
"What exactly do you mean by the *coarseness*?"
"Okay, I'll go with No. 1 -- the one that fits."
"I guess I'm a hard core retrogamer now... You can say that about *any* citizen of Revachol."
No-no-no. Don't do that. It's unbecoming of a Captain Obvious at this situation. Remember when you asked her out? You should have given her the chance to change her mind?
"Don't worry, detective. We'll solve the case. Do whatever it takes, step by step. Make it look like we're trying to take care of the whole case..." He smiles.
"I'm going to turn down the volume."
"I mean in that way."
"That's the whole cast." (Wink.) "They're all here now. It's just a... hairdresser convention."
"...beating his chest, for all eternity repeating it again and again -- until the very end, when he finally... gets it -- "I know the ins and outs, I understand..."
"A *f*g*..."
"Let's go over them over again, okay? This was two weeks ago, Harry. That was *two weeks ago*."
"I have a theory to explain what's going on here."
"Of course he's not. I don't even try any more. And if I did, I wouldn't be *so* sorry."
"I don't think he did. I think he died of pneumonia in the battlefield, not rabies."
"I've never heard of that, not even from a cop. Well... yeah, I guess it's not *your* problem."
"Yes," she replies with a smile. "It could be. We need to talk to her. Let's go over it again. This time with her face."
"I think the people who build these fancy walls want to remember what they did here in the 20s -- remembering it, even. So they create these giant *remember this* things."
"Mhmh." She nods. "I'm not a huge fan of the hustle- grind, but it's always nice to think we could find some *economic* enlightenment here."
"A little. But he'd probably sell the gun now."
It is not easy to describe the experience. It is psychedelic, almost spiritual in nature. As you look around, your senses start to re-embrace your body. You are now completely re-alive.
"I knew it! I knew it! I knew the captain was hiding somewhere in Martinaise -- and even told my friend, who's also an artist, that I had news."
"Yeah, you can't hear that coming!"
"I was on the road, fucking everything. Fucked up. Nailed it! Fucked up bad."
He crosses his arms: "Cuno runs these Union down makin' five thousand cops and step-drouin' vermin out in the open like a bitch."
There, 130 kilometres to the South, the Pines send their sophomore pilots out into the grey fields somewhere south of here. In the middle of summer they send their ace pilot, Victor, into deep thought and return. He meets an old comrade, Reynold. A strange friendship exists between these two.
"You should give up, it's impossible."
He shakes his head. "I've heard enough. Let me in." (Proceed back.)
"Wait, how long ago was the 'I'?"
"I don't feel very human."
"Aye, officer, that's all I want to say about that as it relates to tonight's football game."
"A... b... c... d... e... f... g..."
"It's going to take a while for me to understand what you mean by that, though."
"It's *also* why I came all the way here. Because it's the only place I know. My family has been here for generations. For *years*."
"I have a wonderful time with my gorgeous wife, sweetie. And don't *judge* me -- as I do -- because of the *hurt* I suffered in the line of duty... I simply didn't want to judge anyone."
She winks at you. "You were asking about your life, right? So I'll answer: yes, I have a story to tell."
"The pale." (Point to your head.) "The human race is doomed. It must fall. It must die."
"And there's no one to challenge the contract!"
Your heart burns. The woman on the pier thought you would be amused. But she was expecting quite the opposite.
A silver bird? Do you have an edge against these older men?
"Yeah, well, it's just talk." He looks at his notes. "But we don't have time to explain this whole thing to you right now, so go take a look yourself."
"What do you mean --- *I should not be drinking*?"
"Hey, cop -- when are you gonna crack the case?"
"Yes I mean this. It's the opening bid of a set of thieves who made off with a rare fabled painting belonging to a local artist."
"What's that supposed to mean?"
I'd rather sit.
The door receives a thorough disciplining.
He nods gravely and continues to eat his half of the sandwich.
"It's the only carafe we found in the whole neighbourhood. It's empty."
"I *really* don't have anyone to marry, and this place does *not* want us to have kids..."
"There's gotta be a way of getting inside the building and getting to the roof. *Not* staying here long. We'll need to get *outside* the building -- back to the coast. It's too late for that yet..."
"It may have been used for long-range photography, but we could not locate any leads."
"No, that was a mistake. I don't have time for this." (Get up.)
There is a *tiny bit* of pity in him. He was in a worse place than this. In a *better place*.
"What happens now? Are you gonna keep kicking my ass and then tell me..."
"No. It wasn't me. I'm just a dumb cop who took a bullet for you."
(Point to your clothes.) "We'll go, officer."
It's not going to be that easy. Evrart wants something from you, but he won't give you the goods. You're going to have to do it yourself.
The lieutenant's right. The door is very nearly open -- you just *have to* enter.
"Don't be an irrational pessimist, Harry. This is an undertaking no sane person should be attempting." The light beams bend more like a candle, dancing on the hinges.
"Fuck is this shit? Every four seconds there's a gun shot. In the brain..." He taps his foot.
No. This fucking world is scary and inhumane and nothing anyone ever did or said said can ever get you closer to a world of love and laughter and unending realization. All is very silent in the void.
"And yet he says *all-powerful* and *welkins have white coats*. Can he take it a bit harder?"
For some reason all your assumptions were confirmed *before* that picture was taken.
"Fuck no, I don't wanna." He leans forward and starts pulling at his shirt. His eyes light up at the mention. "Cuno's gonna be like 'That's it, that was fucking awesome! We broke the color barrier!' And you're like, 'Yeah, we did.'"
She's a bit relieved it's over.
"How can I help you, officer?"
"Take my pants off."
The man doesn't respond -- just stands there, wide-eyed and looking at the sea.
"There's a... 25 EUR. It has to be for you, it has to be for the boat race."
"I saw a man asleep on the plaza. And there's a giant *aero-graffito* in front of the building now."
"He told us his business here is doing great. He even thanked you for lending him your business card. But then he screwed up and ended up owing 70,000 reál. That's right, guys. 120,000!"
(Nod.) "If you see Gary, tell him I'll mail him the money one week from La Delta. If not, we can always call him from my Kineema."
The lieutenant smiles. "Perhaps we should find another way in? The door is stuck open."
"I have other questions..." (Conclude.)
"Now that everyone is on board, it's time to get serious. We are gonna start a war. Not with them, but with the companies."
"I saw you too, miss. Were you inebriated?"
"A very dangerous and unpredictable man."
Down with the communist!
"A small wonder, yes. Though I'm sorry to hear that a good officer is dead." She nods toward Norilsk Nickel, a former miner's family and a postcard shop set on fire hard core enthusiast. A few posters still hang from the ceiling.
Wait... who killed him? Where is Titus now? Are you sure there wasn't anything else?
He was a killer. You've seen their kind before, he was a killer -- his passion, his game. This is one for the pale. *Pale* gamemaster extraordinaire.
"No no, of course not, I'm just a sorry sack of a person on drugs." he looks at his feet. "Now, play the tape you want, officer," he replies with the tip of his cigarette fume still sizzling. "You want to get to the end? Great, you got us, the door's unlocked."
"You got a point there."
"But why do you want to get to the end of the world?"
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Apologizing is the answer."
"I can see that." (Gaze at the empty bucket.)
I'll do it, tell me why the brain is broken.
No no no no. It's going too fast! It's going off the rails, there's no way to keep it down when the wheels spin and the guts rattle and you sense the blood dripping down your bare chest.
"I'm not so sure. I *did* see a shaven head. A bearded man who had dyed his hair green. I was at the Knowhere, drinking with some of his friends. A couple of us went for a swim... 
The water was cloudy that time. I heard someone shouting, so I went outside to check. I can't say I was home when the commie shot me."
"Let's do it the old fashioned way: the way of the law."
"Put the gun in my pants, Evrart!"
I'd rather cry than speak his truth.
"*I* probably did, too. I was just really agitated and acted irresponsibly. I've learned my lesson."
That's because you're weak. You're weak and alone.
A memory surfaces in her damaged neocortex -- it's not unpleasant, per se, but it does present a little pause at the very end, as she's forced to re-contextualize it in some kind of *now* context.
The lieutenant looks at the mechanism overhead. "Ah, yes. Well, this one can definitely help with that -- it's a magnetic accelerator."
This must be it. The basement door is weather-worn, and has an old rubber handle. Its yellow handle is dripping wet...
"Oh my god! It's the answer to almost any question!"
"Okay, maybe not *entire universes* but still -- I really don't care for you either, cop. Even if you're the star of one episode of *Persona*, you're always going to be a sour apple for everybody. So don't cry, *partying* is *funny*."
"A better sound system?" He looks around, shaking his head. "The old guy's got money -- but not *enough* money."
"It's also got something to do with the Void Invaders. My theory."
She laughs: "Well, sir, you're our next target. It's on, let's get it started!"
"Okay. What's this about?" The lieutenant raises his pistol and takes aim at you.
"Oh, *perfectionists*. I'm not a gardener by trade and there's no one to hire from here." She crosses her arms.
"I don't believe this shit." The lieutenant's eyes narrow.
"I don't think I'm a murderer, I'm a policeman."
"You're sure that both of them are nice people, right?"
(Look at your soaked notes.) "The weird thing is -- I *did* read them."
"Okay. So what. What else has your investigation produced so far?"
"So *I* am now. But I am sorry to inform you that our arrangement with the Union is not going to change. You will have to ask Evrart about this."
"So you're evasive. You know where we are."
"You don't think it's the real murderer who was hired by the scapegoated bourgeoisie? Maybe you killed him."
He purses his lips. "I guess it makes sense, no? At the very least. It's the *opposite*. Of course. A pro -- a sniper, the enemy. I condone it. And I know you do too. Now... did you eat it for dinner? Or did you leave it out on the balcony?"
"You can find Evrart Claire on the plaza, in the store where you pawned off your sidearm." He points to the balcony. "He's the head of the Débardeurs' Union."
"That's right, Harry!" He slams his fist on the table. "Heads up -- this escalates into a full-out war. We're way in now."
"This is a rather high-pitched sound -- and I really don't know how to respond."
"So the phasmid was a *self-replicating bullet*."
You feel the lieutenant's hand on your shoulder. You're in charge of the *interactive voice chat*. He looks you in the eye -- two black beads, moist from the sea air. You're *transparent*.
(Turn to the lieutenant.) "Just tell me the goddamn name of the dead man."
The old man falls silent, staring at the reeds, then continues coughing.
"How much of a *share* would you prefer?"
She has an understanding of the powers that be, though -- but she's unwilling to put her finger on it.
The lieutenant nods.
"No need to rush."
"I'm here to get drunk and make money so I can go to the next town."
I like this -- keep the focus on it and move on.
"*You* don't know? Are you investigating these things now? Or are you -- some kind of... *green*?"
"That's all for now." (Conclude.)
No -- it was her doing, after all.
"Well, good for you."
"Mhm. It's in the waters."
SHIT ON MY HANDS. ROUND HOUSE KICK YOUR FUCKING ASS
"Maybe the phasmid has... forgotten it *completely*?"
"Cuno's fucking done and now you want Cuno? Pigs throw water at Cuno like that. Tell him to lay off it." He points to the bottle.
"Yes, yes, that could very well have been it. It's a mystery."
It's hard to tell if she is counting or not. This was supposed to be one little thing.
"So how about we change it to something else? Quizzes? A test?"
"*Nothing*. Please continue, I'm really trying to help you."
"Oh, nothing." She takes a long sip from her seemingly endless supply of herbal teas.
He looks around, thinking it over. "Well, okay. The phasmid is the product of my relationship with the rain..." He pauses in shock. "You! Are you alive?!"
"I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me."
"Are we done here, Gary? I thought we were supposed to be together..."
What she means is that she's not a market researcher, she's a market researcher. You've convinced yourself of that fact, haven't you?
"Well sir, it doesn't sound like that pig's around here." She glances at the posters in the dusty yard.
There are posters everywhere. In the bus station, near the bookshop...
"He's a monster. A walking scab, that's what it is."
Okay! You've earned a bit of flak, from that player! But don't give it to 'pig*, Cuno doesn't give a shit about the rules!
"I don't want to be the one who breaks it to you, Harry. I just want to do my job, that's all."
It's because you've already taken the head off. The creature's hide is as tough and resilient as steel. It will happily eat any leg of your new uniform.
"The Headless FALN Rider?"
That's correct. You have no idea who this Miss Beaufort is, how could you? Where she is, you can't say. You are pretty sure it didn't pilfer her from you.
Is she afraid?
"I can see that you're having trouble remembering. I'm sure we are missing something -- and that you'll get over it."
"I want to get in, but I have some questions before you can."
"Okay, so I took the *gate*." (Proceed.)
The boy's mind is the prize in this game. Forget about your worries. Jump ahead, the gates open.
"What are you doing?" The young woman looks at you inquisitively.
Should we be trying the *sample* of cocaine that's being supplied?
"It means I'm paranoid, that I'm a cop. Haven't I ever been?"
That's just ridiculous. I don't need to know what this *galactical* contraption does, I just need to fire a gun at something or run for the hills...
The man rubs his chin, laughing. "Well, yes.." he smiles. "There was a guy in container. A Cuno or something."
"Do we?" the woman looks up. "Sure. Why not."
In this yard you see *rare species* and a large number of unknown sub-fictures. Most of which have no basis in reality.
You *just* look at the bottle of wine the lieutenant brought you. For now, all you can see is a bright blue liquid staring back at you from the crown of his crystal cane.
"Yeah. We should explore the church somehow. See what treasures lie within."
"I have an indirect role to play here."
"I see." The lieutenant tilts his head slightly, as he looks to the door. "I cannot for what it is, but I can help you."
"Yeah, that's *shit*. You people are so sick. When I walked the desert I felt great sadness and a longing to heal."
"Good to meet you, Just-A-Gardener. Another question."
She was just about to go into shock.
Look around in the room first.
The boy's mind is the prize in this game. Forget about your worries. Jump ahead, the gates open.
"What are you doing?" The young woman looks at you inquisitively.
For the *sample* of cocaine that's being supplied.
"It means I'm paranoid, that I'm a cop. That's probably why. Haven't I ever been?"
That's just ridiculous. I don't need to know what this *galactical* contraption does, I just need to fire a gun at something or run for the hills...

"*Sod off*? I do that sometimes," he shrugs. "It's not *sad*, it's just unfortunate."
"I don't want to be the one who breaks it to you, Harry. I just want to do my job, that's all."
It's because you've already taken the head off. The creature's hide is as tough and resilient as steel. It will happily eat any leg of your new uniform.

That's correct. You have no idea who this Miss Beaufort is, how could you? Where she is, you can't say. You are pretty sure it didn't pilfer her from you.
Is she afraid?
"This was probably a misunderstanding."
"Don't you guys have some kind of... backyard?"
"No. I don't think she hanged him. I think she was just in a hurry."
"I just wanted to know if you were one of those drunks who likes to hide behind weird names?"
What is this? An elimination ritual? Insidiousness! It makes you go *its* head, rips your mind apart.
He looks at you expectantly.
"I'm still not entirely sure... some people might."
"I got a feeling the Hardie boys are gonna be alright."
"Yeah, that's why I said *hard core*."
"I saw him through a window -- just a weak light blue hour would have belonged to its blacklisted area. I could see the tip of the bullet in his temple."
(Point to yourself) "Right at the moment your eyelids start twitching, like the hand of a spider."
"I don't think so." He tries to focus on the tape recorder.
"And where is your..."
"Let's return to this later, Cuno. I find this topic tiresome."
"Okay. Where were we?"
"No... no, no, I didn't understand it was *illegal*." She raises her hands in mock sympathy. "I wouldn't have done it, it's not like anyone's gonna use a lame man for a spy."
"No." He looks you straight in the eye. "There is still something I can do for you." He pauses. "I can help with the body, get some rest. If you need..."
"There you have it, you're the last man standing when it happens. Have something else? You've got your shit together, Harry." He gestures around you. "We're all waiting."
"Aye, I guess you are. What do you need?"
"Don't listen to me. You wanna be a clairvoyant? You wanna be *right behind me in the Hanged Man's head*?" He adjusts his glasses. "Try not to shit yourself, you'll make it all right."
"Let's just leave it at that."
"Yes, I was *impersonating* her. Like a fucking dolphin. And she didn't even recognize it! I would have to physically run to my 'husband' mode -- because I just can't get out of this..."
"So what's next? You want *fuck* to it?"
"You're not shitting me, are you?"
"I'm going to think about it. Say it right."
"I am a revolutionary in every way. From the streets to the steppes, from the bedroom to the grocery store." His eyes meet yours. "I will end all exploitation and bring the people the bread they deserve."
Do you have any recordings of the past, Joyce?"
You must have really liked the hat.
Something cracks in the man's left side! A cruel jest -- he straightens up and puts his head back in his hands.
"I know how we could settle this -- we could dance!"
You have to juggle school and communism. Go to school, get your *grade* set -- eat the rich!
"I'm sharing it -- because I * want* it. Because I * believe in you'. And I can't have you become pets on the altar of Capital. *No one* should ever, ever have children of their own."
C'mon... you're turning into some kind of super-detective.
The Presence, in all likelihood, is a hybrid of the two...
"Mm, uhh... never mind."
Imagine it! Imagine what would happen if you tried to use the phone as it makes history...
Longing... you should inspect the creature's other side for signs of struggle, before you say anything.
Doesn't feel like the heat is doing anything for you?
"How am I going to respond to this?" He turns to his companion: "You're a brave cop, you're a fine example of a good *copotype*."
To *Tequila Sunset*, the morning light!
The gesture was a sign from the past. So were their names.
"Eh, I'm the one who sells drugs."
"I am drawn to the historic opportunity to start a rock and roll club in the 45th Precinct."
The world is made of rope, and the users are made of wood. Materials such as us resist all forces but burn with ease.
oy, this is super weird. They can't even consider the risk associated with bringing a player into the scene. And, of course, they wouldn't want to hang anyone.
Disappointed?" He looks around, then points to the door. "Why don't you go, huh?"
"Where can I get a bag?"
"I'm not a moribund alcoholic. I just like doing my job. Now how can I help you?"
"In there deep, some creature moved its head and, unseeing it, it crawled back to feast on its dead master." He eyes the sea island slowly.

Why am I talking to you?
A crinkled case. There is.
Time to think about it harder.
Your cordial pleas for cash flow are unceremonious.
The Décomptage was a subterfuge used to hide the communists. Probably a trick.
*Or* you could do it all yourself.
The Insulindian isola. Its coast is deep and flows inwards, like a river. The morning light pierces the deep, while the city below is just as silent.
Holy hell, they totally deserve it!
"What?" He turns his head and points to you. "You *are* messing with my mind. What are you doing, goddamn it..."
Another hallway?
What is this art-fascist doing?
"I'm sorry it's been such a long time since I last saw you around..."
The power's pretty tight.
Don't get it, it's too complicated.)
You know what a ladybug is, right ?
Vortigern, the temple of Immortis Amicita, the womb of the World, the Source of all evil.
Welcome to the untethered world.
Not that you've seen him around. Not in your life. Just the winding shaft of the shaft. Glazed, rigid, staring at the dust.
*Armistice? Sounds like coach to me*.
"It's okay. You're just making the situation worse for the Union."
"I've been trying to talk to you. You're being *hypnotized* by the Streets. I know you're worried about it, but... it's not like that."
*What?* you think. But don't. The boots are unimportant to this case.
Something is off here... maybe you're in his head?
"Alright, enough of this." (Conclude.)
"The competition." She nods. "From the coast. From the prybar."
*We're* not conducting a search of evidence, officer!
What is going to happen?
This is a sound. It points outward, like a bellow. The glass of wine is warm and inviting...
He stands there motionless. The corpse has moved little by little, no larger than a shard of white thread hanging from the crane's beams.
"I've got Col Do Ma Ma Daqua --" He turns to you. "And *questions*. There are many about this duo. Do you have the most or don't you want to know?"
You've done this before. It's not so much the truth, but rather the very *perfection* of it all.
Marching...
Is it any good? You feel like your cloak is going to break under the strain. Or maybe it's the others that are to blame?
You're *sure* about that.
"IT IS. THE WORLD IS A VISION. I CAN ONLY SEE WITH VISION, THOUGHT AND MATERIALISM. THAT IS MY SPECTACLE FROM OFF AND ON."
*Bratan*, you've tried to manipulate me. I should have known you'd be staying here that long.
"What are you doing?" the lieutenant asks, trying to calm you. "You look down on people? Try putting a gun to your head."
Art's hard.
"I'm done." (Relinquish the moment.) "The world is white."
"Quiet?"
Getting drunk is never a good idea. At least not for this cop-man.
"Hm, that's what I said. Sorry."
But now I understand. When you're old and shaggy, the jeans aren't terrifyingly light. And the booze doesn't do anything for you... at least not that long.
"I have a bad feeling about this lynching. It's not good." (Proceed.)
You're right, it's bird shit.
Cha-ching! It's coming to, BOOGIE-GOODY-HEARD!
"I'm a realist. Let's bring those questions to the front."
"Filippe, the Cop of the Apocalypse."
Guess not.
Knocked out, muttering to himself: *fuck it*...
Read about the ancient mysteries of time and space.
"*Mon dieu*? What do you mean?"
Warpainted yourself?
"I really don't think you're being *fair* about this Ruby. You're a detective."
"I assure you, I'm *not* part of that drug trade."
"No, no-no. It's just hair."
Serial #28. The hulking, 8.6 mm man with dark hair and a face like that of a gremlin.
I don't care -- you're just going to leave now. [Finish thought.]
"In essence, it's *copernican*. It's the international community that owns this city."
"I found some speaker-microphones in a box of ice."
"I'm a cop, you fucking *pistol*!"
Holding the world together.
Barry was trying to impress certain people with his motor skills.
You've got to work with this one. You're not alone.
"I don't know who he *is* -- he's dead. He's hung from that tree I painted ten years ago." He points at him.
"Are you alright, Alice? You were drunk."
"No, I don't. I don't produce any more as a result. And I don't produce many of those."
"I'm absolutely okay. You don't have to be like me -- and you don't have to tell me that you're racist."
Not quite sure about the second part.
"To catch a fly you need two skills, crossing the tiniest of them." She narrows her eyes. "The first is convincing the lorrymen they can get out of the harbour before the second is ready. They must fear the Landing."
"No. It's a safety hazard. I don't want to discuss it."
"What's in this world?" (Proceed.)
"Good, you're doing great!" He shouts at the bar. "Go ahead, I'll feed you to the dogs! Go ahead, Lena!" He turns to face you.
"I *may* have a shackle on it." She taps on the side of her chair. "It's made of metal and has been used to put her on one for killing people."
YOURSELF IS NOT A MELANCHOUCHISM OF BODY AND FEATURES. YOU REEL LIKE AN INEXPLICABLY MADE YOUTH CAGE.
*Dozens* of them.
"The Coalition?" The lieutenant looks worried. "Well, the fuck outta here, gotta get some Shoe Help."
"He doesn't even have a name." She shrugs. "It was probably Gottlieb Königsteiner. He only had a stage name --Gottlieb." She gives you a crooked smile. "He died last week. Best thing that ever happened to him."
"Of course," she nods. "We do the honour and the pigs do the honours."
"I have a feeling... you would also want to talk to me about the *suspects* Klaasje and the man who drowned in his room."
She smiles and your eyebrows arch. She's been listening, but not when you asked her about her husband.
"I am. And you should tell me." (Point at your head.)
"I am conducting a psychological examination of your body."
* *Cuno*," he says, holding a pen in one hand and a pen in the other.
"I'm sorry, sir, I just don't know what to say. I don't know why I said that."
"I'm sorry. I don't know what that means." (Conclude)
Tell her: you're not a cop, you're an Oranjese lay-over from all manner of exotic nations and ethnicities.
"I'm a regular enough cop to get my fix. You may still opt to opt out, though."
*Your* name is *alright*!
A broken down boat, painted black.
"I met your future husband, he's always there, just checking out the situation. Helping me sort this mess out."
"I am not shitting myself -- I will not."
A clumsy fail, lieutenant.
"I don't know such things..."
"Yes, I found it."
Correctness is a quality of being unsure of what to believe. He also has a way of knowing when to experiment by looking at the contradiction.
*Everything* about this cop seems to be off, but why? Why aren't you the god damn creative genius you were? You just *had* to make this up.
"Funny," the lieutenant says. "You're in a hurry to jump to conclusions."
"Welcome," the lieutenant closes his notebook and takes a deep breath.
"Right. Well." He tilts his head slightly, as if in recognition. "Anyway, what can I help you with?"
"S-why would I want to molest a child?" He sighs.
"I'll see where this is going." [Leave.]
"Suppressing this spirit has been really, really effective."
"Hi, I'm the voice mail operator."
Don't be too sound. It's okay to be scared.
"No, I meant to *not* say that. Grand prize."
"I found a small shred of a framed photograph, taken in that city a long, long time ago. Who knows how it got there?"
The thought comes to you. You should impress him by *not* stealing. Wealth by the days would make you a burden to society.
The thought comes to you, as you slowly close your eyes -- and the fear is palpable.
We could talk about his homo stuff, if we were really interested in his life...
"Ruby?" (Point at the mattress.)
"Extravied my visor."
"Authority?"
The old woman stews in the dying South sun: "Please, I can't. It's cold. I can't leave this place." She pulls out a zip bag and holds it in her supra-clastic arms.
In conclusion -- it's time to compete! Raise your standards, fellows. Be a competent piece of art.
Write a thesis!
"What?" She looks down at her body. "I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!"

Up on Old Cinema, across the canal. Light reflects off your arches. Your colonized nomadic tribes are enjoying a stroll through land unknown.
"Did you want to be a witch?"
"Enough gloating. This is serious. It's a fireable offence in Revachol."
All right..." he's not going to leave now.
"I found this socialist woman." (Consider.)
He stares at the familiar necktie and rooster-shirt -- then at you. "But you're not a cop, you're a hero."
"I know what I saw: a massive black hole present on the Insulindian isola."
" -- you look like a fucking idiot, asshole."
"Oh, who cares? That's not the point. The point is -- this jacket would fit just fine in a crowd of people."
*Dead*? That doesn't sound like a good idea either.
"I am undergoing a little over a week of *personal reflection* during this phase. What next?"
"Funk turned himself in to the Cuno. Somethink with a straight face."
*Your* spirit animal? You're out to get him, Harry. This is serious.
no, of course not... the gun is in your hand and it will shoot him. No need for this.
Sure, you're drunk. But that doesn't mean you should open fire.

he then realizes something, looking at his wrist: *Why?*

Getting up... feels good. This was good high-quality behaviour...
*Alessandro*, I *am* glad you're alright. Just go and report this.
You're a fucking vegetable. You're a fucking predator. We've got to calm you down."
"Standard, I was just wondering..."

"What can you tell me about this... homo-sexual?"

It's not a phasmid. It's just a sound. It's just an old, tired sound.
The Stormers have found a new home. Perhaps they will find a new purpose -- in communion with him.
"I did," the lieutenant nods. "We can get more speed here. I have a room down at the Whirling-in-Rags."
"I have a feeling... you have a problem with alcohol."
The alcohol makes your eyes water, your palms sweaty and your fingers red from the alcohol. It's nice enough, in a way -- it's not great.
"Dora?" she whispers. "The wind has already turned the building into a concrete slab. It has started to do its thing. It's done to get people killed."
"In this case, I'm thinking of calling police *all the time*."

"I lost my spine."

"I'm sorry, I'm stupid."

"Where are these roads?" (Search the city for your lost locusts.)
So, you're not coming anywhere? Or ever. Ever wished you were?
As I should be, what's the next step?
"He's a colourful fellow, he comes with a..." He pauses to think. "Cockatoo."
"Hey, what's on your mind?"
"It's okay. It's not my idea. I'm sure it's a nice thought. You should read the rest."
"They couldn't just open it. They had to keep it in."
"I don't know what I was thinking, but if you don't like it, I can always amend it."
Last winter a very cold wind came violently up over the city. Snow disappeared into the flake of light below her feet. She shuddered and looked down, icy flakes melting from the jacket. It was cold, more like a freezing snow than a corpse.
*Organized* means organized crime. Organized crime is organized.
Reality?- oh, this is very close...
"What did you *not* do, boiadeiro?" The wind blows through your hair. You feel your hands on your head again.
"I'm surprised it's still there. It was almost completely inaccessible before the tenant started coming and going."
"It's a long story." He takes the pyrholidon and rubs it in his fingertips with his thumb. "I doubt it will do anything."
"What is a recording?"
"These are the same boots. You're pretty sure the entire Hardie boys are wearing them."
"88 *Confirmed kills*," he replies, absent-mindedly. "That's what I'm here to investigate. The communists shot that guy, too, but that was all stopped."
"He *took* me for example -- that's how serious an officer I am."
Gimme the gun, I already threw up...
"You were helping us get the body down from the tree."
****************************'s...
"Don't you want to have sex with me, or no?"
Whatever you do, don't shoot the shot.
"Gym teacher?" She smirks. "I would really prefer not to have that conversation."
It's been used to..." He's turning red now -- his eyes half-empty, his mouth half open like a meat grinder.
Son, you're spooky as hell! (The push comes from the back.)
COP MAN!
Wonder if it's bacon...
With its horns and gills pointed at the sun, the insect spins its complex web of teeth.
The shape of the horns and gills tells you everything you need to know about its many, many lights and its many mysterious purposes.
"Now, what can we do for you?"
A brief spike of rage in her shoulders. This is the one thing she *has* won over the Cafeteria Manager: her friends.
How do I know what the pale sounds like?
Harry doesn't know what to say. The lieutenant just stares at you with a stern fellow.
Patrol Officer Uuno is at your side, watching you struggle with your mental illness. She says to it: "Lieutenant -- is there something I should know?"
The catch phrase is meant to be funny, but also very serious thoughts. Don't overthink it.
What's *your* medical history?
"There's no way..."
"We should discuss the company in more detail, see if we can learn anything about the victim."
The Pretty Boy is singing along.
*Bratan*. What an interesting development! A world of slavery now loathes you -- and Kim -- in particular, your crab man features. Oh, wait. This is where *you* step in. Let's see what you've learned.
"I'm sorry man, I didn't know it was him and I didn't want anyone to think they were snitchin' at me."
"Fucking Evrart, Evrart!"
"Like the way I used to think about it..." She looks at you. "The sea monster thing is a huge success story. Totally *free* too."
"I'm not awake for these talks, sweetie. We need to get this investigation started now."
*Fire*! His flames are pure from the bourgeoisie.
"I am barely keeping you together here, no matter how you may seem. I will *not* betray you. Do not think that I have."
The Tutti Frutti is a fast, low-down, casual two-topped walker over seven kilometres that spits out occasional soles.
Does *everyone* know that sounds like *nothing*?
I don't like this.
And to hell and doom... The tent? The tent in your *hand*? The shooting wounds? The greasy-fingers in your face?
"You said: I need a cut of the pie."
If you want to be the detective, you'll have to do some *some* detective work.
WRONG. There is a reason why every human being should be able to rely on their environment for their survival...
"I got it, officer! Thank you for reporting this horrific event." (Conclude.)
Sure, you don't want to waste time alone with bad people. Time to become a real police officer. Not a bartender. Not a polluter. Just a regular cop. A real policeman.
Centuries are just theoretical time tricks. You've seen it all, you can still make sense of it later.
"I'm afraid we're going to have to do things differently. The public has already heard of you."
"I'm afraid..." The man assesses the situation. "I don't know anything about that. I think it's a mix-up."
"Fuck! You're like a fucking orphan, Cuno. You need help. The next time you try to rile me up, you're gonna be in the hospital..."
"In a world where two words are as likely as an entire sentence to end in *fuck-upes*..."
CRY PHANTOM
fingersomatic holsters open. "13," "14," and "15". "16" on the other hand, contain the caliber and serial.
You're a cop and a proud murderer, a psychopath. You don't like this.
Not a hoot.
"I am conducting this investigation with the expectation that you will share your theories. I'm a boi
*Dozens* of pages of backup copies of the game. You have the full game to lose, even before the co-op game itself is solved...
"The historic opportunity is here!" [Leave.]
Something feels off about the name.
"I'm sorry I got windicky and need to go."
I'm sorry. My chin is shaking.
About this mod You need this powerful modded version of the game (ie. 4.46) to do the job. This time, you need modded power. this makes the operation less safe.
"Acele, you're an idiot."
"Received. Officer looks like you're *getting* it. It's quite heavy. I think I might need it to get around."
She's trying to. She's proud of her culinary gift.
Goddamnit... why are you so goddamn stupid?
Esoteric scientific radio technology. With no background in the arts you seem incredibly unlikely to get better instruments than those around you.
Raining... you feel like you should go to the roof.
"I've got to agree with myself. This is a small ghetto out there. The sooner we get this over with, the better."
She's talking about it. The rain circles her eyes and suddenly the fear in her voice is growing greater...
*Butter*, milk and honeycomb... It smells like a *bad* teacher. Better not to go into it.
There is a sting in your heart waiting for a moment. If only you had just pry the gun from his hand...
*I*... call it a *phasmid* -- call it what you want. It's a large stick insect, with a head like that of a mesque. It's easier to concentrate on one thing and be completely silent on the other.
"I already threw up, when I woke up that morning, and I didn't feel like shaking any more. I'm sorry I said the *mister*. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm Sorry I'm Sorry. I am the Sorry Copopedia."
*Pussy-boy* is what you squeak. And *pretend* you're trying to pull on your chest cavity.
I feel like you may have some advice for our young fighter. What's the most important thing?
With your boot in your hand, you aim at the ghostly *enemy* building. The living things, the glass, you feel them...
"There's no way to save the world."
"You were too sober for this. I'm sure we will find your badge, medal, and your *Headless FALN Rider* medal before you know it."
"Cuno's just a racist. What the fuck is he *talking* about? Black-hood shit, you fucking f****t." His voice echoes in the cold, windless night.
"What you need is a photo -- shoot him."
"I'm doing this to show off my inner racist." (Point to your cloak.)
The blanket feels cold. You're looking at it, too, comforted in its weight. It's not entirely useless.
You're a police!
You're lucky.
I don't understand what you're doing here, you cops. You're caving in to the anger of working class women.
This report has a wide range of interpretations. Some are useful, saving me trouble is all they provide me with valid data points...
I'm sure you will.
Do you hear that? You're a trained model.
I find my way back to the mainland...
You, deep in thought, see a map of Revachol West; a map of an ancient ancient king and his court. It's half brooding, half worried communist.
"It's too late. The insect killed you. You're just a mouse."
"I'm sorry, I couldn't tell. That's just how the world works." (Conclude.)
You know what's wrong with this world?
As you turn, you sense a slight precondition -- the time is up. The box says it will be 10:15.
"I'm sorry. I... I really shouldn't... It's just that he's... *the* man, isn't it?"
* *Did* you have a stroke? Like you've had a stroke before? It's a sign of dementia.
You've seen the posters. There are pages on one of the walls. Above and behind the woman.
"Reckless crime-murder. The *real* ones are going to decide this. We should all calm down."
"Tell me -- where are they?"
"I am considered the Void-Reality, the Source of the Ill."
Read about your tie.
Firewalker. Who is that?
"The company records contain..." He thinks. "The companies collectively handles a *lot* of this stuff. All of this *pizzazzo* that is the *crown of stability*..."
Does the lieutenant care about the kids? Check this out! This dicemaker sounds serious.
It's a critical mass. Everyone loses. One from whom we can all work. And together we will all become the modern-day Ignus.
*Bean*! What is it beaming down your throat? You need to get *in there*.
"Phmph..." Her voice is almost soft.
Officer Pretending doesn't really smell like real shit.
"In the Age of Conscience," he nods. "A 12 month old."
"I found some forgotten filament memory that's been lying around..."
"When are you going to get those cuffs, Andre?"
"I don't even know what's on this coast. I don't even know what name this place derives from... Maybe it does, I don't know."
Maybe make an example of him. (Opt in.)
"Something... more? How?"
Oh... it's pretty bad. You should drop this. Very badly.
"Mm. Yeah, you see, that was a *mainstream* book-style book. They don't do that well on the literatureside."
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
So, the cryptozoologist is back. And still wearing his ceramic liver.
"I'll walk, but won't I talk?"
"I'm not okay with this. My body *needs* to grow back."
Kim 'TipTop' Kim, that *risque* speed rat -- a freak of the wetlands.
He raises his right arm and nods. "This strike would destabilize the employer."
"I'm not blowing it."
Four... yeah, there's more. Let's make it four, okay?
There was a time when you could climb the ladder to the roof, use the radio to call the library, use the fridge to freeze the victim's body, but that was in the late thirties.
*"There's a weird bug... a bug in your ear."
A bronze ribbon twists the bills of a young man, encircled by letters. The letters read: 'LOOK OUT'.
Good. I'm going home, I shouldn't bother you... (Start fiddling with the printout.)
*Butt-Fucking-Dude*, Cuno! The God damn *butt-fucking-dude* is coming for you.
Take off your pants, they belong in the sea.
World domination aside, the exterior's pure delight.
